1mbi9cr,n5osrb0,AustraliaTravel,the-boss-lady16,1753740388.0,are the sights worth it in Kakadu for just the aboriginal rocks itself? Seems like I can get crocs in Nitmiluk so then not sure what other landscape views I am trading in with Kakadu for that longer drive?
1mbi9cr,n5ovwl6,AustraliaTravel,Coalclifff,1753741389.0,"Nitmiluk NP is very scenic, but sort of a one-trick pony - with a series of red-rock gorges.  Kakadu has a lot more variety, and a lot more crocodiles!  The Yellow Waters cruise at Cooinda is wonderful.  There's not a lot of difference in the travel times between the two."
1dgsweq,l8s3zo1,RitaFourEssenceSystem,LongTallSalski,1718489316.0,"In my GG i talked with Rita about my fears of losing my style when travelling. I tend to end up in Lost Girl mode when I’m dressing only for practicality. Extravagant was one of the keywords she gave to help me consider my style needs. This helped me create an incredibly satisfying outfit for this day trip.   Situation: very long road trip to Nitmiluk National Park, hiking at Katherine Gorge and a swim at Leliyn (Edith Falls).   I wanted to look bright, intentional and badass for this adventure. I planned around the purple crop, which I knew would be more comfortable to hike/swim in than a bikini top. The chunky necklace is lightweight and not fiddly. I discovered the black denim shorts aren’t great for steep climbs but they were fine for the gentler sections of the 7km trail. I was almost going to pick a no-nonsense practical shirt, but decided to go tropical instead, like some kind of shipwrecked fool wandering in the desert. The checked red cord shirt protected against the morning chill.   Keywords: elemental+extravagant, intriguing+dramatic.   Slide 2: welcome to Jawoyn Country. The national park is managed by its traditional owners, who have been using the area continuously for more than 40,000 years. It is known as Nitmiluk. “Nitmi” translates to cicada, luk is “place of”. I’ve included some of my favourite photos from the day here for a sense of context."

1nj6xjy,neojclt,OutdoorAus,ChiWod10,1758105192.0,Hi would you accept a story about Nitmiluk National Park in the NT? And when’s the deadline
1jmcga2,mkax8cl,darwin,no-pressuree,1743219137.0,"Unfortunately this time of the year many spots are cut off due to the rain. Still plenty of water holes etc they just might not be ‘off the beaten track’.  Nitmiluk is awesome during the wet season, southern rock hole is a great swimming spot with a waterfall, you can hike in or get a little boat (some hike in and boat out). The gorge itself is beautiful.  Litchfield has plenty of spots, try Green Ant water hole etc.  hopefully others can give you some more tips. Enjoy the NT"
1lfy6d4,mys24ge,darwin,Ajaxeler,1750408728.0,Kakadu is still very closed and most of it won't be open until July. Id go with Litchfield since you want swimming but most campsites are probably booked out since it's school holidays but you can try online.  So Katherine might be your best bet you just need to walk to any swimming hole or catch an expensive ferry  Umbrawarra is a good option as well if there are spots.
1ih6nh2,maur48d,Bushwalking,AussieEquiv,1738635913.0,"I haven't tried for the Jatbula, but experience similar issues for other hikes (like Thornsborne Trail, Hinchinbrook) they're super popular and disappear in an instant. In QLD commercial/group permits are generally a separate system (on top of private bookings). Looks like you might be able to convince NT Parks that you are seasoned hikers (as a group) and hike outside the regular season;    >If you wish to walk out of season, you must be an experienced group or organisation.    https://nt.gov.au/parks/find-a-park/nitmiluk-national-park/nitmiluk-national-park-jatbula-trail   1 week outside of 'the' season might still be ok for experienced walkers?     It most definitely sucks, especially when people cancel a week before, but that's not enough time (for most people) to drop everything and make use of the free slot."
1drwi1s,layersp,darwin,Best-Brilliant3314,1719739279.0,"I’d suggest hiring a car; I think just about everywhere will offer several days rental and it would make Darwin A LOT easier to get around. Litchfield is a hour out of Darwin but Adelaide River is worth a look as well, so a day trip would cover both. Bring your bathers, pack some water (about five litres for two people), grab some cheese and bacon rolls from Colesworth to snack on. Everywhere that requires a 4WD says so and a 2WD is absolutely fine for 90% or the park. Kakadu is three hours away from Darwin and parts of it are best in the morning so I’d suggest a tour and/or accommodation for that. Nitmiluk Gorge is three hours from Darwin and Jabiru and is worth visiting. Territory Wildlife Park and Berry Springs are a full-ish day and you’ll be back in the city for dinner.  Have a look at what’s available https://northernterritory.com/"
1drwi1s,layl7ib,darwin,agentjm12,1719743956.0,"I just spent 7 nights in the Top End - 1 in Darwin, 2 in Lifchfield, 2 in Katherine (for Nitmiluk and Mataranka/Bitter Springs) and 2 in Kakadu. For me, the highlights were in the national parks as opposed to any more time in Darwin, so you might feel the same if you like the outdoors.   Hiring a car was excellent. Gives you so much flexibility and you can also avoid the peak times when all the tour groups roll in.   We only had a 2WD and were able to access many places, except for some of the just opened 4WD only roads in Kakadu. You might be able to do Litchfield from Darwin, but I would definitely recommend staying in Kakadu and near Nitmiluk.   Happy to share more from my experience if it will help."
1drwi1s,layxrkh,darwin,stevecantsleep,1719751286.0,"The 250km a day thing is annoying though over 7 days and a careful itinerary you will manage - Darwin to Litchfield to Mataranka to Ubirr to Darwin is around 1300km and 7 days gives you 1750 so plenty for detours. And you don't need to go all the way to Mataranka (though it is worth it). If Mataranka is too far, then I think you should still do Nitmiluk - it's a bit of a triangle between Darwin, Katherine and Jabiru so it makes sense. Edith Falls is worth a look, too.  I have actually never done any of the Kakadu sites that need a 4WD but hear they are impressive - but you'll get a great taste with Cooinda, Nourlangie, Ubirr and if you are keen to see, say Jim Jim or Twin Falls you could check out a tour from Jabiru. That would likely be cheaper than a 4WD hire for the whole week. Another good option is a scenic flight over Kakadu. But a 2WD trip will be good."

18e2ic1,kcln1xp,darwin,krickykrak,1702100325.0,"Also if you want to do a magnificent hike, Nitmiluk is stunning or a lot of hikes around Jabiru to see rock art."
14xe8uu,jrmyqm0,australia,Flick-tas,1689143146.0,"At Nitmiluk, rent a canoe for half a day, it's great, a little pricey but worth it IMO... I loved it so much I'm returning next week to do it again, lol  (I'd avoid Tennant Creek, ok for cheap fuel but not a good place to spend a night, high crime and such)"
12qr1a1,jgug3ec,australia,Alect0,1681881186.0,"I love the outback too and never find it boring so can understand why you find it appealing. I haven't done the Nullabor yet (next year) but there seems to be heaps of things to see along the way. I would download Wikicamps (it's worth the price) to find campsites and points of interest.   On the highways, it's easy enough and plenty of mobile phone service most of the time or enough traffic if you are in a spot without it you can flag for help but if you go off road I would recommend taking something like a Zoleo (don't necessarily need a sat phone). You can suspend the service when you no longer need it. You could probably do most of what you want without going offroad.  As far as a route you could do Melbourne (haha I am biased as I live there so all my trips start there) to Twelve Apostles to Adelaide to Lake Hillier to Perth (Rottnest Island) to Broome to Nitmiluk to Darwin to Daintree then through Cairns on your way down to Brisbane to Three Sisters/Sydney then fly home from there. A rough plan on google shows this is about 136h of driving.   This skips Uluru though it's more inner Australia and out of the way. You could always go to Uluru from Nitmiluk then to the Three Sisters across to Sydney and work your way up to Cairns and Daintree through Brisbane (another 46h driving then you have to figure out where to go to fly home after that if you didn't want to back track much, maybe fly to Brisbane and go home from there). Uluru adds a significant detour so it is awkward to fit it in tbh. I LOVED Uluru (particularly Kata Tjuta) though so definitely recommend it. It is not bleak and dangerous along the Stuart Highway to get there but I would avoid driving from dusk onwards as risk of animal strike is high (dingos, wedgetailed eagles, roos, cows, occasionally a camel makes an appearance as well).  NT and outback SA have been my favourite trip places. If you do go through the inner part places I liked that aren't too hard or desolate are Palm Valley, Mereenie Loop, Kings Canyon (my favourite walk ever), Flinders Ranges, Coober Pedy (weirdest town ever), Birdsville Track, Ooodnadatta Track.   I could write for hours on this topic but I will leave it there, feel free to ask any questions!"
12qr1a1,jh9886f,australia,KingJimmy101,1682160386.0,"I’ve just done a 6 month lap. Melbourne-Eyre Penninsula- Nullarbor- Kalgoorlie- Esperance - Margaret River - Bunbury - Perth - Pinnacles a Kalbarri - Denmark/Monkey Mia - Coral Bay - Ningaloo - Exmouth - Karajini NP - 80 mile - Broome - Cape Leveque - Derby - Horizontal Falls - Gibb River Road - Kununurra- Lake Argyle - Katherine - Litchfield NP - Darwin - Three Ways - Mt Isa - Winton - Longreach - Rockhampton- QLD central coast - Coffs Harbour - Sydney - Melbourne.   This is just a high level list of locations we went to. Three months isn’t long enough in my opinion. You will undoubtedly spend more time in your car then actually enjoying the trip. That’s not to say the drive isn’t fun, it’s just you won’t actually spend time with the people, taking the time to see things and experience a location for what it is rather than what people tell you it is.   Antique shops and golf courses weren’t even on our radar and we still didn’t see everything we wanted to.   Also, doing it alone will be dangerous considering the distances you will travel. My wife and I shared the driving and did just on 30,000km in 6 months. Some 10 hour days.   Perhaps consider half a lap. Adelaide - Flinders Ranges - Coober Pedy - Red Centre- Three Ways - Litchfield NP - Darwin and then choose which way - left in WA or right into QLD.   I have friends currently doing exactly this. They’ve chosen WA as it is bloody mammoth and magnificent. And coming back through the middle.   You might want to check out Facebook groups like Planning a Lap of Australia or The Gibb River Road, Kimberley and Pilbara region.   As someone mentioned download WikiCamps. If you plan on camping in national parks get a parks pass for WA. You need to book 180 days out to get into some camp grounds in WA.   There is literally nothing like the Ningaloo coast anywhere else in the world. You need to take your time here. Bring a snorkel.   This country is massive mate. I’ve done some big drives in the USA. Nevada and Utah in a big loop including the north rim and through four ways and all the amazing national parks. Also Seattle down to San Fran. It’s nothing like that. There are more than 300 million people spread across the US. We have 26 mill. Towns are small, you need to plan and you need to not rush.   Hopefully this gives you a bit to go on. Good luck and safe travels."
14xjis7,jrnfau8,travel,heliepoo2,1689156479.0,"Thanks! We haven't been but had a break planned in Litchfield on the drive to Nitmiluk. Hopefully we should be able to see the termite mounds and one of the falls.    We aren't allowed to take the van on unpaved roads so will have to wait for the next time for anything like that. Eventually we are thinking we'd go from Perth to Adelaide, going around the northern area and then through Alice Springs."
118u520,j9j523o,darwin,Odd-Respect-5833,1677059984.0,"I stayed at the cabins in Nitmiluk, they were decent"
118u520,j9mberl,darwin,Ieseyes,1677111351.0,"I'd stay at Knotties or the contour. And the southern rockhole at Nitmiluk is amazing, had some family visiting from interstate go there for a swim."
ubanyn,i63drjv,australia,onnit_onnit,1650862621.0,"Fraser needs a 4WD, all the tracks are deep, powdery sand. So might make more sense to do that as a tour.  Nitmiluk has multi day walks aside from Jatbula that go up the gorge, with water tanks to fill up along the way. As someone else said, carrying a lot of water on trails like Jatbula is the main challenge as there will probably be no flowing water along the trails in July.  If you are in that region you can easily do Kakadu, Litchfield and Nitmiluk in a week or two. If you're into longer walks, Litchfield doesn't have any, Kakadu has day walks up to 20km (Jim Jim, Yurmikmik and the Nourlangie Barrk walk)."
12spmrt,jgznm9u,darwin,Ravanast,1681978562.0,Southern Rockhole Nitmiluk? It only stopped raining 2 days ago… yes it will be flowing
we97vt,iimqwbg,UltralightAus,OkYak,1659441006.0,Good to know thanks.  This site does actually suggest there’s helis but at my expense.  https://nt.gov.au/parks/find-a-park/nitmiluk-national-park/nitmiluk-national-park-jatbula-trail
