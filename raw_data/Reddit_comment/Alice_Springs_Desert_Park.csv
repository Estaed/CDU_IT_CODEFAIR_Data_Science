1je0c6u,mienb83,AskAnAustralian,jghaines,1742287941.0,"Alice Springs is a great town. It‚Äôs got the small town friendliness. But for it size it is very progressive and has a large arts scene.   The media loves to give attention incidents in Alice Springs, but the main thing you‚Äôll experience in day to day life is the need for increase home security.   Not a lot of tech jobs around. Your partner might want to look at remote work."

The answers here range from don't go it's dangerous to you should go but never leave your house and build a compound fence.  There are massive social and economic issues that are only getting worse. You WILL have multiple negative interactions with people in Alice Springs. You WILL be yelled at and harassed, and depending where you are that might be a very common thing.

1je0c6u,migykmf,AskAnAustralian,Runtywhoscunty,1742318983.0,"Alice Springs is honestly a lovely amazing place and community.   Darren Clarke runs action for Alice 2020 on fb and has the best bakery in town. (Best pies in the NT I reckon) Top top bloke.   I did FIFO in and out of Alice Springs for 3 years - I absolutely love the place.  However, it has a dark side.   Anything you think you know about the indigenous - you‚Äôre in for a shock, so be prepared. You‚Äôll see a lot of things you don‚Äôt understand and can‚Äôt make sense of.   I stopped doing fifo because I simply didn‚Äôt feel safe.   My straw that broke the camels back was a Wednesday night, I was playing trivia at uncles tavern (awesome place, amaaazzzing waffle fries) and it was 20:45, I went out for a smoke, (and uncles tavern is surrounded by big black iron metal gates), I was standing outside, and this absolute mob of young indigenous kids (aged 8 - 12 ish) came up to me and the ringleader said ‚Äúoi, give us a fckn smoke‚Äù.  And I said ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt you be in bed?‚Äù And this kid looks me in the eye, and he said ‚Äúgive me a fckn smoke now or I‚Äôll ram this iron gate so far up your cunt youll bleed out of your eyes like the cunt I killed yesterday‚Äù.   The look in this kids eyes is something I‚Äôll never forget. Like a cross between pure hate and just plain malevolence.   So I went and got security. He just shrugged.  He said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do anything, he‚Äôs indigenous, he‚Äôs untouchable‚Äù.   I love Alice Springs, always will - but be safe. If you go out at night - stay in well lit areas, don‚Äôt trust the longrassers and try to stay somewhere gated / locked."

Australia‚Äôs centre can get under your skin, in a good way - it‚Äôs the essence, the spirit of Australia, you will feel it. If people you hear hating on it maybe it‚Äôs because of what they heard or their own experience & I hope doesn‚Äôt put you off going. Make sure you visit Araluen the art centre & the many gorges.  I lived in Milner Rd not far from Araluen.  There is so much to see and do.  And if you have a few days a trip to Uluru is the best.  Or, if you have a lot of nrg - the Larapinta Trail.  Starts from Telegraph Station. Try not to let what you have heard stop you going as it is worth the experience. You will find out what NOT to do to remain safe. Alice Springs is still the big centre of the NT & operates as that.  It saddens me to hear all the bad things happening as I think it‚Äôs special. Have faith & stay safe.  Cheers :-)."
1je0c6u,mieq6yd,AskAnAustralian,AggravatingCrab7680,1742289838.0,"There's quite a turnover in Alice Springs, because it's a place where shit white people go to experience not being bottom of the shit pile for the only time in their lives.  Avoid these people, don't pander to aboriginal people, they're not stupid, always leave the house with a pocketful of change and don't go walking alone at night for any reason.  edit: I should say that you shouldn't go outside alone after dark anywhere in Australia. Sure, everyone has a right to go anywhere unmolested, I completely agree. Just like I've got the right to go for a swim in the ocean anytime I please, so long as I can fight off a Bull Shark."

We were told when we arrived to desist from going out at night but we saw nothing to worry about, so we did go out every night for dinner, on one occasion, walking a couple of kms to an area many people designated as ""trouble"". Well, we never encountered any acts of aggression or related problems. In fact, we were often greeted with a ""good evening"" by the many people we saw wherever we walked.

Plan for 5 years, do not take valuables with you and do not leave your house at night or even slightly unsecured. Check that your address that you're moving too isn't subject to alcohol restrictions (they're locked down by house) and drive an GM as it can't be easily stolen since the whole ignition barrel breaks when they try and bypass the starter motor.  Alice Springs is decorated in indigenous art as those things will not be or will be less likely to be destroyed.

There‚Äôs a great art scene, beautiful beaches but you‚Äôre still close enough to the Kimberley‚Äôs and Pilbara for those beautiful gorges and sites very similar to the likes of Alice Springs. It‚Äôs a big enough town where there‚Äôs plenty of shops, but still a country town. With heaps of backpackers being around for half the year there‚Äôs that opportunity for a fun night out, whilst the other half of the year you can enjoy the quiet of the town and it‚Äôs beautiful storms.

Now the roads in and out are lined with dirty roadside camps of alcoholics who want to be close to the bottle shops and meth dealers.   Bring in the Chinese to nuke Pine Gap and the toxic CIA who run it and are most likely supplying the meth, and that will clean the whole place up beautifully. No Pine Gap. No US military. Get used to the idea."
1je0c6u,miexeyu,AskAnAustralian,Scamwau1,1742294143.0,That's a hot take. What stats are you seeing that suggest Alice Springs is safer than the entire state of Queensland?
1je0c6u,miwmjsh,AskAnAustralian,AggravatingCrab7680,1742522819.0,"Not a great comparison. El Salvador has drug smuggling/people smuggling gangs dealing in huge sums of money and with heavy connections in politics, the police and military inside and outside El Salvador.

1je0c6u,mjm0pi5,AskAnAustralian,Enough_Fan3449,1742881479.0,"From what I've read the locals who used to live in Alice Springs prior to the major tourist attraction being closed down have said it used to be a beautiful place. But now that the money isn't coming in so much from tourism the major drawcard is the bottle shops. The camps have appeared along the major highways and they are filthy, apparently, and an eyesore for any travellers. The trip advice is to keep driving through and stop for petrol only.  In recent years the media reported the major violent outbreaks by youths and vandalism in the town that nobody could control, especially the police. Locals were calling for the military and PM to intervene. But we knew what the outcry would be from that: r-a-c-i-s-m.   So the gist is to just let the town die out. Or better still, let the Chinese nuke it along with Pine Gap."

1ljykcw,mzohr4m,AskAnAustralian,YippyDippyDVDs,1750851433.0,"Worked a job that had me going through there pretty regularly, mostly during daylight hours, occasionally night-time. Daytime, it's the same as any small town. Most people trying to go about their day, using common sense to avoid trouble. Night-time is when more trouble happens, but as told to me by a fella who was a cop there for many years, ""Ignorance is bliss. Put the roller shutters down and don't think too hard about it."" Also important to note, the most common victims of Aboriginal violence is Aboriginal women and children. Yes, not all the violence and issues are within the Aboriginal community, but it's what visitors are worried about whether they say it or not.   Beyond all that, I can truthfully say that Alice Springs, its people, and its surroundings, is easily one of my top 5 favourite places in this country. The natural beauty of the area cannot be overstated. Many of the locals are truly passionate about living there and share that passion in an infectious way. And for being the place geographically furthest inland that is inhabited in any substantial way, the sushi is actually pretty good!"
1ljykcw,mznm5tx,AskAnAustralian,None,1750834122.0,"So, without giving too much of my personal information away, I work for Parks Victoria, in a fairly specialised role that required me to do a bit of training in Alice Springs, at the Alice Springs Reptile Centre.  As a non-indigenous, white man, I'll say this: The media like to blow the goings on in Alice Springs up as much as they can, simply because it gets attention and it sells column inches.   There are established, genuine problems in Alice Springs, and pretty much everyone knows that, but it is nowhere near as bad as you'll see on 7 News.   Would I go walking down the main Street with an ""Aussie Pride"", Pro-Colonization t-shirt with union jacks all over it on? Absolutely not  Are you likely to get randomly mugged in the street? Also probably not. At least you're no more likely to get randomly mugged there than you are in any other big Australian city.  As with anywhere, common sense is the key.  Obviously don't approach anyone that's clearly intoxicated or clearly affected by drugs, it's probably not going to end well for you, no matter how much you might want to help.   Otherwise, if you're not going out of your way to piss them off, they're not going to piss you off."
1ljykcw,mzsppsi,AskAnAustralian,Whole_Ad3374,1750897467.0,"Hubby and I went as we did a road trip from Alice Springs to Uluru and back. In total stayed 3 nights in Alice and to this day it‚Äôs one of our favourite trips. There is nothing to do there but we enjoyed just walking around and driving around and exploring. At sunset the place is bloody incredible.   HOWEVER, our hotel room was broken into by 2 women who were well known to the security there within 5 minutes of us putting our bags down. We also saw a girl get punched in the face by her boyfriend on the street.   But we honestly never felt unsafe personally ourselves. Just don‚Äôt walk around after dark by yourself with belongings or do anything obviously stupid like that. Also when we went the shops were closed all day everyday - Woolies and 2 cafes were open but all other shops like the Kmart and shopping centre were closed. I‚Äôm not sure how it is now."
1ljykcw,mznqdk7,AskAnAustralian,Unusual-Ear5013,1750836500.0,"It‚Äôs slightly dodgy in that there‚Äôs a gang of teenagers causing merry havoc and trying to emulate hip-hop stars by making gangs and what not.

You just have to be careful situationally ‚Äì Don‚Äôt leave valuables in your car, don‚Äôt wear valuables ideally when you‚Äôre walking and don‚Äôt really walk around at night time.

1ljykcw,mznpfpi,AskAnAustralian,None,1750835956.0,">Alice gets described as much, much worse than it is.  And that's because, without getting too political, Australia has an inherent bias against First nations peoples, and as such, whenever any kind of negative news comes out of places like Alice Springs, it gets sensationalized, and it feeds back into people's preconceived notions and bias.   The general attitude around Welcome to Country, and the comments sections on social media following an AFL game where one took place is all the proof you need to corroborate this.   We talk about reconciliation and a pathway to unity. As someone that works with First nations peoples pretty much everyday, I can tell you that we are a hell of a lot further away than most people would like to think, and it almost entirely comes down to a lack of education, awareness, and the fact that people just don't want to be educated and don't care."

Not many Nomads which made parking easier as they suck in the same racist BS media that PHON and Murdoch use to flog their wares. Life still tough for many indigenous Aussies. Lack of jobs for young kids makes it hard for indigenous youth. Loved seeing the many aboriginal men and women selling their art at the many events over the time we were there.

I didn't feel safe unless I was at home, and even then we still got broken into (along with everyone else on our road).   If you do move Id suggest investing the better areas (there's not really good suburbs, there's bad spots everywhere but some better than others) and be willing to invest in good security.

Tbh though man this is an easy chatGPT question:  ChatGPT response:   Alice Springs exists mainly because it became an important stopover and service point in the middle of Australia ‚Äî basically halfway between Adelaide and Darwin ‚Äî for both communication and transportation.  Here‚Äôs how it happened:  * **Telegraph Line**: In the 1870s, the Australian Overland Telegraph Line was built to connect Australia to the rest of the world via undersea cable from Darwin. They needed repeater stations every few hundred kilometers, and Alice Springs (then known as Stuart) was chosen as one because it had a semi-reliable water source nearby (the Todd River and a waterhole called ""Alice Spring""). * **Cattle and Exploration**: Around the same time, pastoralists (cattle ranchers) started moving into Central Australia. Alice Springs became a base for them because it was one of the few places with access to water and supplies. * **Railway**: Later on, it also became a stop on the Central Australia Railway (the old ""Ghan""), which made it even more important for trade and travel across the continent. * **Military**: During World War II, the town exploded in size because it was a major staging area for troops moving to northern Australia.

The quality/completeness of the crime data in Central Australia was (and remains) absolutely shocking. It has always been hampered by the fact that groups living in Alice Springs report/ don't report certain types of crime at staggeringly different rates.   The ""higher crime rates are bad because crime is bad"" vs ""higher crime rates are good because it's actually just an increase in reporting rates which is what we need to solve the underlying issue"" is a debate that has been going back and forth in this area (and others) for decades.

1jgi8hs,mjabmbg,howislivingthere,Frosty_Cicada791,1742723067.0,"Honestly, although its easy to point out the issues and cruticize, its harder for me to actually point out a solution, partially due to the fact that i am not super familiar with the systems of land ownership and even rule of law or social hierarchy in traditional communities or outstations. I would love for an aboriginal who lives in one of these communities to be part of the coversation. But the level of violence that aboriginal communities experience and that others in the outback are subjected to as a result is very destructive and beginning to be a subject of national embarrasment. I heard a story of an italian backpacker that was machete'd to death for telling a group of aboriginal youth to pick up their litter (somewhere in north queensland i believe?) Since foreigners see australia as a very safe country, thry are much less likely to be ""streetwise"" in situations like this when visiting certain areas of the country in order to avoid being victims of semi random violence. There's no doubt that the rise of social liberalism in bigger australian metropolitan areas and the switch from seeing aboriginals as savages to doing land acnowledgements and venerating some sort of sanitized version of their culture (almost viewing them as ""noble savages"") has somewhat emboldened aboriginal youth to commit crimes against european australians as some sort of ""revenge"", causing increased racism against aboriginals by white people, with people bringing up the old native police, threatening to bring back their ""grandfather's hunting licenses"", etc. The whole situation is getting more and more tense and being completely ignored, since the population densities of the outback are so low and everything is so isolated. The government needs to seriously look at the management of government funds by leaders in aboriginal communities, and punish those who embezzle them accordingly. It then needs to take a much more active role in making sure aboriginal youth attend regular education and have less access to alcohol and drugs, and put stricter punishments in place for violent offenders. There also needs to be greater investments in infrastructure and economic incentives to ensure aboriginals have places to work, which is difficult due to how isolated they are (the only real jobs are in cattle stations much of the time). Beyond that, it is a cultural issue. The importance of family groups, and fights between them, as well as the level of violence against others (and against women, which is abysmal) are cultural holdovers from the tribal days. There is no pretty solution here, which is why stealing the children and attempting to ""re educate"" them was attempted in the past (after the pastorialists had forced them off all the good grazing land, of course), but the reality of the present day situation is that, unfortunately, aboriginals have to assimilate to the settled way of life, which is something these groups have largely completely failed to do. Their complete reliance on government handouts has to change also (most of them do not work, another fact which causes resentment). I would love for a pure blooded aboriginal (not someone with 1/4 aboriginal blood, as the situation is likely very different for them) from the alice springs area to provide a better insight. In my time in australia, in the interior, i didnt have much of an opportunity to get any persectives like that unfortunately."

Went out for dinner at night,  all fine.  I think you'll find enough to do,  the desert nature park is excellent and if it has reopened the evening tour is amazing (it wasn't open in 2021 but was when I went in 2013, when I also spent an early evening crying in the banks of the Todd River after a fight with a friend who I was staying with and still felt safe,  even when approached by groups who just wanted to check that I was ok) the day and evening openings are compelling different so do both. Check the times of the bird shows etc because they are great. The reptile park was good if you are into that.

We stayed in a hostel called Jump Inn which I liked, it was nice by hostel standards but obviously not comapred to hotels. We mostly did organised tours, a 3 day one of Uluru, camel riding, Kangaroo santruary, and we cycled to see the School of the Air, which is the remote school for kids living too far to travel for primary school. We also did a day hiking trip. I would have loved to go to Hermmansburg but we were in the wrong season, we did have a look at some local art galleries. I spent 7 days there filled the time pretty easily.   I would not have wanted to be driving myself to all these places just because everything is very far and the drive would get a little repetive and time consuming.

I fell in love nearly instantly.  It's the first place where I actually saw and got to talk with Aboriginal, and got to share a bit of culture and view on life. It has been hard for me to do so before Alice Springs. However, there's a big divide between them and the ""white"" locals that was sometimes shocking, with that bar that for example had an entrance for the white and one for the black fellas, and the inside room being divided in two as well.   Lots of stories of crime, and everybody there knows about someone who had issues coming back late at night. Most of the crime though is perpetrated by kids and teenagers who are lost and not really cared for by their parents, or that is at least what I understood and got from conversations. It shows the impact colonization had on the populations here.  Alcohol seemed to be a big issue, and I even experienced a semi-ban on it. You'd be limited to a certain amount per person per week, and they'd check your ID every time you'd buy some.   On the other hand, one of the most diverse place in terms of humans I've ever seen. Strong Asian communities, lots of backpackers, kiwis and pacific islanders, Australians both locals and from other states, queers and bogans, quirky elders and dynamic young people. But above all, and insane sense of community. Everybody being welcoming, sharing stories, giving tips and helping moving in, moving out, finding jobs or just attending regular and unregular events equally with enthusiasm. Tourists melting in every now and then for big events like Finke or the Larapinta trail winter season.  The bush is beautiful, ochre red with patches of green here and there, hills and valleys. Occasional big rains will make the Todd flow for a week or so if you're lucky, and leave the outback green and verdoyant for a month or more after that. People say you're a local if you see the river flow three time actually. And then, all year long, water holes are little haven hidden between red rocks where people adventure to get a swim and escape the town for a day or two if they like camping.   Honestly, a magical place that leaves no one neutral. Go there with an open mind and heart and you'll truly be surprised by the life of ordinary people there. Love and kisses to my Alice fellas"

1mtoz12,n9i3dd8,geography,Commercial_River7262,1755597427.0,"I am currently working in an Indigenous community in South Australia (SA). Once a month, we usually travel to Alice Springs for grocery shopping and other necessities.  It is an interesting place, largely because of its remoteness. As has often been pointed out, it is difficult to attract people to live and work there. especially for jobs considered ‚Äúmenial‚Äù or less specialized.  For example, as a Canadian citizen on a Working Holiday Visa, one of my options to extend my stay in Australia beyond one year (for two or even three years) is to complete specified work in the Northern Territory (NT) in the service industry in places like Darwin or Alice Springs.   This requirement means that I am far from alone: many Working Holiday Visa holders find themselves in Alice Springs, making it a surprisingly international town despite its isolation.  At the same time, Alice Springs faces a complex social reality. Australia‚Äôs colonial past was devastating for its Indigenous peoples. Through violence, dispossession, and policies aimed at assimilation. Unlike in many parts of the country, the Anangu people survived largely because they lived deep within Central Australia‚Äôs desert lands, which were difficult for settlers to exploit. Today, the Anangu remain very much present and active in their communities and culture.  Yet serious challenges persist. Education is particularly difficult to deliver in such remote areas.   Access to everyday services and infrastructure ; ** things most Australians take for granted ** is often limited or absent ; We had to close the school due to vicious dogs attacking people. I once couldn't get my click & Collect order at Coles (grocery store) because someone died there a few days prior.    Many communities struggle with high rates of unemployment, alcohol and substance abuse, and what was once widespread petrol sniffing.   According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians in very remote areas is more than four times higher than for non-Indigenous Australians. Life expectancy remains about 8 years lower for Indigenous people compared to the national average.  Trying to undo more than two centuries of colonial dispossession is a task that remains extremely challenging."

What's new is gangs of¬†preteens, many of whom suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome, brain damage from sniffing glue etc,¬†who have effectively no adult supervision and roam the streets breaking into cars and houses, robbing people, etc, and the police and justice system are very limited in what they can do in response."

Mr Haig and another officer then intervened.  Asst Comm Wurst rejected calls for an independent investigation into the death in custody earlier in the week, as the situation in Alice Springs remains volatile.  The man‚Äôs grandfather, Warlpiri Elder Ned Jampijinpa Hargraves, said on Wednesday that he and the wider Central Australia community were ‚Äúdevastated by this death‚Äù and called for ‚Äúanswers and justice‚Äù, while remaining ‚Äúin the dark about what really happened‚Äù.  Mr Hargraves criticised the police for ‚Äúputting out stories that portray my \[grandson\] as a criminal‚Äù, calling for all available video footage to be released publicly.  ‚ÄúWhat are the police doing using such force on a vulnerable young man in a supermarket? Did they even try to de-escalate?‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúThis happened on the fifth anniversary of death of George Floyd ‚Äì during Reconciliation Week ‚Äì but my people have to confront another death in custody. My people are being routinely brutalised by police. We are going to jail in record numbers ‚Äì men, women and children alike.  ‚ÄúWe cannot tolerate the situation, with continued brutality and lack of respect. We will be calling for action from supporters to demand accountability, justice and self-determination. The deaths and the racism need to stop.‚Äù  Political leaders have urged the community to remain calm as the investigation progresses.  It is unclear what rank Mr Haig was serving in, but as a constable in 2009 was awarded a commendation for ‚Äúoutstanding self-discipline and personal courage‚Äù for his actions relating to a fire at a block of residential units on Kempe Street.  Multiple sources who know Mr Haig described him as an ‚Äúold school cop‚Äù who had faced disciplinary action in recent years for use of force and other matters.  A police source said the incident is likely to be ‚ÄúZach Rolfe 2.0‚Äù, referring to the shooting death of Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu during an attempted arrest in November 2019, that garnered national attention and stoked racial tensions in the Northern Territory.  Mr Rolfe was charged with murder and later acquitted in the Supreme Court.  Coroner Elisabeth Armitage conducted a more than two-year long inquest into the shooting death of Mr Walker and is scheduled to hand down her findings in Yuendumu on June 10, with the inquest examining the extent of systemic racism in the NT Police force. NT Courts said yesterday the Coroner was still planning to attend the community, but indicated it did not know ‚Äúwhether the recent events will affect these plans‚Äù."

An Australian soldier looks over Alice Springs, Central Australia   The Japanese were identified as a threat to Australia in 1920 but it wasn‚Äôt until 1940 that this translated to men on the ground here. From Alice Springs and up ‚Äòthe track‚Äô to Darwin they worked to improve the roads and infrastructure for defense. By Feb 1942 the bombs started raining down on Darwin, and Alice became a staging post for men and equipment heading North.  The railway from the South and East coast stopped in the Centre of Australia and hundreds of trucks dragged freight and men the other thousand miles to the North coast. At the peak of the war 5 trains per day were unloaded.   The initial 700 men and 150 trucks in the Transport mob (Darwin Overland Maintenance Force) were soon doubled and re-organised as the ‚ÄòCentral Australian Motor Transport Column‚Äô  With Mount Gillen in the distance, I did not have to scramble around the hills too long to find the location for this picture, all you need  is a boulder with a vertical face, looking to the Southwest. However, to frame the shot accurately I had to come back a few times.  photo from the War memorial https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C26962  There were up to about a dozen camps  for enlisted men and those employed by the government‚Äôs Allied Works Council. Alice population was about 600 before the war and suddenly they needed power water and food for 5000 men.  At the bottom of this hill to the left, just out of sight was the Royal Engineers‚Äô camp. There was a machine gun post in the rocks on this hill 60 metres behind the camera.   A shitty old 1914-1918 Lewis machine gun as anti-aircraft defense was a rather bitter reminder that Australia was far behind in the race to fit out and equip her fighting men.

Instead of traditional boats, contestants carry bottomless boats, such as wheeled frames, and race them down the dry sandy bed of the Todd River.      The regatta is a fun-filled day that includes various events such as boat races, sand shoveling, and even a hilarious 'boat' tossing competition. It is a popular event that attracts both locals and tourists alike.      However, in 1993, the regatta was canceled due to the unusual occurrence of wet weather. The Todd River briefly flooded due to heavy rainfall, making the river unsuitable for the races. It was the first and only time the regatta was canceled due to wet weather.      Despite its unique challenges and occasional setbacks, the Henley-On-Todd Regatta continues to be a beloved tradition in Alice Springs, showcasing the ingenuity, resilience, and sense of humor of the Australian outback."

When we started unloading the containers at 8am, it was already 35 degrees, and the containers were sitting about 150 metres away from the loading door of the venue, which was uphill on black bitumen.  It hit 45 degrees at about 10am, and the 8 of us went through 40 litres of iced powerade mix in three hours. Good thing we had a forklift to get everything up the hill and into the venue.  So we started setting up, and at about 3pm I went outside to have a smoke. It was still 45 degrees, but in the ten minutes it took me to have my cigarette, the temperature dropped to 12 degrees, and a massive storm hit. It was wild. Dark as night, lightning, absolutely pissed down with rain.  The Todd River flash flooded. 3 people died, because they were sleeping off their lunch booze in the shady river bed.  They say that if you see the Todd River flowing three times, you're considered to be a local.

Read through this thread as for 2 days now I have been disgusted by this media stunt in Alice Springs which is an obvious anti Indigenous campaign to support the 'No' stance disguised as pro indigenous support... problem is it's so obvious to most except the racists which want/need that food.  Then you have any comment in this thread that adds some reason and insight into the case of there are serious issues within Indigenous communities attacked blindly with ignorant logic.  Is everyone these days black and white in their thinking? Watched on ABC yesterday another speaker more or less state the issues in Alice Springs of both crime and other matters is no different to many other communities and real. They all need more and better support. Both sides of Government have neglected many things far too long resulting in where this country is today in this regard. Whether the concerns raised are in data or neglected so they do not appear in data is not the factual reality ever... the truth is often a combination of data and reality.  In either case the bottom line is that using such issues for a political anti Indigenous stunt is disgusting. The likely fact that crime and other serious matters are worse than what is actually reported officially just highlights both sides of Government have let this country down through popular politics. This media stunt in Alice also highlights the opposite of its intended false agenda in that a voice might actually help improve some of these issues or at least not let them be forgotten as easily when it is not politically useful.

The issue of child abuse is absolutely well known and documented, it is absolutely tragic when kids literally 11 or 12 commit suicide and the police investigating knew they were being preyed upon but couldn‚Äôt do anything about it.  I haven‚Äôt had experience of living around Alice Springs but from what I see there is no reason to assume the issue would not be prevalent there as it is in other failed communities.  Also, an issue is that obviously very well meaning people straight away condemn any white person raising the issue as right wing or a racist. While obviously these people exist, a very large number of people who raise the issue do so out of genuine care for the children in harm‚Äôs way.  If you‚Äôre interested I suggest reading about Roebourne in WA, nearly every child had been preyed on but little could be done to protect the kids.  Over 50 know pedophiles are still in the community, still getting mindlessly drunk and taking their filthy urges out on either their own kids or kids of parents too drunk or drugged to care , or who just accept it.  The truth is held down by these blind calls of racism that prevent real action."

They have space. I believe the reason Qantas chose California for their A380s is that they have a maintenance base at LAX which isn't too far from where they're stored at Victorville.  Sydney (and maybe Melbourne) airport is closed at night until 6am. Flights between the west coast of the US and Australia all follow a similar schedule: depart late in evening LA time (10p-12a) and arrive at Sydney just after opening (6-8a). This allows time for connecting passengers to arrive from across the US and accounts for SYD being closed at night. Flights from SYD to LAX depart late morning and arrive early morning in LAX, so the aircraft are at LAX for over 12 hours. Qantas decided to use this opportunity to do maintenance on their A380 and 747 aircraft and set up a maintenance facility at LAX."

One crashed long ago or simply landed and later malfunctioned in some way, stranding it in place.

More like 1901 perhaps, as the Federation drought is setting in. The drought didn't break till 1903.  This has all the look and feel of a classic Thomas Bradshaw picture. Bradshaw was Stationmaster here from 1899 to 1908.  Mail came from Adelaide, 1000 miles to the South. Roughly 600 miles by train and the last 400 miles 2 or 3 weeks by camel or coach. Coach more often than not being an open wagon.   The mail was by camel for much of the time. They could only use horses when there wasn't a drought, because of a lack of reliable wells, and there were many droughts through to 1929 when the train line was finally completed...   It was around 1898 that the mail service had improved somewhat, from a six weekly service to a monthly one, and according to Stuart Traynor's notes (history guru)..   Frank Gillen wrote his mate Spencer on 3 April 1898 with ‚ÄòThe mail leaves here tomorrow for the first time under the fortnightly new contract.   Coaches are to leave here and Oodnadatta simultaneously, meet at Horseshoe Bend, exchange mails and return to their respective starting points.   The previous Stationmaster from 1891-1899 Frank Gillen wrote ‚ÄúWells has, I am glad to say, sublet this end of the contract to a good man so that we have a chance of getting our mails regularly ‚Äì We shall receive replies to our letters monthly‚Äù - (My Dear Spencer pp. 211-212)   The mail coach was a high-seated open buggy, not a stagecoach of the type used by Cobb & Co. Stagecoaches operated in outback Queensland but never on the Oodnadatta track.  The four-weekly mail service between Alice Springs and Arltunga, the gold mining area East of Alice increased to fortnightly in 1899. Around this time there were about 300 white people at Arltunga and only a couple of dozen at Alice Springs.  Alice Springs white population only got to 90 by the time the railway got here in 1929.

1hdvtp8,m2a2tt8,australia,AggravatingTartlet,1734321582.0,"It's always vengeance?? That's untrue. As to your scenario -- if you could flick a switch and ensure someone would never commit another crime, although it'd be unethical to experiment on a human like that, of course you could set them free. We would no longer need prisons.  Incarceration will stop someone from battering and raping for the time they are in prison. They might be worse when they get out or they might be better. Whichever way, the community deserves to be safe. of course, prisons should be rehab centres, not places of punishment.  I recognised they are children in my post and said that prison is not appropriate for them. The issue is that the vast majority of children in Australia do not batter babies or commit armed robbery or rape people, so those things are not something children commonly do, and so to make a claim about undeveloped brains is sidestepping the actual issues. If we have issues that extreme, things have gone catastrophically wrong.  You think no one should be in prison? That idea greatly benefits violent criminals (mostly men) and greatly disadvantages women and children. We need facilities that are not like current prisons but is aimed at rehabilitation -- while not allowing violent criminals free and while ensuring the community is safe.  I'm using your terms when I mentioned ""serious criminal and violent thugs"". And I was careful to say that the children are ""acting as"" those things -- I did not say they ARE those things. My comments about FSD & FAE & abuse & drugs do indeed point to diminished capacity. I made mention of those things for that reason. But you still need to help those children while keeping the community safe.  Alice Springs could become almost a ghost town if things continue, with the crime rate escalating among those who remain. Imagine that? An absolute cesspit where men, women and children are dying of crime-related reasons every single day, a place where everyone has experienced sexual abuse.  Male elders have been empowered to solve issues in their own communities many times in the past, over and over. It hasn't worked. It simply isn't working. They don't have the skills or perspectives. That's why the solutions are going to come from Aboriginal women. The men will be included, but the women and children are bearing the absolute brunt of it, and the solutions must come from the women.  As to your last point, as I said, children don't belong in prison. But the adults of those children concerned have repeatedly demonstrated they are not capable of taking care of their own children. They may be battling trauma, IPV, or/and alcoholism themselves, as well as struggling with the general issues within their communities. Those kids deserve to be safe and their communities deserve to be safe.  As I said, something is needed that isn't prison but where kids acting in criminal ways can receive urgent help. Their families should be involved and able to freely visit, while also receiving help.  Young kids cannot be roaming around at night. Young girls should not be getting pregnant. Bans on alcohol can be put into place/put back into place, and that needs to happen alongside consolation with the people involved. Alcohol is absolutely causing devastation. We need to prevent kids being born affected by it.  I find it extremely sad when people state that children as young as ten shouldn't not be held criminally responsible for their actions as if that is an answer to anything. It is no answer. It holds no weight whatsoever. It provides no help for anyone.  Of course children that young can't be criminally responsible, but what needs to be said is, what is the alternative? What should we be doing? And obviously, we should be doing a LOT. There needs to be programs where children committing very serious crimes young ages can be put into and receive intensive help alongside their families -- and, vitally -- work towards preventing these issues happening in the first place."

Our first step involves enhancing community policing initiatives, increasing engagement between law enforcement and local residents through workshops, town hall meetings, and collaborative planning. Empowering community leaders and groups to take an active role in safety measures can help tailor solutions that are culturally sensitive and locally endorsed.  Pillar 2: Education and Prevention Programs Education plays a crucial role in prevention. This pillar focuses on implementing educational programs that promote non-violence, respect, and understanding among community members. We aim to work with schools, local organizations, and experts to develop curricula and community activities that address the root causes of violence, such as social inequality and lack of opportunities.  Pillar 3: Strengthening Legal and Support Frameworks Enhancing the legal response to incidents of violence is essential. This involves not only stringent enforcement of laws but also ensuring that those affected have access to necessary support services. This includes legal aid, counseling, and health services that help victims and work towards rehabilitating offenders. Additionally, we'll advocate for more robust funding and support for local law enforcement to ensure they are well-equipped to handle these challenges.  By implementing this three-pronged approach, we aim to create a safer, more cohesive environment in Alice Springs.  https://preview.redd.it/kxrhgq3h4r2d1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a884037ffe79c3080d34153ec06644ebf9cd9dd"

Roo's that are born in the sanctuary aren't let back in the wild because the Australian government considers them domesticated which means they stand a pretty poor chance of surviving out in the wild due to their social behavior around other roo's, instincts (or lack there of) towards predators and attitudes towards humans (wild roo's would run at the sight of you, domesticated ones *will* attack you if they are male). That being so, most of the roo's in the sanctuary were born there, are injured/unsuitable for reintroduction to the wild, in the possession of someone else and given up or in some cases found by aboriginals who hunt kangaroo's and instead of killing the joey (or taking them as pets) give them to Barolga's safe care.

With his battle cry of ""Faaarrrk'n'El"", Farken'AwesumBloke is his world's foremost protector, fighting for Mateship, a Fair Go, and the preservation of his Centrelink Payments.  Admired and respected by his fellow heroes, he is known for his affable nature, honesty, being a 'top bloke', glorious mullet, racist comments targeted at anyone who isn't an Anglo Australian, and addressing his allies as ""Oi, Cunt!"".  Despite often being the first into the fray (particularly if he's been downing tinnies all arvo) he has sometimes failed to answer the call to arms, claiming he's ""..feeling a bit crook, I must've had a bad snag at the barbie yesterday.."", the use of this excuse after public holidays, long weekends or major sporting events leads many of his compatriots to conclude that he is indeed pulling a Super Sickie.  Farken'AwesumBloke has actually met Kal-El during the Crisis of Metric Shit-tons of Earths, and found him to be totally up-himself and unable to take a joke. The Crisis was a sad time for Farken'AwesumBloke, as his steadfast ally and good mate, the mighty KiwiBro, hurt his back during battle, and has (claimed) to be unable to work full time since, staying home and collecting a disabilty allowance instead.  Maintaining a secret identity in Alice Springs, Farken'AwesumBloke is known to his friends, neighbors and the Alice Springs Police as Gary Graham, a not-mild-mannered-at-all part time diesel mechanic and forklift driver. A well liked fixture at the local TAB, backyard barbies or Lasseters Hotel Casino on Barrett Drive. Gary, or 'Gazza' as he prefers to be known is considered by those who know him to be a good laugh, a good sort (and a 'top root' by his ex-missus).  However, when duty calls, Gaza hops out of his Holden Ute, takes off his Oakley sunnies and springs into action as Farken'AwesumBloke, Earth's foremost defender!  Edit: Bloody'ell! Gold!! My first!!

Ironically this town is a gold mine, people would be surprised to know how many self made millionaires Alice has produced and still does, these people could live anywhere in Australia but this is where the coin is. I've heard of numerous young couples who have moved up here to grind it out and within a few years they own their home out right. This is the strange juxtaposition of Alice Springs. Lawlessness and town camps that are no different to the slums you see in 3rd world countries, while five minutes across town and you find yourself on the golf course estate which is almost exclusively where the wealthy have built their mansions, which is where they keep their Ferrari's and Lamborghinis.  And you know what, they deserve every penny they've made. That's what can happen with a basic education, an apprenticeship and heaps of hard work and dedication, where as sitting on your fat ass and expecting everything to be provided for you on a silver platter by the government breeds nothing but lazy slobs who don't even think looking after their own children is their responsibility."

Often come without any money, expecting to stay with family.   They do what they do usually in communities for millennia which is to fight among each other. Stabbing each other in arms or legs.    Aboriginal communities are not nor have ever been peaceful. This is not surprising since they had to survive in an extremely harsh environment .   The article below is from 2008 and nothing has changed.     News  Alice Springs is `world stabbing capital'  STABBINGS in Central Australia's tourist capital Alice Springs have reached epidemic proportions, and traditional Aboriginal thigh spearing is being blamed.   STABBINGS in Central Australia's tourist capital Alice Springs have reached epidemic proportions, and traditional Aboriginal thigh spearing is being blamed.  Surgeons at Alice Springs Hospital say the town is in crisis, with the number of stab injuries, blunt force injuries, bone breaks and burns admissions rising.  The town now reports the highest rate of stabbings in the world, with 390 incidents for every 100,000 people.  Most concerning, say the medics, is that almost 40 per cent of the stabbings were thigh injuries most likely meted out by Aboriginal elders as traditional punishment.  The practice, designed to settle grievances, is performed by elders who ""have a deep knowledge of human anatomy and are skilled at spearing the femoral artery with deft accuracy,"" Dr Abraham Jacob wrote in a report published in the latest¬†ANZ Journal of Surgery.  The study shows 16 of the 605 Aborigines admitted with thigh stab wounds between 1998 and 2005 were dead on arrival.  ""We found a significant and particular pattern of traditional stab injuries,"" Dr Jacob said.  ""Medial thigh injury to kill, posterior thigh to permanently disable and lateral thigh to punish.""  Contrary to anecdotal reports, women were just as likely to be subjected to the practice as men, and the location was town camps and homes, not streets or pubs as previously thought.  Alcohol played a role in 30 per cent of stabbing admissions.  About 20 per cent of the victims were admitted with stab wounds more than once, and in the same number of cases the victim absconded before they had completed treatment.  Dr Jacob and his colleagues said the study was the first to reveal the extent of injury and death due to traditional spearing, saying it adds to the town's growing poor statistics.  ""Alice Springs has been given the title of the crime capital of Australia, and its town camps have been described as a 'sea of despair' with conditions similar to South African ghetto townships,"" Dr Jacob said.  The camps' population was expected to double in the next five years, speeding up already increasing rates of injury and death.  ""Central Australia's tourist capital is in crisis,"" he said.  ""A multi-pronged approach is needed, engaging Aboriginal leaders, social uplifting and economical support and education of the entire community"

10jygqd,j5o011t,australia,lost89577,1674556477.0,"From someone who lives in alice springs  First off the new idiot mayor was asking for the army because he has no idea how local government works. Just attend a town meeting.  Second the so called extra police for alice springs this year, they spent most of the time in operations in remote communities and very little in town. They also left before the busy season of Christmas when from the 20th dec to mid of January when they go on a house break in rampage every year. Last year it was almost every day of Jan till mid Feb some youth try to break into my place. But I can say last year response by police was time decent, unlike this year's non existence.  If you had driven past the police at night in last 6 months you would have seen that they only had two car out on patrol. So response time is 1 1/2 hours unless emergency then at least 1/2 hour most of the time.  The council does currently pay ""talice security"" to patrol the town at night and watch the cameras, but if seen any of their security officer they are on their phone all night and just stand their and not call in the stolen cars doing burnouts in from of them. if you ask about it they grunt a yes then go back to watching tiktoc.  As to alcohol restrictions, they won't have much effect unless they close the sly goggers in the town camps and it mostly youth stealing alcohol not adults. The youth problem has been getting worst every year since they reduced the funding to a third and redirected the remaining services to limit scope of works. ( they did increase it by 30% after 12 months of major youth issues)   Yes this is also same time they removed the banned drinkers register and we had people partying in the streets for months till they doubled the police in town for a few months.  Youth issue is partly due to culture difference and centerlink payments. Traditionally the aunty and grandmother look after the kids but if the parents want the extra money, they keep the kids on paper. Then dump them on the grandmothers and when their no longer a child under tradition at 13, they do what ever they desire. Where are the parents about half are off living their life on the extra centerlink money.  As for youth corrections that the only place they get a education for most of these youth out on the streets at night. Because the parents see it as school / goverment to educate them not parent's responsibility to send them to school.  Anyway, for me, I have had enough and I am leaving town."

I wouldn't be surprised if some of this is due to the 18-33 demographic not being socialised to alcohol at all.   Lastly, we need to know if the crime epidemic is actually fuelled by alcohol or if it's a correlation or coincidence.

10jygqd,j5o2kqm,australia,CommanderMaxil,1674558543.0,"I do not mean to imply that indigenous youth are necessarily more prone to crime than non-indigenous youth, hence my comment about demographics. It just so happens that the demographics  of central Australia and Alice Springs mean that the poorest communities tend to be aborginal. In other parts of Australia that would not be the case. Its also true that the absolute numbers of youths committing these offence is relatively low, a few dozen at most, probably much less. The crime rates are so high because  the reoffending rates are so high.  For all the progress of recent decades Alice is still quite a segregated town, with some nice suburbs for the non-indigenous and a lot of poor aboriginal people. In addition, Alice is the only town of any size in central Australia and there is a very transient population of people drifting in and out from the surrounding communities for services. They tend to stay in various  town camps around the town and there is a lot of violence and grog in them. In addition those central Australia remote communities are poor in a way i think most australians cannot comprehend. I used to occasionally visit some of them and i have never seen anything like it. I grew up in the working class north of England and lived for many years in London and i though i knew what poverty looked like but a trip to Yuendumu made me realise i knew nothing of what real poverty is. These places are poor like african villages  are poor, burnt out cars and poorly constructed buildings. They are so remote i would certainly also develop a drinking or drug problem if i had to live there, there is almost literally nothing to do except get drunk or high. I felt like i had fell off the map.  You are correct that the common thread here is poverty. The reasons for that poverty are intergenerational, multi faceted and very very complicated, but it does not change the fact that the anti social behaviour and crime in Alice Springs is predominantly, almost exclusively committed by aboriginal people. This needs to be acknowledged in the first instance before anything can be done. If you were in Geelong or Canberra or Newcastle  or a hundred other towns in Australia it would not be the case, but in Alice Springs it is"

Property crime is definitely a major concern, but cross-racial violence is pretty low, and murder/maiming is extremely rare. Most of the violence is domestic, and not against strangers/tourists. The biggest concern for tourists is having your vehicle broken into, windows smashed, etc.  The cause of this crime is pretty basic. This a remote town, without any major industry. Tourism is dying thanks to Uluru having its own airport, a bad reputation dissuading inter-state travelers, and a growing lack of interest in local activities. Whenever you have poverty, lack of opportunities, and subpar social programs, crime will always be high. There are also fundamental differences in indigenous culture and ""Westernized"" culture, which contributes to the social unrest.  The primary reason Alice Springs makes the news is because of its unique social/racial dynamics which often become the basis for political rhetoric. Liberals blame Labor for being too soft on indigenous offenders, Labor blames the Liberals for lack of support for social programs etc. It is also an internationally recognized location, so it is a convenient topic if you want to garner some quick attention.  I have lived here for four years without major issues and rarely feel unsafe, but I also come from a city with prevalent gun violence and a much higher murder rate.

1e8z06y,leb06ki,AskAnAustralian,Best-Brilliant3314,1721606165.0,"Central Australia has a number of tiny little settlements of Indigenous communities. These communities have undergone a fair amount of generational trauma with the breakdown of traditional tribal structures as previously migratory groups settled in a single place and successive governments have alternately tried to destroy, assimilate, coddle and punish these groups over the last hundred years.   They remain aware of but separate from the standard Trainspotting monologue that guides mainstream society. Most of these communities also have mobile phone coverage so people can see exactly what they don‚Äôt have but, being a small population in a small country, there is next to no online representation of their situation. The worst damage has been the introduction of alcohol and recreational drugs which people have wholeheartedly latched onto as an escape from monotony and misery.   With birth rates rising and infant mortality falling, there‚Äôs been an expansion of the younger demographics but, because many of the older community members are wasting away on alcohol, these youths lack leadership and role models so they form gangs to, essentially, entertain each other. Bad ideas enter these groups, rattle around and escalate in the way that teens try to outdo each other. For occasional big events - such as the local Show (county fair) or a visiting national football game - these groups come to Alice Springs which at 20,000 people is the biggest city within a thousand kilometres.   The groups often have beef - real, imagined or even based on tribal history- and use these opportunities to settle scores. All the good things in Alice Springs costs money which these groups do not have, so they steal, often with an accompanying threat of violence because, well, that‚Äôs what works. The one thing that is free is adrenaline so there‚Äôs also a lot of risk-taking like stealing cars and being chased by the police, which often ends in a fatal crash.   On the up-side, they don‚Äôt use guns but knives are becoming more prominent.

In this context, a lot of Indigenous youth, especially in places like Alice Springs, have been impacted by suicide of family members or friends. Imagine the impact that has on a developing mind.   The Uluru Statement from the Heart goes into great detail about the pervasive issues impacting First Nations communities and made strong recommendations supported by hundreds of Indigenous Elders from across Australia. This included recommending a voice to Parliament and followed by a Treaty to put the development of solutions in the hands of Indigenous communities.

The majority have done well with that and used it to create communities, form businesses and provide for their children.

1hd48l0,m1u2j4u,australian,None,1734081594.0,"Nope. This is a pathetic cop out.  My ancestors were mostly Irish. I also have African ancestors who were enslaved, but that‚Äôs a whole separate topic.  The Irish were the first to be colonised by Britain, and they were subjugated by the British Monarchy and the British Empire for over 800 years.   I have ancestors who were murdered, raped, wrongly imprisoned, tortured, enslaved and exiled, simply for being Irish. Their land, culture and language were stolen from them, to the point where Gaelic is now considered a ‚Äúdead language‚Äù.  Britain has never even acknowledged the utter hell they subjected the Irish to, let alone apologised or issued any sort of reparations, despite their tyrannical reign only officially ending in 1998 (except Northern Ireland remains largely in shambles from ‚ÄúThe Troubles‚Äù and is *still* under British occupation).  My family, among millions of others, had endured over 700 years worth of ‚Äúintergenerational trauma‚Äù  and colonisation before the Aboriginals encountered a single European.   My family is still significantly affected by what happened to our ancestors in Ireland.   Britain‚Äôs reign of terror altered Irish people‚Äôs DNA, genetically predisposing the native Irish population and the diaspora to psychiatric illnesses (especially neurotic and anxiety disorders), addiction (primarily alcoholism, which is rampant in Ireland), gastrointestinal issues (due to generations of severe malnutrition), increased cancer risk, and plenty of other horrific diseases.  My great-grandparents were raised by survivors of ‚ÄúThe Great Famine‚Äù, a genocide which the British Empire instigated by poisoning Irish crops and perpetuated by stealing the crops the Irish *did* manage to grow and sending them straight to England.  The Famine Queen (Queen Victoria) and other British aristocrats would stuff their fat faces with Irish-grown crops, while the Irish people starved to death. It‚Äôs worth noting the British people outside of the ruling class didn‚Äôt benefit from this, they were also oppressed and subjugated by Her Royal Lard-ness and her family pole (not tree) of ingrates.  My great-grandparents recalled stories they‚Äôd heard from their parents and grandparents about watching people die in agony from starvation in the streets. The bodies of people they knew and loved were piled up everywhere. Entire villages were wiped out, to make room for British settlers.  My great-grandparents grew up around people who had suffered from nervous breakdowns, because they‚Äôd been surrounded by so much death and suffering, and people who had lifelong physical health problems as a result of chronic starvation and malnutrition.  Hoarding, paranoia, anxiety, anger, depression, neurosis, post-traumatic stress, emotional repression and alcoholism were just a few of the common reactions and traits among the famine survivors, and sadly these were often passed down.   The bodies of several of my ancestors, who were tortured and murdered by the British, were taken to England as ‚Äútrophies‚Äù and they still haven‚Äôt been returned to Ireland.  Ireland has never fully recovered and we‚Äôre all just expected to act like none of this ever happened. Ignorant people constantly undermine our history and label us as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù, despite the fact that the British coined that term and made it abundantly clear that only British people were considered ‚Äúwhite‚Äù.  But guess what? None of what I‚Äôve just listed gives *me* an excuse to be a violent thug. Why on earth would it?  My ancestors fought and survived against the odds, so that their descendants (including me) could have a better life. I‚Äôm not going to spit in their faces by being a degenerate, especially when, comparatively, I live in the kind of luxury they never could‚Äôve dreamed of.   I will never have to worry about having enough food to eat, or whether myself or my family will survive the winter. I won‚Äôt have to watch my children die from starvation in a genocide. I‚Äôm considered a human being under the law and afforded the same rights as my British peers.  I have the freedom to speak whatever languages I want. I have the freedom to practice my religion and embrace my cultural heritage. I don‚Äôt live in constant fear of being exiled, enslaved, raped, tortured, imprisoned or murdered on the whims of British government or monarchy.   King Chucky and his family of nonces have no power over me. They can‚Äôt hurt me in the way their predecessors hurt not just my ancestors, but hundreds of millions of other people‚Äôs ancestors too.  *Billions* of people can play the ‚Äúoppression card‚Äù, for so many reasons. Hell, what the British inflicted upon the Aboriginals in Australia is a footnote in history, compared to the tyranny they inflicted elsewhere.

Edit/update: Sussan Ley has provided data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (ah, now it is okay to ""trust the bureaucrats"" on this issue, after Dutton critisised a reporter for asking for evidence) showing that child sexual abuse is indeed much higher in Alice Springs than the national average.  Here is the thing - the numbers she is quoting from ARE FROM 2021. At this point, the Alcohol restrictions were still in place, general crime stats had been rising since 2020, and more critically, PETER DUTTON AND SUSSAN LEY WERE LITERALLY RUNNING THE COUNTRY AT THE TIME.

It's a logical theorem that suggests that when you're confronted with two (or more) conflicting reports, the one that requires the *least* stretch of the imagination is the one that is most likely to be true. So here we've got a case of it either being:  1. Dutton is inventing anecdotal evidence to make a political point. 2. There is a conspiracy to cover up police inaction, which would require multiple senior politicians and police members to be some combination of grossly incompetent, incredibly negligent or outright malicious in their actions.  Taken on balance, the first is far more likely than the second because despite supposedly having knowledge of this sexual abuse, Dutton hasn't actually reported it. And while he might not be a mandatory reporter, the fact that he chose to make vague references in a press conference rather than provide specific details to police speaks volumes -- even before you consider that Dutton is a former police officer and would be familiar with this process. Secondly, there hasn't been a single conscientious objector to come forward and either verify Dutton's claims about the extent of sexual abuse or some kind of conspiracy in the rank-and-file of police.  This reeks of Dutton trying to ride the coat-tails of that woman who reported widespread sexual abuse in Alice Springs a few weeks ago. She was presented to the public as a nurse; the strong implication was that she was a registered nurse, but it soon emerged that she was not and that she was far less involved in the process than first suggested. This is exactly what QAnon did with the ""Save the Childen"" movement. They realised very early on that protecting children is an issue that the overwhelming majority of people would support, so they used it as a Trojan horse for their own conspiratorial views."

They‚Äôre the end result of decades of selling off housing commission, the closure of half way and emergency housing by both CLP and NT ALP governments since 2010, and the end of support of major community outreach programs like Blue Light Discos.  Less houses for people to live in, removal of the places you could go to avoid a bad home environment for the night, and removal of activities that provided a positive connection between disadvantaged youths and the police as a means of support.   The place has been downhill since Paul Henderson.  I‚Äôve been saying it since 2016 NT ALP and CLP have the exact same philosophy on how to deal with problem youths, but they only disagree on one bit, the size of the stick to use.    The house next door to me in Katherine used to be a half way house for youth, 9 beds, tutors, counsellors, consoles, access to books, sports in backyard, bus to drop off at school Funding got cut and it was sold, in a 5 year period 7 houses like that were sold.   The house my parents bought in 2001 was ex housing commission, part of 40 sold in a three year period, mid 2010s an apartment complex of 35 2-3 bedroom housing commission townhouses were sold to a private developer after 8 of them suffered fire damage.   Two 10 unit housing commission complexes also sold between 2000-2020.  That‚Äôs just the ones I noticed, how many new housing commission buildings in that time frame? Two vacant blocks currently set aside for eventual development and a 6 unit 1 bedroom complex set aside exclusively for disabled residents.

And the biggest problems were DV and youths running rampant.  I spoke with a probationary cop who'd been in the force only four months and in that time she'd already spiked three cars driven by youths.  They all supported the use of spit hoods because spitting is all but guaranteed.  One thing that really surprised me is that they noticed that once the youths turned 17-18 they all but ceased becoming brats because they knew they'd be held accountable for their actions.  One good thing the cops said was that because of all the crime, the pay was really good and there was no shortage of overtime with most cops pulling in over $150K a year in Alice with all the OT and allowances."
10qli8y,j6u9brr,AskAnAustralian,None,1675291459.0,I've only ever been once. Was travelling around Australia with mates and stopped in at Alice Springs. There was a burnt out van directly out the front of the hostel/backpackers. We walked to a bottle shop at about 8-9pm through a open mall type thing and there were a group of kids there who immediately hurled abuse. First time i've been called a white cunt. Luckily we're all fairly large guys and don't look like a easy target. Also got hassled out for food at the KFC when leaving the next day. Can't say it felt particularly safe.

Please do not misinterpret what I am saying as me denying there is a problem. There 100% is. But the people of this town are not pulling together to try and solve it. And this problem can not be solved by one organisation and it can not be solved overnight. It will have to be a joint effort and it will take a life time. It is so much more complex then just youth crime.   Alice Springs at it's core is truly beautiful. The landscape is stunning. The people are friendly, the culture is rich and there is such a strong spirit among those of us who call it home. You can always count on the community coming together to support you if you find yourself in a rough patch.   I also want to say that there are SO MANY wonderful local aboriginal people who are also worried and mourning and feel a great sense of shame. Do not let what you see paint your opinion of them as a whole group. There is a minority who are ruining it for everyone else.   There are those online who will talk about how many of us are leaving this town.... there are also a huge group of us who refuse to leave as we care deeply and want stay and work to help this lovely place.  I don't think I can fully explain the love I have for Alice but when I first stepped foot in the NT as a kid I knew I would live in the NT once I grew up and when I moved to Alice 7 years ago I immediately knew I had found my home.

A lot of them have grown up in broken homes witnessing violence and drug and alcohol abuse. Many of their parents are in and out of jail. We have the largest indigenous population behind bars.

The issues facing Alice Springs, as well as the NT as a whole, are incredibly complex and will not be solved by the restrictions on alcohol alone. These problems have existed for as long as I have lived here (I‚Äôm almost 30) and if you speak to any Territorian, they are progressively getting worse.   Crime/antisocial behaviour/public drunkenness is so prevalent in public spaces, complacency and desensitisation by onlookers to incidents (that can sometimes occur right in front of them) is sadly quite common.   Unfortunately, the people that cause this antisocial behaviour have the result of generations neglect and failed policies by their own governments and sadly, their own people at times. Some of the stories that have arisen in the media of recent times are heartbreakingly real and are the daily lives of people in a ‚Äúfirst world country‚Äù.   How do you fix this?  There is no simple/easy solution or answer - rather it WILL take all levels of Governments (local, state and federal - hell, even chuck the Opposition into this) working with First Nations Leader/s and NGOs to come up with a plan that is lead and managed by their own people. It‚Äôs easy to say this, but so so so hard to even begin this process. Education, health, housing, safety - these are basic human needs that are either severely lacking or even non existent for some.   I love the NT - it is breathtaking beautiful and the lifestyle is truely unique (there is nowhere else like it in our country) but it‚Äôs changing and not for the better. I do not want to raise my children here long term and it‚Äôs sad to think that they may not have some of the experiences I got to have growing up here."

What people need to understand is that alcohol is a symptom of the problem not the cause - despite many high profile people declaring otherwise.   The real issue is that over the last 15 years the federal and territory governments have reduced funding for services and programs in Alice Springs and communities to the point where there is no support.   They blame alcohol because it‚Äôs an easy sell. But the reality is people drink to escape their suffering and if their life wasn‚Äôt so shit they wouldn‚Äôt drink.

Uluru is the tourism equivalent of a stripper - in which you can only look from a distance and touching is a crime. (Still welcome to pay money though!)  A lot of their major population centers are some of the most crime-afflicted in the country and occasionally the world . (Alice Springs was briefly 17th or so globally, and Tennant Creek is nationally famous for how awful and unsafe it is.)  It's a hot take but I don't know why we keep letting the NT suck up money and then sook when nothing works.  The money should be diverted to build social housing and infrastructure in states that pull their own weight and desperately need the accommodation.  Either that, or we get a federal intervention as every successive state government appears to be useless.  The NT is some kind of Rube Goldberg Machine in which federal funding is input and crime, red sand and inflammatory news articles are the output.  Darwin is basically the exception to all of this, as we needed somewhere to be the capital.

There are no winners. It is one of the worst things about the human race. There is no 'nice way' of dealing with it IMO. Restorative justice does often result in better victim satisfaction per one of the sources I posted above, but you can't un-stab somebody, and you can't un-burn down someone's house. It's about a least-worst approach. There are always going to be people who are irredeemable, who commit acts of cruelty with no remorse, and yeah, lock them up for life AFAIC so we can study them and identify them at birth.  I like to think that most crimes are committed by good people who have had hard lives or made bad choices and that the overwhelming majority of criminals can be saved. The hard pill to swallow is that maybe a victim's personal sense of revenge or justice isn't really that relevant. That is not something I say lightly. I don't think most of us, deep down, really want to inflict suffering on another human being, even one who has wronged us. I think most victims of crime feel the way I felt. Just really sad, and frustrated, and really wanting to make sure it didn't happen again. I don't think I ever really thought 'I hope they torture the bastard' or anything like that.

They recognise that not everyone understands their struggle or their pride in who they are, including other Aboriginal people in Alice Springs. They say people are always looking at what is wrong with Town Camps and fail to see the strength and bonds that have been forged through years of struggle. They say they struggled for years to create their living spaces, through gaining leases and forming Housing Associations under the Tangentyere umbrella, and to maintain their control over how these Town Camps were run. They tell us that a report just prior to the Intervention assessed them against 10 standards that had been established as benchmarks of housing performance. They say they scored above the National average on 7 of these and were at the average on one and only failed to meet these benchmarks on two. They say they can‚Äôt understand the logic of, in their words, ‚Äúcollapsing a successful housing management program‚Äù and replacing it with a system that has not produced anywhere near the same outcomes over the past 10 years.  >In their view, all the current difficulties are a direct result of the Federal Government decision to remove their control over the leases as part of the Emergency Response (the Intervention). They say this meant that their previous slow, but gradual growth in managing their living spaces, was removed for a political decision that has not benefited them in any way. Prior to the forced relinquishment of their leases to the Commonwealth, they say they managed difficult residents, using trespass notices. The process was that the relevant housing association would come together, usually with the tenant, and see if it was possible for them to change their behaviour. If the tenant was willing to make changes, no eviction. If the tenant was unable to change they made a collective decision, and the offending tenant was issued with a trespass notice. The Town Campers say it worked well.  https://tfhc.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/452564/Town-Camps-report_F_Section_Town-camps_Part-D.pdf"

Naturally they plan everything from Canberra because consulting the actual people who live there would clearly be even more insane. So they spend money on programs that achieve sweet bugger all, then say ""Oh well we tried"" and go back to just pretending not to see their fellow Australians living in third world conditions. * I am going to be downvoted to hell by people desperately not trying to say ""Well the actual problem is that all Aboriginals are some combination of child molesters>drunks and druggies>intellectually inferior>lazy>parasites here (while carefully trying to avoid using those exact words, usually)."

Mt Conner viewed from around 50 klm above, will display this the easiest to understand. Also the popular opinion from ‚ÄúThe Experts‚Äù is that the caves at the base of Ulu·πüu was caused from millions of years of water erosion as there was a inland sea at some stage backed up by fish fossils being found. However, if you follow the thought bubble of water erosion, you also have to believe that the water erosion was very disciplined as the Caves are so evenly spaced apart & of pretty much the same size. Also inside the caves, on the ceiling there are formations which the Experts say was caused by millions of years of water dripping down & calcification. However when I first saw them I immediately recognised them as a backbone. I guess 50 years ago some Expert came up with the water calcification thing and it stuck.

1bxow2u,kyez8vz,australia,TerryTowelTogs,1712457660.0,"Great synopsis! Your comment about similar moves from country to city being indicative of wider changes has always rattled around in the back of my mind. I used to live in a small country town in the early 1990s, pop. ~500 in winter, then temporarily the tourists would boost the town to ~20,000 over summer. When housing and cost of living was relatively cheap my small country town was a low income inhabitant haven plus sea change families. Pot was pretty common and there was the very occasional social issue with someone not coping and losing their shit. But that all slowly changed with basic necessity price rises and suddenly more attractive financial options for property investment pushing many of the poorer permanent population out and cutting down on most opportunities for young folk just starting out in life. With the decrease in the quality of life for locals there appeared to be an increase in harder drugs and more antisocial behaviours. Plus the council got overrun by developers changing the whole cultural direction of the town, and the whole vibe of the town changed, delicate ecologies that attracted tourism were flattened and built on, and gentrification totally changed the local socioeconomic demographics. Turning it into essentially a summer time suburb for rich Sydney and Canberra folk who owned or could afford to rent a house, with very little off season culture compared to historically. And whenever I look into the changes happening in outback towns, and the similar time frames their changes have been occurring. It gets me wondering if the forces driving these increasingly undesirable social changes are a nation wide phenomena? And that vulnerable places like Alice Springs, or to a lesser extent the country town I used to live in, aren‚Äôt just the canaries in the coal mine for wider societal issues that are a consequence of the previous forty years of legislated changes, and political populism and perceived social priorities? My gut instinct is that whatever sociopolitical direction that would increase the viability of life in rural, remote and country towns, would also benefit communities like Alice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è hope that wasn‚Äôt too incoherent."
1bxow2u,kyffw6h,australia,HaXxorIzed,1712465804.0,"Another component that I think many people who lack local knowledge/experience of the Northern Territory's situation is how distance and isolation slow down + over-cost any response the government can take to achieve some of the constructive responses to problems you have highlighted. This is something that comes up a lot in the GST discussions over at the [Commonwealth Grants Commission](https://www.cgc.gov.au/) ([Indigeneity + distance](https://www.cgc.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-03/NT%20submission%20-%20Tranche%202_2025R.pdf) being factors that massively push up cost of providing government services) and is worth reading if you want to learn more about how hard these problems are to tackle.  In 2022, [a third of houses were burned down in Wadeye](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-27/wadeye-port-keats-northern-territory-fighting/101018246) - which uprooted many people who were living there, and lead to the regions they moved to being under increasing stress. In a southern state with a larger population and where a town the size of Wadeye is both more common and typically a lot closer to other towns or cities, that's something you can take action to recover and address more quickly, cheaply and with a lot more trained people ""on-hand"".  But for the NT government (which has less resources, funding and simply capable people - given its size), that's so much harder to do. Remote communities in the tropics are resource-stressed for many reasons; and if a major disruption or damage hits one, it can start a line of knock-on domino effects that are tinder to a matchbox. This is especially important because so many of the problems in the NT are intergenerational violence and abuse - and things like[ Covid made that worse](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajs4.183).  And to be clear, I'm not saying that this is all covid's fault, or that it's all events like Wadeye's burning houses to blame. Rather, I'm hoping to get across that compared to other parts of Australia (many experiencing problems with youth crime and inter generational poverty!), the NT and places like Alice Springs are uniquely *fragile* to one or two big disruptions starting a snowball of worsening outcomes in those problems, and that's exactly what we have seen. That compounds the fact that the last time we had ""unity"" in attempt to do something (the Intervention), it was ineffective, motivated by [lies](https://newmatilda.com/2017/06/23/bad-aunty-seven-years-how-abc-lateline-sparked-racist-nt-intervention/) and did [real damage](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/148959) to the [*belief* and *trust*](https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/2106156/NT-Intervention-Evaluation-Report-2020.pdf) many people had in the federal government's ability to help.  Which leaves us with Alice Springs where it is now: An absolute mess that will require not just money but a united, long-term commitment by government (and specialised resources beyond just money: skilled people, experts, policing and rehabilitation) - which we are unlikely to get. Nobody wants to think further than the next election cycle on this problem, and even if you see a brief moment of unity from state/federal/local governments it comes unstuck just as fast. That kills trust, and without trust in the system, even young kids in communities who might believe they have a future are going to (fairly ask): who's got their back trying to chase it?"

But I do not like or respect aboriginals. To answer your question on why.  - they consistently take from the system. Grants, money, welfare, all from taxpayers. Yes, they were mistreated severely years ago. But as a migrant to this country, that wasn't me nor my family. Why should I have to pay for the mistakes of British settlers.  - they have every advantage in every aspect of everything. They can hunt any animal they want, they get preference treatment in jobs, in schools, universities, medical facilities, they can enter national parks for free and kill protected animals. They have their own court and some laws don't even apply to them?  - they're more violent and criminal than the rest of society. Look at the crime rates of aboriginals. It's ludicrous. How do we just accept what they do in Alice Springs?  - every encounter I've had with an aboriginal is negative. As a teenager they were anti social and violent. As an adult they have screwed me when I allowed them to rent my house and caused thousands in damage.  - they are constantly looking for handouts. They've figured out the system is virtue signalling and are fully playing into it for the advantages they recieve.  - welcome to country at every. single. Opportunity. Is this necessary? To be forced to sit through a welcome to country all the time? Its ridiculous. At the right times it's a beautiful thing. My partner got a citizenship and they did one at the ceremony, it was done by an aboriginal who did some traditional dances and stuff and it felt right. It doesn't feel right when Karen from HR does a welcome to country every time a meeting is held.  - white people seem to continuously push this agenda, if you feel obliged to help aboriginals Go and volunteer or sacrifice your own income to help them. Don't drag others into it. Being forced to embrace something you don't really believe in causes resentment.  - most of the people in Australia have done nothing to aboriginals and owe them nothing ! This is becoming a greater % as immigration. I get that the British descendants may want to pay reparations in the form of welfare to aboriginals. But this is not the responsibility of the immigrant to funnel our tax dollars into this cause.  Ultimately I do not care about aboriginals as long as they don't take my tax dollars for anything and don't commit crimes against me and don't get special laws made just for them."

The Australian government's just taken a backseat and refuses to get involved in the fears of being seen  in the same light as the same apartheid freaks that ran the Australian government. I remember reading an article where an Indigenous elder was in support of completely banning alcohol altogether around Alice Springs, but the government was like 'Nah we'll look genocidal.'   Indigenous cultural values also differ vastly from Australian expectations. There needs to be a reconciliation. Young Indigenous boys aged 12 drop out of hogh school because they become 'men'. Again, no offense to them but I'm Muslim - we technically become men once we hit puberty or we reach the age of 15. Same thing applies with Judaism, but 99% of us reconciled it with the Australian rule of law that states a person reaches legal adulthood when they turn 18. Something has to give.

The exact opposite actually, Any investigation should rely on facts and not sensationalism.  >I understand that perhaps the numbers are over sensationalised and  ""racists"" misinterpret and  exaggerate the numbers for their own agenda. The discrepancies are still pretty bad. As per the health index.   I said the discrepancies are bad. But over exaggeration does no help.  >Also its abit odd that even if its teenagers having sex amongst themselves, where did the STIs come from. To my understanding, only a few are transmitted through birth  This is really interesting if you research it. The current syphilis outbreak for example  in the NT can all be traved to one index case from Queensland. This person had sex with some from the the Alice Springs area approx 15 years ago. When you look at the charts and spread over that time, the syphilis outbreak literally spreads from Alice Springs upwards through the Territory jumping from community to community. One person visiting Alice Springs for example takes it back to their community and suddenly its a cluster in that community. When you see the charts you there's like a outbreak in Tennant Creek a few years after Alice, then Katherine a few years after, the Darwin a few after that. It literally snakes up the stuart highway. The Darwin strain then become penicillin resistant making things even harder. And finally from Darwin and Katherine it spread out to Arnhem land.  As for how it's spread amongst teenagers? teenagers fuck my dude. The age group of 15-24 is very active. And one 24 year old has sex with a 21 year old, that 21 year old has sex with an 18 year old, that 18 year old has sex with a 16 year old, and then suddenly there's huge spread amongst the 15-16 year olds. Part of my job is doing the contact tracing and its quite interesting seeing the circles develop, and how it takes just one person from the 18 year old circle hookup with  someone from the 16 year old circles for both circles to become infected."

1h2hrtg,lzjbo8b,OldPhotosInRealLife,twosharprabbitteeth,1732871418.0,"The Northern Territory of Australia's archives online has this photo in the Smith Collection, under 'Aboriginal Peoples' (Australian)¬† with no further info. [https://hdl.handle.net/10070/721715](https://hdl.handle.net/10070/721715)    What I see, is the hills south of the Alice Springs Telegraph Station, a housegirl I know to be Dolly on the right, and a Telegraph Pole in the background...¬†    Could be a Frank Gillen Photo or a Thomas Bradshaw photo. I am leaning towards Frank Gillen, because he was very friendly with the Arrernte, and Dolly (on the right) was his favourite. He made heaps of photos with Dolly in it. He also bothered her for nude photos but his wife had instilled a firm Christian 'no' to that...    That didn't stop him because I have seen her in several nude photos in the guise of 'typical native' anthropological photos.    Anyway, the 'tells' that show me where this might be, were/are difficult to see...    The only way to find this was to take photos home¬† and study them on the computer, to look for rocks that might match.    To get to the right place I just follow vertical lines in the photo until they converge at the camera.    The Telegraph pole in the picture puts the date at after April 1899. In relocating the line here with an extra copper wire was the last thing Frank Gillen did, before handing over to his replacement, Stationmaster Thomas Bradshaw.    Thomas Bradshaw initially tried to avoid the role of 'Protector of Aboriginals' and tried to palm it off to the local Mounted Constable. Gillen was rope-able, because¬† hew reckoned the policeman was always either drunk or recovering from being drunk. Gillen therefore thought good relations would go downhill, hence Bradshaw taking photos of Arrernte in their camp seems less likely. More likely Gillen took photos of his Arrernte friends before he left.    Dolly was taken over by Bradshaw as housegirl (nanny housemaid), but the Bradshaws soon 'let her go', whereas Gillen's photos of Dolly smack of infatuation.  I spotted stripy jumpers on jockeys at the racecourse and that makes sense. Frank Gillen is Stipendary Magistrate and president of the region‚Äôs turf club. The region is about the size of France and only has a few hundred white people in it. He probably bought the jumpers for the club so they ended up at the Telegraph Station. The housegirls were not paid but did receive goods in lieu of payment‚Ä¶    By finding the correct location we can also learn that the women‚Äôs camp was right alongside the Main North Road. The Telegraph Track from Adelaide to Port Darwin. The occasional traveler became a stream of miners around 1904 when gold was found at Winnecke goldfields.    The open area beside the track here was also a camp arra used by travelers and the Cameleers with their 60or so camels of the supply ‚Äòcamel trains‚Äô.    The camel smell upset the horses and cattle kept at the Station yards, and therefore had to stay some distance away.    Camping near the women appeared to be a mutually agreeable arrangement‚Ä¶  Cameleers also hawked or traded knickknacks, tobacco, pipes, scarves and haberdashery.    So every time I find an old photo location I learn something new."

10k0vuv,j5oko3c,AustralianPolitics,lost89577,1674569221.0,Well i can tell you after the sorry statement. A lot of Alice springs local Aboriginals we're excited about getting a payout from the government. Not better services as they already get that now.
10k0vuv,j5o815l,AustralianPolitics,EASY_EEVEE,1674562432.0,">The fact is aboriginal culture as unique and deep as it is, is from another time, we don't cling to our neolithic, or even medieval European or Asian cultures  What do you think most abrahamic religions do? They preserve 2 thousand year old fairy tales, and is a direct cause for so much modern misery it's insane.   Sure i think tradition needs to die. But even here in Geelong, there is a massive poverty problem. If there's a poverty problem so ingrained in Geelong, i can only imagine Alice Springs.   Hell Sunshine, who here's been to Sunshine?   It's literally where the sun doesn't shine. That's got a massive Vietnamese and Sudanese community, and the place probably 10 years ago, looked like a actual warzone.   Burnt cars on the sides of roads, trash everywhere, shops smashed in, constant stabbings and murders, gunshots and gang fights not different from Corio and Norlane. In Australia.   Commission areas often get hard ignored. And NIMBYs often cement these areas to never being developed past housing commissions.   These are inner city areas too."

10k0vuv,j5s6myr,AustralianPolitics,Full_Distribution874,1674621173.0,"I don't think it ""brought the crazies out"", but when you poke shit the flies swam. These remote communities have never been nice, the effects of alcohol and many other social and economic factors have always been around. Alice Springs banning alcohol is far from unprecedented, there are heaps of dry communities out there (they're much nicer too, anecdotally).   The problem is that the debate about the voice is about these issues. More Aboriginal people live in SEQ than the NT, but because that's normal suburbia, it doesn't make a good story. Remote Australia is like a different country. Poor education, intermittent (to put it generously) services and no opportunities. It is actually shocking to see coming from a coastal city. Visibly pregnant teenagers, barred windows on every shop, intoxicated people at 9am etc...  It's scary. Alien and scary. Xenophobia of what lies within our borders. Now this could go either way for the voice, the shame could make some people vote for or the fear some people against. But either way this is a problem with regional Australia, not Aboriginal people."

So the intervention was banning all alcohol with Alice Springs + other regions?  But then the NT's own legislation isn't going as far?"
