xnieij,iptqxvf,pics,BeepBoopWhat2,1664103667.0,True. We respected the traditional owners at Uluṟu and Kata Tjuta. We did the same here (Karlu Karlu) and didn’t walk over the rock formations. My 7 yr old held himself back quite well except for this moment for the photo (I didn’t prompt him to do this).

I don't see how he could not be prosecuted"
6a4bnu,dhcqlio,australia,calamariring,1494375640.0,"why wouldn't i believe you? i said some cultures are more equal than others, not always justifiably (caste systems deserve to be disregarded).   From what i heard about the devils marbles is that in local legend the devils marbles and Uluru seeded planet earth. Dunno if the story is the same across all tribes. But obviously it's very important to them and now some dickhead went and took a shit on them"
