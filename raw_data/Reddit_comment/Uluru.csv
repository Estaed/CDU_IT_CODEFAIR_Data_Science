We did this and it started out fine, but sadly the sky was cloudy and the ‚Äúsky-talker‚Äù couldn‚Äôt talk about anything relevant. The food was mediocre and as it was served buffet style in the open air, it was pretty much cold by the time our table was called up. It got dark and they put these little electric candles on every table (couldn‚Äôt see our food without them), but they attracted SO MANY FLYING INSECTS. It was kind of gross, they kept ending up on the plate. Overall, not a good experience.   What we DID really enjoy was the bus tour to see the sunrise over Uluru, a beautiful sunrise hike at Kata Tjuta and a nice sunset viewing (we had a rental car and self-drove), and we rented bikes and rode all around the base of Uluru one morning. (It was really hot and we found this a bit more appealing than walking for 2+ hours in the sun. We took frequent breaks and loads of pictures.)  We stayed at the Lost Camel and we really enjoyed having the pool - although there is limited shady seats/loungers.   In case you‚Äôre not aware - everything is owned by one company - all the accommodation, campsite, shops, etc., as well as all the activities. So you can‚Äôt really shop around for a better deal or anything like that.

(2) Whatever you do, set aside a full day and take your time to slowly and gently walk around Uluru to absorb the amazing tranquility and its unique ""spirit of place"" (for want of a better phrase). Once you're in the National Park, its free to walk around the entire circumference, and highly recommended if physically possible (its all flat pathways - no hills, no stairs). Every section, you'll discover something new and amazing. (On the other hand, if you're the sort of person that thinks a Segway would be a great way to experience the Taj Mahal, then book a Segway tour.)  (3) Dont skip heading over to Kata Tjuta. Its just as amazing as Uluru."
1lypgb3,n9ad03y,AustraliaTravel,DesiGora,1755486226.0,"Almost all of the excursions are overpriced and wine focused.  The drone and light shows, IMO, are more about manmade art where the magical desert is just the backdrop, of which you can't see anything because it's dark.  It's a waste of time and money.  You can do EVERYTHING by yourself.  The hop on hop off bus is EXPENSIVE, better off renting 2 cars.  Get the fly nets.  Hike around Uluru base, it's about 7 miles.  Hike at Kata Tjuta, it's magical.  If you have a clear night, just drive out 10 minutes and you will have amazing skies, download the stars app on your phone.  Grab cheap food at the IGA grocery store.  Avoid the Kiosk restaurant.  The Gecko restaurant is good and well priced.  Camel excursion is the only one you can't do on your own."

dbqigh,f23z27t,australia,Lorjelx,1569941140.0,"I‚Äôm conflicted on this issue, downvote me all you want. A few years or months ago I thought of the same thing many people think about Uluru, ‚Äúrespect the true owners of the land‚Äù and ‚Äúdisrespectful tourists‚Äù ect. However when I actually visited Uluru from Melbourne for a school excursion earlier this May my whole view changed completely. My tour guide was the best, wise and truthful person (I forgot his name) but anyways he told us that the whole deal of closing down climbing the rock and the signs that say not to were all done by the media to manipulate and misconstrue us, play a narrative that white Australians think they‚Äôre doing the right thing by doing useless things such as closing down Uluru for no reason. He told us the real reason why Indigenous Australians are upset is that Uluru itself is a rock and has no sacred value. What does are certain parts and areas where traditions have been held (such as child birth) they were called ‚Äòsensitive sites‚Äô and were asked not to take photos. The issue is when tourist disrespect these wishes and not respect the area. Our tour guide actually encouraged us to get on the rock (not climb) our teachers were taken back because they were aware beforehand of the situation. The tour guide did tell us it was a good thing they were banning closing it down because of deaths due to the lack of safety and you get the same view of the place on the ground. The trip really opened my eyes and as I said before, I‚Äôm conflicted. You may not believe me but I encourage you if you‚Äôre an Australian to make the trip to Uluru once in your life.   Tdlr: Went to Uluru and found out media manipulates us when Indigenous Australians didn‚Äôt actually care that much about the ban.  Edit: I didn‚Äôt climb Uluru out of respect of the Indigenous Australians and Uluru look way better from a distance anyway."

dbqigh,f23ut4h,australia,TheWololoWombat,1569938176.0,"Confession.  This is not a ‚Äòfriend‚Äôs ‚Äô footage. This is my footage. I climbed Uluru on Sunday. I wanted to spark discussion and hear other‚Äôs P.O.V without the personal attacks clouding how I might receive it.  I‚Äôve climbed to Machu Picchu, Everest Base Camp, St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, the Vatican Dome, The Great Wall of China, The Great Pyramid of Giza (well... as high as I was allowed to go), The Grand Canyon, Santorini and The Burj Khalifa...I could go on...  But for me, as an Australian, I can honestly say climbing Uluru topped them all. Seeing the harsh, red desert as far as the eye can see... the serenity, the remoteness.... the very centre of my country and culture to which I was born.... Most pertinent however was comprehending/reflecting on my insignificance; my short, fragile, mortal life contrasted with the (seemingly) immortal, immutable strength of Uluru....  It was almost a spiritual experience for me (climbing Uluru)... though I recognise irony/hypocrisy in what I‚Äôm about to say, this experience grew my respect and understanding for our indigenous forefathers, who, for 60,000+ years have been stewards of our great land. Caring for it, a part of it... understanding their place in nature, their fragility, their responsibility. As a (third generation) Australian, I too am a part of that responsibility (stewardship)... irrespective of the colour my skin (like that should count for anything!) or even historic ancestry!  I knew just simply waking around it, or taking a helicopter flight would not evoke the same introspection. I needed to climb it. So, as soon as I heard it was closing, like many others, I booked my flight.  I know many will not agree with my subjective, nuanced reasoning to climb... I have (and will be) judged as ‚Äòa selfish shitcunt‚Äô, ‚Äòa deplorable dick head‚Äô or an ‚Äòarrogant asshole‚Äô.  ... But i think the controversy of the Uluru climb is actually an (inappropriate) proxy/scapegoat for the bigger issue in Australia: respecting indigenous culture and making amends for historic injustice and cultural genocide committed at the hands of colonisers... I don‚Äôt think banning the climb is the solution here. I will respect the wishes of the Anangu and never climb again, but I‚Äôm glad I took the opportunity while it was still legal and allowed.  I hope one day the Anangu will decide to guide (the Uluru climb) those who are wanting to learn from Aboriginal culture, so that one day my children can experience the significance of Uluru. Furthermore, I hope that one day all Australians will reach a point of reconciliation and integration with indigenous culture that the colour of our skin or the tally of our Australian ancestors does not determine our ownership/responsibility for our land... but that we are collectively responsible and equally accountable for our Great South Land.    No TLDR - if you want to understand my (subjective) perspective... you need all of it ;)"

People don't go climbing hills and mountains on farms without the permission of the owners.

Of course. Private property itself is political. There is nothing in the physical world that reflects that person X owns area of land Y. The concept of 'ownership' itself is political.

Mt Connor is also big (859 metres above sea level vs 863 for Uluru) and is located nearby.

It‚Äôll be protected under the applicable heritage legislation. So at a state level, that would be the Heritage Act 2011 (iirc). Once the climbing ban is enacted, people could possibly face penalties for not complying with the site protections. So IF the site registration, management plan and resulting protections specifically disallow climbing (or access) in the future, it is a prosecutable offence.   I think some of those penalties can involve jail time, if successfully prosecuted to that level. Part 5.5 of the Heritage Act 2011 that outlines the specifics.   I know that Uluru is UNESCO World Heritage Listed, so there‚Äôs commonwealth regulation / management under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (iirc). But I think that legislation is more intended to establish the management / protection framework than provide grounds for enforcement - that‚Äôs administratively better done at a state level.   Also Uluru is held by the Anangu people in native title. (and maybe other property rights, Northern Territory native title / land rights are not my area of expertise). There is a 99 year lease in place to the Government, which allows the National Park to be managed under statute - which is important from a visitor control and management perspective.  The National Park Board of management can likely take enforcement action against visitors who attempt to climb Uluru after the ban. Might be in the same way that littering and other infractions against the rules of visiting the park are managed - fines and such. These are generally enabled through the legislation and regulations that apply to managing the National Park, which differs state to state.  I personally believe that they‚Äôre starting off softly, and hoping visitors will do the right thing. If the climbing ban isn‚Äôt respected, the management body and the State Government will likely have to look at enforcement mechanisms and decide how to best apply what is available (such as via my above vague description of options)."

They rescued 7,349 people last year - an average of 20 per day in a thinly populated part of the world. It's a very real threat, so take it seriously. Even Bear Grylls cannot survive out there on foot. They dropped him off somewhere much safer for his Australian Man vs Wild episode.  All in all, it's one of the most special places I've been in my life and I can't wait to go back. The touristy guided walk around Uluru is absolutely worth it, you'll hear stories about how people lived there a hundred years ago. Pretty amazing stuff, given how hard it is to survive. It rains about 5 days a year out there half the time it rains even less."

But there are varying tiers of accomodation, with some parts a little cheaper than others. Their restaurants are generally disappointing. But there is a grocery store with the basics.  I did a trip like yours a couple years ago. Loved so much about it. I was very glad I rented a car. Uluru is fantastic. I liked Kata Tju·πØan even more. There is a viewpoint there that is amazingly serene. I did a sunrise tour of Ulu·πüu and Kata Tjuta one morning. The guide was excellent in explaining the amazing geological processes needed to create both structures. Otherwise, I was happy to explore on my own.  In June, prepare for it to get near freezing at night."

There's not a lot of exploring to do. The Olga's just down the road were more interesting, I thought. But again, just some rocks in a desert.

If you are booking accommodation/campsite it goes through ayers rock resort and the website says its complimentary with accommodation.  They meet all flights.  There is a hop on hop off bus that runs. It looks like you can book multi day passes if you want to self guide.

1lfe7sc,myrkr1s,RareHistoricalPhotos,Ariadne_String,1750398916.0,"The clothes in the dingo den were found because a British tourist fell off of Uluru (known as Ayer‚Äôs Rock long ago) and landed near the dingo den several years after Azaria was snatched, while her mother languished in prison.  They found the den and ultimately Baby Azaria‚Äôs clothes when retrieving the tourist‚Äôs body.  The whole ‚ÄúA dingo took my baby!‚Äù event was very revealing and unfortunate.  It showed the vicious mentality of the general public and the media.  Baby Azaria‚Äôs mother was convicted in the court of public opinion long before she was convicted in a court of law, with significant help from the media and law enforcement.  As for evidence against the Chamberlains, a chemical that shows blood lit up under the front dash of the car they took to Uluru, but later (AFTER Lindy Chamberlain was convicted) it was revealed that the chemical also lit up for the insulation/sealing product that the car manufacturer sprayed along the body of the car, including under the dash‚Ä¶  But at the time, nobody (except _some_ Aborigines) believed that a dingo would or could steal a human baby and successfully run off with it.  Yet in the years after this happened, there have been a few concrete cases showing very clearly that YES, dingos absolutely CAN, and if desperate/hungry enough, might try to steal a human baby or a toddler.  In one such case, a father had to (successfully) fight off a dingo who was dragging his toddler away‚Ä¶  The movie ‚ÄúA Cry in the Dark‚Äù (titled ‚ÄúEvil Angels‚Äù in Australia) with Meryl Streep and Sam Neill is a great movie about the Baby Azaria case.  It shows how everyone turned against the mother, all because the media fueled the strong belief that a dingo could never, ever, have done what the mother claimed, heh.  Oh, and Meryl did a great job with her fake accent. :)  Of course now we know they were all wrong.  Ultimately, Lindy Chamberlain was released from prison, and all charges were overturned/dropped for her and her husband in 1988, but it took until 2012 for a Northern Territory coroner to finally agree that Baby Azaria was in fact killed by dingos‚Ä¶  And to this day, the phrase Lindy cried out after she saw a dingo run out of the tent with her infant child, is still famous: ‚ÄúA dingo took my baby!‚Äù  And at least now we know it was the actual TRUTH‚Ä¶"

If you're unfamiliar with Australia, know that there's a reason very few people live in the central areas of the continent- it is hot, dry, and harsh.

I have a series of photos taken about 10 minutes apart, it‚Äôs fascinating how the rock changes colour as the sun goes down.   We slept in swags under the stars, which everyone should do at least once in their lives, and just before dawn the next morning we went on a walking tour around the base of Uluru. It probably took a couple of hours. There were a few places that are considered very sacred and you‚Äôre not allowed to film/take photos.   The thing that surprised me was the shape. Everyone‚Äôs seen that classic photo where it kind of looks like a loaf of bread, but close up it‚Äôs a lot more irregular. There are caves and pools of water. Some of the caves have Aboriginal art in them, which might be 100s of years old.

But, it coincides pretty strongly with a major tourism boom from another ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúmainland‚Äù country with the largest population ‚Ä¶ and some tourists being generally awful.  Uluru was being constantly littered with trash and plastic water bottles, as well as human waste (no bathrooms or portapotties on the long climb up).    Additionally, some tourists have died or been seriously injured attempting the climb, and the aboriginals claim this causes them sadness & guilt of responsibility.

7a14gt,dp6lc2w,australia,Cremasterau,1509530180.0,My cousin was a ranger there when we visited. I had given my family the choice of whether they wanted to climb it before we got there even though I had decided not to myself.  After talking to him about the reasons why the local community were not in favour of visitors ascending the rock they also pulled the pin.  Basically it comes down to people being injured or killed while climbing. The locals felt there was a duty of care on them to look after visitors to their land and deemed themselves failing that duty when something happened.  While not explicitly stated the another reason it seems was that they regarded the spirit of those who lost their lives climbing the rock would remain at the site. Indigenous people can be incredibly superstitious and having strangers spirits wandering their place was certainly an uncomfortable thought.  That is not to say they were alone in their superstitions. The mail room contains basket after basket of packages from around the world containing rocks that were taken from Uluru but sent back after visitors later learned it was bad luck to remove them. The rangers could not return them without knowing exactly where they came from so instead they continued to be stored at the center.  In the end we walked the perimeter and we really glad we did. There were a couple of areas out of bounds but some of the permanent water holes and other sites were pretty awe inspiring.  I'm glad the climbing will stop in 2019.  edit: grammar.

They had to agree to lease the land to the government for 99 years, and part of that agreement stipulated that they could close the climb when the proportion of visitors who climbed fell below 20%. Closing the climb has always been part of the plan, they just haven't been able to do it until now - the proportion of visitors who climb is now at 16%.   And to be honest, for most people, just hearing 'the Anangu would prefer you didn't, and this is why' is enough. 84% of visitors to Uluru just hear that request, and respect it. Anangu culture places an emphasis on individual responsibility. They can educate you on why it's a jerk move to climb Uluru, but ultimately, it's up to you to take that information on, to weigh your options, and to take responsibility for your decision."

When people are injured or die we feel sad because we failed in our duty to protect our visitors"".  My personal view is that liberalism should apply. Do whatever you want as long as it doesn't impact others. If you got to a cathedral in Europe as a tourist you'd be welcome to climb the spire or visit the crypts, even if that's not something someone who worships at the cathedral will do. You'd also be welcome to pray or observe a minute's silence. Sometimes they will close the cathedral for worship. Once finished they'll reopen it to tourists.

Australia has countless indigenous and foreign names for places. Eg. Garriwerd/Grampians Kunanyi/My Wellington. And of course the problem with European naming was that it ignored overrode and erased in some cases Indigenous naming and significance. Rightly efforts to rename and reintroduce original indigenous names should continue. But We shouldn't try to override the European names in the same way as it is more important to preserve the story of their names.

For example, arguably at the height of her recent political career, her performance in the 2017 Western Australian and Queensland Election was abysmal. In WA, she got less than 5% of the vote with merely two upper house seats won while in Queensland she got 13% with only 1 seat yielded (this is despite Queensland being the home of her loony party).  In both elections there were massive predictions for her party but they all fell short. Additionally, this can partially be explained by her campaigning. I can't recall the exact details, but I remember she made some embarrassing mistakes in WA when she visited the state that ruined her chances there. Not only that, but in the last federal election she gave a piss-poor terrible sobbing interview with Tracey Grimshaw where she humiliated herself on national television but bursting into tears about how victimised she feels among other such pithy remarks.  Now One Nation has 2 senators from its record of 4 and barely any elected members scattered throughout the country. And we've had her latest embarrassing political stunt, in which a right-wing strong-man (Pauline) is shown shrieking on the side of Uluru complaining that she's scared of slipping off. Instead of enticing voters, I think many of them will just be pissing their pants laughing that such an embarrassing person ever got elected into politics.

There was a gate to pass through before getting too close to Uluru, run by indigenous people, but not Anangu, they were from Sydney! The place was imaculate, that gate fee clearly payed for a lot of cleanup, signs, fencing etc. This was the first time I had even heard about an issue with climbing, other than the physical dangers of course. There were a lot of visitors and if you were going to feel anything spiritual you would probably have to come at midnight when the crowds had died off.  It's become political more than spiritual. A big stone power play. By the way, the view from the top is spectacular. There may be ""nothing"" around, but that's the point. It makes you realise just how unique the rock is. How isolated. The land around you goes on forever and you feel raised up in the middle of nowhere. You will never feel that way in a helicopter or see the same sights with a drone. I regret that my children will never (potentially) experience this unique experience."

On the one hand, I have a great respect for indigenous cultures, and think the shit-show they get from colonizers really does suck, even to this day. And there does need to be some form of natural conservation to ensure ecosystems can continue to function.   But I don't think either of those should extend to blocking people off from experiencing the majesty and beauty of places like Uluru or Bear's Lodge/Devil's Tower, or any other natural wonder.   In this case, I think the Anangu are in the wrong about Uluru. People *should* be allowed to climb, and the Anangu should instead welcome people to make the climb and even consider instructing tourists on their cultural practices within Uluru.   Denying access to anyone is wrong, regardless of the reason. There *has* to be a happy medium."

How many people do they have to be sacred to before we restrict access to them? A hundred, a thousand, a million?   Does it matter for how long they have considered it sacred? Could a group arise tomorrow and declare this, that, or another thing to be sacred?   I think management of natural features must balance the interests of all users, and all of the activities those users want to engage in.  But I'm not mad that climbing Uluru is now forbidden, either.

Uluru is not a ‚Äònatural feature‚Äô that has an inherent economic value like a forest or clay pit. Instead, it‚Äôs value comes its aesthetic power and also its history.   As others have noted, the peak of Uluru is not a stunning viewpoint, so climbing it purely existed to facilitate some desire to climb a rock (a very natural and human obsession) and also give to ‚Äòdo‚Äô at Uluru- there ain‚Äôt much else out there to keep tourists around.   So while I agree with your premise that the Earth should be managed with consideration. However, I feel the wants of outsiders are greatly less important than the wants of people who live there.

And why climb it, a place that thousands of people climb yearly?   Also a big part of the philosophy of explorers is respecting the land. Any true explorer respects local cultures and customs, and the land that they explore, as to preserve it for future generations to enjoy. Its very selfish to just want to climb where you want and damage where you want in the name of 'exploration' and its spitting in the face of every true explorer. Uluru is perfectly mapped as is due to satellites and as I said you can gain a much better view from down below as you cant really see it when standing atop it, so theres not much to 'explore' up top.  While I agree that I don't think man should have claim over land as land belongs to everyone, I dont think that means you should be able to just be disrespectful to people's culture. The locals to every sacred place have no legal ownership of the land and won't force you off it, so you can go if you want, but you are heavoly disrespecting them by doing so. If its an accident then they'll let you off, if its intentional then you're a dick and thats it really.   You sound like the typical 13 year old edgy athiest and its really tiring, it makes me embarrassed to call myself an athiest. Just because I dont believe in gods doesn't mean other people are stupid for believing in them. People can believe in what they want, its a free world, and I only have an issue if their beliefs encroach on my freedoms which is only an issue very infrequently. Theres a difference betweeb choosing to not believe in something, and then being mean to everyone else who does believe in something.

I agree that everyone has a different level of what is disrespectful. But that doesn't mean that your description of what is and isn't disrespectful is always right. You may not think that it is disrespectful to climb Uluru, but the natives do. And since you are in their native lands and are actively disrespecting them by climbing their sacred places, then they have the authority to declare that disrespectful. Nobody is saying that you have to believe in their gods and hold that specific rock sacred to yourself, just that you respect those who's ancestry and culture traces back millenia to that rock. You can only decide on what is disrespectful to yourself, not what is disrespectful to others. And then from there you can decide whether or not you will disrespect someone.

An analogue would be if the Hawaiian islands were instead called 'Cook Islands', or if Crimea was now renamed to Putinania.

The reason I was so wrong about my preconception of Uluru personally, is because photos taken of it have to be done wayyyy further in the distance than you expect or can even really tell given the perspective of the terrain. What makes the place special is not really that it's so huge in comparison to world natural formations, but just that it's so huge and imposing in the particular place and way that it is.

172krtq,k3xrcby,australia,notfinch,1696731822.0,"I was there last year. The resort is nothing like what I remember from a prior visit about 15 years ago:  - There's a focus on high-end experiences with high-end prices. That's fine, but it wouldn't hurt to maintain the cheaper accommodation or the campground a bit better. Everything was run down and tired, and in need of more maintenance than just a lick of paint or some watering of the grass to make it look and feel like a nice place. - There are no staff. When I was there, the petrol station was open during limited hours because the staff had other jobs cleaning rooms or running tours. Not great for the road-tripping contingent. - Everything takes forever. See above - there are no staff. Check-in, paying for fuel, getting a meal. Be prepared to wait. My Calipo melted between picking it out of the freezer and paying for it at the counter. - There is no competition and no incentive to do better - either in terms of services, prices, or amenities. - There was a weird approach to alcohol. You can't just go to a bar or restaurant and buy a beer. You need a ticket or a voucher to do so. I don't know exactly how it worked (are there per-person consumption limits?) because I didn't have alcohol with my meal, but it's not conducive to a smooth or welcoming tourist experience. - The cultural experiences are great. Expensive but great. Limited opening hours made it difficult to fit everything into a reasonable timeframe.  As an aside, a friend lived and worked there as a pilot. Living conditions and ""perks"" to keep him there were slowly eroded once GPT sold the resort to the Indigenous Land Corporation. He left and now flies for an airline in Asia.  Would I go back? Sure, I will, but I hope things improve a lot before then. It's not a good way to represent one of our more iconic natural wonders.  My experience gels with what I had heard about it in the leadup to my (somewhat accidental - we weren't planning to be within about 500km of Uluru) trip but it was a surprise to see it for myself. I suspect the word is out that it's expensive and poor value."

At the exact antipode of the impact site there are a series of hills and ridges that many scientists believe were created by the shockwaves of the impact circling the globe and converging together.   https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975Moon...12..159S/abstract  That being said, the ridges are on the order of 10m tall (still significant for how smooth Mercury is) so these are 35x smaller than Uluru. If we assume that the ridge size is proportional to impact energy, you would need 35x more energy than the 2x10^27 joules that created the Caloris crater, so 7x10^28 joules. The meteor that formed the Yucat√°n crater and wiped out the dinosaurs was only 7x10^19 joules, so you‚Äôd need a meteor 1,000,000,000 times more powerful to create Uluru.   (Note that this is assuming that the seismic behavior is similar between Earth and Mercury, which is 100% untrue but gives a good enough ROM to see how absurd this would be)  EDIT: after doing some additional research, it looks like energy goes as wave magnitude squared.

This results in a great deal of energy being dissipated into the surrounding environment and causes a great deal of erosion. Engineers have to design spillways very carefully to ensure that the jump happens in an area that isn't vulnerable, if not it has enough energy to literally tear soil or weaker materials apart.

And its not true that they were stagnant for 50,000 years (nor that the only thing they invented was the ~~stick~~ boomerang).  Nevertheless, I believe your conclusion is broadly correct.

And on the other hand we have a deeply racist and sexist point of view that says, no, it is only sacred for one tiny minority (the Anangu) out of a tiny minority of Australians; that people's access to Uluru depends on their race and sex (there are parts which are traditionally forbidden to men, and parts traditionally forbidden to women: the national park asks people not to take photos of those sections lest they are seen by the wrong sex); that only the Anangu can have a spiritual connection to the land there.  We shouldn't dismiss a culture because it is old. We should dismiss it because it is elitist, racist and sexist.  Yes, yes, I know that's the pot calling the kettle black. But at least we're *trying* to be less sexist and racist, not putting discrimination up on a pedestal and saying ""we've always done it this way"".

Trivial and meaningless.  2. Difficult for outsiders to guess. The more difficult the better.  Is it forbidden to climb Uluru, or is it everyone's duty to climb it at least once in their life? Can men climb it, or only boys? (Climb up the rock a boy, climb down a man.) Will rubbing your hand on the rock bring good luck or bad luck? Only one of Us will know for sure.

It doesn't feed their children or prevent the Federal government's on-going war on Aboriginal tribal society. Its a meaningless gesture that really only affects a few(?) thousand tourists a year. But still, it goes against the core value (supposedly) at the heart of Australian culture: equality.  And while, *in theory* at least I might work hard, smooze the right people, earn lots of money, work up the social ladder and become one of the privileged 0.1%, there is *no way in the world* I can change my ancestry and become Anangu.  Even if there is some ritual I can perform to allow me to become a member of the tribe, that's conditional on me going along with the conservative ""traditional"" beliefs.

Ayer's Rock was a symbol of Australia, for **all** Australians, regardless of race, colour or creed. No more. Now a tiny minority of a tiny minority have an unearned privilege over the rest of us. A symbolic one, to be sure, rather than any meaningful power or influence, but a privilege is still a privilege -- even if it is only the privilege to say ""No"".  We (post-contact Australia) have certainly sinned greatly against the indigenous peoples of this continent. And continue to do so, e.g. the Intervention. Banning climbing on Uluru is a meaningless gesture that does nothing to improve Aboriginal's treatment, but panders to the worst parts of their pre-contact culture in a harmful way. I would hate for people to lose all contact with the ancient myths of their ancestors, but encouraging them to keep believing them is just a cynical way of keeping them ignorant and controllable. My ancestors believed a lot of nonsense too. Doesn't mean I have to.  The bottom line is: do you believe that the rock actually was made by boys playing in the mud? If so, then you are too ignorant to have a say. And if not, then why encourage other people to believe something that you know damn well is rubbish? Why force others to treat these myths seriously? Why allow them to enforce sexist, racist and elitist superstitions on who can go to see what part of Uluru?  Just because beliefs are ""traditional"" or ""spiritual"" doesn't make them good.   ^1 I hate that word: whenever somebody claims that something is sacred, it is always a sign that some group is claiming unearned privilege over some other group. Whether it is scientologists, muslims, christians, or ancient religious, you know that some smug fucker is using it as an excuse to keep someone else in a position of subservience. You mustn't question me, because its sacred. You can't do that, because its secret men's business, no women allowed. Can't go there, because the gods will be pissed off.

Your argument is analogous to somebody saying that we have to honour ""Bob's Burgers"" in Asslick Tennessee as a culturally sacred site because otherwise all those brave people in the World Trade Centre would have died for nothing.  Australian aboriginals have never been a single, homogeneous group of people, and the experiences of those on the east coast at the hands of the English are not the same as those in the centre. Nor is Uluru sacred to the Aboriginal tribes of other parts of Australia, except in the modern, post-European colonial sense that Ayer's Rock is a symbol of Australia, a beautiful and awe-inspiring part of the natural landscape for **all** Australians to celebrate.  We, collectively, have committed many sins against the Aboriginal people of Australia, and continue to do so.

I can appreciate the fact that the indigenous people of Australia have faced massive historical injustices, and I think it's  reasonable  for those people to be the owners of the land they traditionally inhabited. Hell, I wouldn't even necessarily be opposed to if Australia outright gave tons of land back to those groups and recognized them as separate sovereign nations that Australia had no authority over, complete with reparation payments.  But here's the thing: As far as I can tell, the decision to not allow climbing is being made on religious grounds. I don't agree that rules or regulations should be made on the basis of religion, that one people's beliefs should dictate what people who don't have those beliefs are allowed to do. I don't think that the fact that these people have historically and still face inequality and oppression changes that: It doesn't make their religious or spiritual views any more real then anybody elses, so peopple shouldn't have to be beholden to them.  Like, if their religious traditions weren't that it's bad to climb Uluru, but rather that it's bad for *women* to climb it, would you all also support a ban only for women climbers?"

The point is that making a natural site more easily accessible by all kinds of people will inevitably also attract those that have no respect for nature and leave trash.  There definitely is a correlation between installed helper trails and amount of trash left behind.  That doesn't mean that everyone that uses the helper trail leaves trash.

When I was talking with a friend about this they brought up the same point, but I don't think it's quite comparable for logistical reasons: Cathedrals, Synagogues, mosques, etc tend to be in urban spaces where there's active infanstructure and people moving about, there's a much greater safety concern issue and it'd be generally disruptive to society as a whole.   Now, if there was, say, a church built into the side of a mountain which was still used or was viewed as sacred due to some miracle said to have happened there historically; and people were denied access to mountain climb on it as a result, even if there wasn't a particularly large safety risk or risk of damage to the church itself; purely on religious respect grounds, then yes, i'd also say that's equally BS.   I'm jewish, but I wouldn't demand that people not take selfies at the Wailing Wall or hell, even Auschwitz. Respect, religious value, etc are subjective things, they should not be something legislateed  >If you want to explore Conner it's only possible on a private tour, because it's private property. White man's property, part of the Curtin Springs station. So how about we order the owners of Curtin Springs to get off their high horse and open Mount Conner to all comers? It's probably a much safer rock to climb, being nice and flat on top.  I'm not disputing the indigenous people's claim to their land and the site, I think it's reasonable for them to have it (for the most part). My issue is their rationale: That because it's sacred to them, other people should be be beholden to their belief system, and not have access to it when there would otherwise not be a problem.   I'm less saying I don't think they should be able to do it, and more that I just personally disagree with their decision, though I'd also argue that even if it's their territory, perhaps they still shouldn't be able to do it: I don't think goverments should have the ability to make policy descisions or regulations on the basis of religion, and indigenous nations or states shouldn't be immune to that. Again, you probably wouldn't defend a rule or law of theirs that gives women less rights, if such a rule existed, right?  Also, something i'm a bit unclear on, and perhaps you can inform me of this, is of if uluru is still used by the indigious people for religious ceremonies: If it is, and *they* can climb it, then that's discrimination, full stop."

They haven't allowed time for the name change to sink in - Uluru was dual-named for years before switching over to primarily be Uluru. 2.

""K'gari"" is pronounced ""Gurri"" or ""Garry"".

No aboriginal language was written, so any spelling has been made up.  Therefore, there is no need to introduce silent letters which are historical anachronisms in English.

18t7bx7,kfdgw5x,AskAnAustralian,None,1703825810.0,"Historically names change over time, new people overcome the old and change names to suit their beliefs. This has happened since the beginning of time. I am sure the Pygmy peoples that populated the coastal land prior to aboriginal settling in those areas had names for landmarks and when they were conquered by the new comers the names were changed and so the cycle continues. However I am not saying either name is wrong what I am saying it does not matter. What matters is we get past this them and us crap and work together to create a new Australia.   At this moment we are reliving the past as if it is the future. We as one nation need to get past this finger pointing and guilt complex that seems to drive the hatred between our population. Yes there is racism on both side of this argument, driven mainly by poor education and fear mongering.  Through social media the young people of today have a never before opportunity to bring this nation together and force governments to interact with not just the wealthy but every person in this country from the smallest of Outback communities to the largest cities. But no, they would sooner enforce social propaganda ideals risen from partial truths and bad teaching.  It has been proven time and again throughout history that when something is forced onto a populous they will rebel. Uluru is a good example of this, as mentioned  it was restored to its original name in the 80‚Äôs and the name grew up with the children. However, when the rule came out preventing ppl climbing it there was no explanation, no story, so ppl rebelled.  In the 80‚Äôs ABC had 5 minute animated story that spoke of the dreaming, around the time kids were sitting down to watch cartoons etc, this helped the young understand, including some of us that were not taught culture because of their parents fear. Since then even some of the aboriginal children have lost their true culture and rely on media driven catch phrase education to try and get their frustration across which in turn helps no one and fuels more hatred.  The time for recompense is gone, the time for joining is now we all need each other, we see the world outside Australia falling apart and here we are bickering over the mistakes of history, we can be better than that, we are better than that."

And the fact that you are being so unnecessarily difficult for a simple question really doesn't help your cause at all.  Many people are not aware that Fraser Island has had a name change. Unnecessarily being a prick to people who are not aware does nothing to move K'Gari into the mainstream vocabulary like what happened when Uluru changed from Ayers Rock.

And as for the others, if we were naming those places today then I would absolutely say they should be spelled phonetically.  I do care for the actual language - because it's important these things are not lost.  But it's a spoken language, therefore any spelling is arbitrary and should be made as simple to pronounce as possible.  I really don't understand why this is a problem?  What benefit does adding the silent ""K"" in ""K'gari"" bring?  It's not pronounced, all it seems to do is add confusion.  It seems like it was added purely to make it look more exotic."

When the Uluru statement was given to the government (under Morrison) it was a one page document signed on bark and delivered to parliament.   Given Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull repeatedly described it as a one page statement while they were PM it's a bit weird that those who oppose it also called it a one page document until peta credlin ""discovered"" a public document that is something the PM has never referenced as agreeing to.  Also shockingly if the voice happens, it doesn't mean treaty. If the voice starts up and immediately demands reperations the parliament decides on that, and if we don't like it when whoever is in starts trying to agree to them we can vote them out.   Also Dutton's questions did get answered. The voice model isn't in the constitution and is up to parliament.

This link is the basis of the ownership of the soil, or better, of sovereignty. It has never been ceded or extinguished, and co-exists with the sovereignty of the Crown.  >How could it be otherwise? That peoples possessed a land for sixty millennia and this sacred link disappears from world history in merely the last two hundred years?   >With substantive constitutional change and structural reform, we believe this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia‚Äôs nationhood.   >Proportionally, we are the most incarcerated people on the planet. We are not an innately criminal people. Our children are aliened from their families at unprecedented rates. This cannot be because we have no love for them. And our youth languish in detention in obscene numbers. They should be our hope for the future.   >These dimensions of our crisis tell plainly the structural nature of our problem. This is the torment of our powerlessness.   >We seek constitutional reforms to empower our people and take a rightful place in our own country. When we have power over our destiny our children will flourish. They will walk in two worlds and their culture will be a gift to their country.   >We call for the establishment of a First Nations Voice enshrined in the Constitution.   >Makarrata is the culmination of our agenda: the coming together after a struggle. It captures our aspirations for a fair and truthful relationship with the people of Australia and a better future for our children based on justice and self-determination.   >We seek a Makarrata Commission to supervise a process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations and truth-telling about our history.   >In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we seek to be heard.

The Referendum Council is the body that knows exactly what the Statement is, and the Council's contemporaneous words should be preferred over what anyone is saying now. In the Council's report, it clearly refers to a longer Statement than the one-pager.   I acknowledge that the Council's 26 May 2017 press release says the full statement would be in the final report, but this does not appear to have happened.  My view that the full statement is not in the report is further supported by the introductory words to the Council's report, where the report states: ""Copyright in extracts from the Uluru Statement from the Heart reproduced in this report vests with the Mutitjulu Community Aboriginal Corporation and are reproduced with its permission.""

This entire process around the Uluru Statement is pitched as a journey of ""healing"" and ""truth-telling"". Yet, when someone seeks clarity or raises questions, they're sidelined, treated as misinformed, or even accused of spreading disinformation. Moreover, it seems the 'Yes' campaign strategically avoids certain topics, likely because they're unpopular, and not due to any perceived ""poisoning of the well."" Why are some truths or perspectives seemingly more valid than others? If we're genuinely committed to reconciliation and understanding, then let's have a full, open conversation. Otherwise, let's stop pretending this is about truth at all.  Personally, I think 'The Voice' is a bad idea because it is vague, a special privilege that no other person living in Australia will ever receive (no matter their circumstance) and would be too hard to remove if it turns into a shamble and frankly I think it will turn into a bureaucratic waste of money that won't do anything to achieve its aims and just become another ATSIC, only this time constitutionally enshrined. I don't care about how many pages a document is. I care about 'The Voice' and the values and goals that went into its creation and there's a whole lot of context there that Yes-campaigners don't want to touch with a ten-foot pole for a reason. I don't need to poison any wells or muddy any waters. The yes-campaigners are doing a good job of that themselves.

Edit: not trying to start anything, I largely agree with what you've said above and below. Just seems like you're defending something that doesn't warrant defending, and that you don't even do."
1aefkpn,kk7rnhw,AskAnAustralian,None,1706589122.0,"I wasn't that interested in going, but my gf wanted to go so we did. I absolutely loved the place - very glad I went. Make sure you have enough time to go to Kata Tjuta while you're there too. If you've got the time to make the trip, go to Kings Canyon too - about a 4 hour drive away, but the walk there is probably one of the best I've ever done."
1aefkpn,kk7satp,AskAnAustralian,inhumanfriday,1706589435.0,"Can't comment on the resort, but I visited Uluru about 15 years ago and loved it. I wasn't really all that interested initially but I made friends with an international student who was keen to visit so I decided to tag along. Its incomprehensibly big and I was overawed by the size of it as we approached in the tour bus. I didn't realise how big it was. I didn't climb out of respect for the requests by the Traditional Custodians but walked (or cycled? Can't quite remember) around the base and it was amazing. It's like 8kms in circumference.   The tour visited at sunrise and sunset too and it looks completely at different times of the day.   Totally recommend but I imagine you'd also want to do other things in the area too as Uluru itself is probably just a full day activity kind of thing."
1aefkpn,kk87czb,AskAnAustralian,NowWow070297,1706598057.0,"I went in Feb 2020 just before COVID hit. It was one of the best experiences of my life. I spent 4 days there, visiting both Uluru and Kata Tju·πØa. It‚Äôs amazing watching the colours change in the rock during sunrise and sunset, and I really recommend the guided walk around the base- it‚Äôs a long walk, but I learned so much about the significance of the rock and stories of the different features. Also the indigenous exhibit near the rock is great too.  The resort is expensive- I stayed in a cabin in the caravan park with a couple of friends. It was relatively inexpensive and had everything we needed including a little kitchen. I don‚Äôt know about now, but one thing that surprised me was that the prices in the little supermarket for food were not outrageous at the time- just a bit more than Sydney prices. I reckon 3-4 days is enough to see everything and enjoy it."

Uluru was all I dreamed of and more.   Some considerations if you go: - Yulara Resort precinct is heavily sanitized for tourism despite the cultural and spiritual magnificence of the place - Visit the Cultural Centre in the Park to hear from Anangu people the stories of Uluru and surrounding areas - Some places around Uluru and surrounding areas have gender specific cultural protocols which should be respected  - there is a camp ground in the resort precinct - buy a park pass for entry into the Nat Park - there is a petrol station, IGA, post office, etc in the town centre of Yulara - sunset viewing areas of Uluru get crazy busy, instead visit at sunrise when it is quiet as  To sit and be in the presence of Uluru inspires a sense of humility and quietness - a feeling that still fills me with wonder nearly twelve months later."

There are several levels of accommodation from hostel to ritzy so you do have some choices. It's absolutely worth seeing. I recommend seeing Uluru at sunrise, walking around the rock with a guide, also the Field of Lights, and walking through Kata Tjuta. You can also visit the local art centre at Mutitjulu."
1aefkpn,kk86fjv,AskAnAustralian,212404808,1706597444.0,"Not fun, but majestic. The full walk around the base is very doable and I think it'd be quite special doing it solo. You could go to the free guided ranger talk in the morning (which gives you some Anangu context) and then walk the rest of the way on your own or join with whoever else is there. At night you see more stars than you've ever seen. Definitely go to Kata Tjuta too. The resort is very average, especially for that price (it's like a 3 star motel at 5 star prices) but Uluru itself is so worthwhile. I'm not normally a spiritual person nor particularly outdoorsy but it really moved me."

From the air it looks like an arrowhead, pointing at Mutitjulu.  I have seen people burst into tears when they sight the rock on the flight in, it can evoke that kind of reaction.  It is also damn hot during the day, and freezing at night.  You will need a park pass to get in, the pass is for 3 days and will cost you $38 (at time of writing)."

As a proud sandgroper, though, the largest rock in the world is in Western Australia, Mt Augustus. It's just not isolated in the middle of a flat plain and looming over everything like Uluru is so is considered less spectacular. But apparently it's bigger."

r6vfd,c43kzz8,pics,rajmohab,1332383117.0,"I did a base walk around it about 6 months ago. Our tour guide has been doing trips around Uluru for about 15 years and gave us all a talk about the choice to climb it, or not, the night before we headed there.  First on the list of reasons not to climb it, is that it's a sacred place to the Aboriginal people who own it and have been living there for over 20 thousand years. 20 thousand years. People climb up it and find they need to piss, because it's a long ass climb, and they have no choice but to piss on the most sacred part of the place, which then gets into the waterfalls etc around it.  Secondly, any time someone gets hurt or dies doing it, the Aboriginal landowners enter a period of mourning, as they feel responsible for the safety of everyone who visits. It can last weeks or more and usually involves them hitting themselves on the head with a rock until they bleed as part of the tradition.  So if that's not reason enough, there's also the fact that a bunch of people have died doing it or been otherwise injured. That and really, the climb isn't what it's about - the view from the top is pretty much just empty desert. The really interesting stuff is on the ground at the different important sites around it, the waterfalls, paintings, etc.  Thankfully they're closing the climb this year I believe, and I'm glad they are.

I remember reading when the news proclaimed they'd finally ban anyone from climbing it and there was such a massive increase in people venturing there to do it.  I thought it was so offensive, but a good amount of them didn't give a damn. I agreed with the elders that those who climbed it should be stricken down by bad luck. But Uluru is something else when compared to Wollumbin, I do believe that information displays should be put in specific areas to help educate people about it."

v4ycxj,ib79pjw,australia,None,1654389605.0,"One of the issues for Uluru was lack of public facilities. Of course you can't have toilets on top of Uluru, but people were using it as one as well as leaving their rubbish up there too. If it ever rained, then all that would go into the few precious watering holes at the base where there's a rare species of shrimp.

You see that and wonder just how much rubbish must've been washed off the rock into the waterholes over the years.  It was also closed for safety. I'm all for having dangerous places signposted but still accessible, but in Uluru's case I suppose they just got sick of having to rescue people who tried to get down some other way. Plus, so many tourists would head up there for a few hours in the middle of the day with the 300ml water bottle they got on the plane, and by the time they're back on the ground they look like they're going to collapse from heat exhaustion."

A quarter of a million people climbed Uluru every year, after years of 'educational materials', getting injured, leaving human waste, rubbish, and generally acting like a sacred site was for a fun afternoon stroll rather than something that had profound relevance for the group that's lived there for tens of thousands of years of faith.

I might not be inclined to climb it if i was asked not to, but i don't think the law should be used to stop people doing it.   I think there's a bit of a grey area in this because i have the same opinion about Uluru - i think people should be allowed to climb it if it's treated with respect, and the local indigenous people should be able to ask people not to do it in the first place - out of respect.  My idea of respecting it is to not throw shit around on top of it or dump garbage everywhere. But i might still want to see the view from the top. For the local indigenous people, walking on top of it *is* disrespecting it. If humans died out in a thousand years and theres no story to associate it with it anymore, it'd just be a big rock and nobody would be around to care.   So who's right? People always just draw the line below what they would do.  Either way, It seems like the law is a bit of a blunt instrument when it comes to this kind of thing."

dmu80j,f54xrce,australia,None,1571994541.0,"They set a target where if less than 20% of people going to Uluru climbed it, they said they would stop the climb. Both of these things have now happened.  So, <20% of people that were going there (and how many were actually going there to scale it or did it because they were there anyway?)..."
dmu80j,f55drje,australia,MrFreaky12345,1572005546.0,I think equating climbing Ayers Rock to white supremacy is a bit extreme  It may be disrespectful but it's not white supremacy.
dmu80j,f55hqkk,australia,RhysHarp,1572007695.0,It's called Uluru. Ayers Rock is a shit name.
dmu80j,f55d0g3,australia,onecoffeeplease,1572005122.0,"You raise an interesting point. Indigenous peoples throughout Australia relate to sites, landscape features, waterways, ocean, sky, plants and animals in a very different way to non-indigenous people.  You seem to associate higher cultural values with the built environment than natural features. Conversely indigenous people see the built environment as ephemeral and less relevent than the country and especially features like Uluru that have persisted in their stories and their environment for many millenia.   Think about some of humanities most iconic and ancient built structures, like the pyramids that are probably less than 5000 years old and how much heritage human cultures have and continue to associate with those structures. Now imagine you consider yourself a disciple (for want of a better word) of the land and a structure like Uluru has been a place of reverence for your people for at least 10,000 years and perhaps over 50,000 years and your culture has passed down knowledge/stories associated with that 'rock' for hundreds of generations.  We don't relate to the natural environment like indigenous people but just because we don't understand or relate to their culture and connection to country doesn't mean we can't respect and admire it for how rare and important their culture is to human history and culture more broadly."
dmu80j,f59bds2,australia,MrFreaky12345,1572081059.0,It's called either Uluru or Ayers Rock.
dmu80j,f59bd95,australia,MrFreaky12345,1572081035.0,You're really trying to make the argument that calling it Ayers Rock is white supremacy?  Wow....
dmu80j,f59xlkj,australia,RhysHarp,1572097103.0,"Why not just call it Uluru? It's what the indigenous people called it before white people came.  How would you like it if another race invaded your home land, took hundreds of years to apologize and knew the name of something that was sacred to you but chose to call it something shit like ""Ayers Rock"""
dmu80j,f5a6g4m,australia,MrFreaky12345,1572101324.0,"It doesn't matter what it was called before Europeans arrived here, I can use both Uluru or Ayers Rock when referring to the massive rock in the middle of Australia.  I don't have anything against calling it Uluru, but both names can be used and I just happen to use Ayers Rock since that's what I've grown up calling it."
dmu80j,f554pf8,australia,laserframe,1571999615.0,"It's a natural wonder that shouldn't belong to anyone, same as the Great Barrier Reef, Grand Canyon, Mount Everest etc  It shouldn't be a case of who saw it first, someone shouldn't be born with an inherent right over Uluru to the next person, this is the same principal as our beaches not being privately owned, there is a public interest in everyone having equal access to that natural beauty."
dmu80j,f586oq0,australia,NothappyJane,1572049745.0,"White supremacy doesn't have to be an overt belief system where you're running around at rallies with tiki torches, it can just be as simple as climbing Uluru after you've planned an entire holiday around the deadline because you think you're entitled to ignore traditional beliefs or your individual rights and experiences matter more than theirs on their own land.   Why don't you pull your head in. It's Indigenous peoples land. You can't just go and do whatever the fuck you want on other peoples land without being called out for that."
dmu80j,f557d4f,australia,datyams,1572001715.0,"Unbelievable.... since when has being logical and apply reason been so frowned upon??  There are all sorts of sacred sites people visit and walk on, the pyramids, Stonehenge etc etc  What now? Do the individual indigenous communities get to shut down access to other random areas around AUS that they consider ""sacred""?  There are thousands of these sites, Uluru is just the most salient. What a load of shit..."
dmu80j,f597ph1,australia,yaboy_69,1572075072.0,"But that's not what I said, at all  I only suggested that equating climbing Uluru to the actions of the KKK or Nazis is a little OTT, please don't put words in my mouth"
dmu80j,f557nec,australia,onecoffeeplease,1572001901.0,"We manage our common goods (natural wonders) so they can be maintained and enjoyed over time by the most people. Some sites have not only natural values but also cultural values. We place rules and limits so as to maintain a sites natural and cultural values for 'everyone'. We regulate how people interact with the Great Barrier Reef by limiting tourist charters and commercial fising to protect its natural values, just like we are now regulating how tourist interact with Uluru to protect the cultural and natural values of this site."
dmu80j,f55jjky,australia,ademiiix,1572008628.0,"People don't walk on Stonehenge, they walk around it. Same as Uluru now.  ""What now? Do the individual indigenous communities get to shut down access to other random areas around AUS that they consider ""sacred""?""  No."
dmu80j,f55kstj,australia,datyams,1572009272.0,"HAHAHA says who? You? No offence but your opinion counts for sweet fuck all.  Pretty sure there are still Pagan communities who still worship the multiple Henge's and consider them sacred, bit on the nose for you to come out and call it a Dead society don't you think? Maybe a little bit privileged? Not very woke of you.  I mean, not touching them flies sure,but the Pyramids actively encourage INTERNAL tours?? I don't see the point of difference, aside from the fact that they are not a naturally formed geological feature with cultural values placed on it in a relatively truncated timescale.  Ill be the first one laughing when they reopen the stupid climb anyway once the tourist dollar dies in the arse, Ive been to Alice, and to Uluru, its a shithole and that rock is the only thing attracting people there."
