2100rv,cg8n68s,EarthPorn,gratedrabbit,1395441796.0,Alice Springs is my home town.....so many places like this. Ormiston Gorge and Ellery Big Hole were amongst my favorites.
1lsbzj1,n1ljxl5,AustraliaTravel,Coalclifff,1751786069.0,"We lived in Alice Springs for six years and Darwin for ten years, so of course we are rather fond of the Northern Territory.  And while I think the West MacDonnell's are one of the best 100 km you can do in the country, I reluctantly agree with the others that - on a fairly short trip - four nights for the Big Three is enough (Kings Canyon, Uluru, and Kata Tjuta).  If this gives you six nights in Sydney rather than four, then it's a sacrifice worth making.  Make sure you don't waste those Sydney days - tourist trinkets like HOHO buses and harbour tours are totally unnecessary, as is the bridge climb in my view, but I've not done it.  So your five full days in The Emerald City can cover:  * Manly Beach by ferry and Taronga Zoo (on the same day, via Balmoral Beach) * Watsons Bay Ferry, Bondi Beach, Coastal Walk to Coogee, Bondi Junction * Blue Mountains day-trip (cheap train from Central to Katoomba about 7:00 AM) * Old Sydney and Queer Sydney (Domain, NSWAG, Museum, Taylor Square, Kings Cross) * I would try to fit in Pyrmont, Glebe, Balmain, Paddington, Surry Hills, and Newtown as well * The Rocks, Barangaroo, Darling Harbour, Maritime Museum, Chinatown, Pitt Street Mall  That's a pretty good program. Public transport is excellent - so I recommend you use it."

1anzzcl,kpw7wyg,AskAnAustralian,aquila-audax,1707634330.0,"Jetstar is having a sale on flights into Yulara at the moment, so it's a good time to grab a bargain. You can fold some tourist activities (like Field of Lights) into your accommodation costs when you book into the resort, or you can book it separately if you're camping. AAT Kings do bus tours to Kata Tjuta, Kings Canyon, and along the West Macs. None of this is cheap though. Late May is usually a good time to come, warm days with cool nights."

1j24xoz,mfp6lo4,AustraliaTravel,Coalclifff,1740961722.0,"Some comments and questions:  * For me, Cairns (Port Douglas) is a *much* better Great Barrier Reef land base than the Whitsundays * More to see and do, the Reef is closer, and flights are much better * Fly UK > Singapore / BKK / KUL > Cairns, then Cairns > Gold Coast (OOL)  You have the time to rent a vehicle in Alice Springs, and drive:  * Namatjira Drive to Glen Helen (West MacDonnell's) and return - 2D * Drive to Kings Canyon (Watarrka NP) - 2D * Drive to Yulara (Uluru and Kata Tjuta) - 3D * Drive back to Kulgera, and take the road south to Adelaide (Coober Pedy, Flinders) * Adelaide wine regions, and it's a nice city  You either drop the car and take a plane, train, or bus to Melbourne, or you drive the vehicle over two days on the straight highway, or 3-4 days via the GOR.  Note that the world's best football code is called ""NRL"" or ""League"" ... ""Rugby"" generally means Rugby Union (played by pansies and toffs) - except among Melbourne people who are woefully ignorant about both games. ðŸ™ƒ"
1j24xoz,mmsd6i4,AustraliaTravel,Particular-Heat4094,1744488739.0,"Hey guys, posted an updated itinerary.. just incase any of you lovely peeps were following lol...  Planning a mad month itinerary for Oz in May 2025. Iâ€™ve gone into a lot of detail, I am just very excited! Our fixed dates are a family wedding and hopefully the State of Origin game, and we hope that the other highlights will be Barrier Reef and some time in the Outback.  We are two persons for the full trip, my partner and I (30s & 40s) are reasonable fitness, like to keep busy, but also wonâ€™t be on the go at 8am every morning! We are both fine with hiking, snorkelling, like to take a lot of pictures and visit the odd museum, experiencing a bit of culture.  My mum (70s) will join us for the first week in Cairns. She is also active, but given her age wonâ€™t want to be running around knackering herself out! Iâ€™d love feedback on the itinerary, specifically the following:  o Cairns area: Where do you think to stay for 3rd-4th-5th? ***I have heard that Cairns and Port Douglas are good bases, but I think they are too much like resorts for our taste? ***My partner is interested in staying on Fitzroy island? But I think that would be too much of a faff to get to and from rainforest etc? One idea is to stay the first two nights on Fitzroy and then transfer to Cairns island? ***I like the idea of experience of experiencing a unique place like Cape Tribulation but I donâ€™t know if it is too isolated for a couple of nights? ***Are we better to fly from Gold Coast / Brisbane to Alice Springs and then hire van to drive South or vice versa? oWhat do you think about the Outback section?  Anyway, so here we go!  â€¢ Late evening Thurs 30th June/early Friday 1st May: departure from Northeast Scotland â€¢ Late Saturday 2nd or early Sunday 3rd: arrival in Cairns â€¢ Sunday 3rd: chill & transfer to hotel â€¢ Monday 4th & Tuesday 5th: chill & barrier reef â€¢ Wed 6th: Copper Creek wilderness â€“ Daintree discovery centre & river cruise â€“ mossman gorge â€“ Cathedral fig tree â€“ eat in Yungaburra. Sleep in either Chambers Wildlife rainforest lodges or canopy rainforest wildlife sanctuary â€¢ Thurs 7th: Milaa Milaa Falls - Zillie Falls - Eillinjaa Falls - Wallicher Falls - Tchupala Falls - Josephine Falls - Evening flight to Gold Coast â€¢ Friday 8th: family time â€¢ Sat 9th: wedding â€¢ Sun 10th, Mon 11th, Tuesday 12th: family time â€¢ Tuesday 12th: Evening flight to Outback â€¢ Wed 13th: chill in Alice springs, museum, gallery â€¢ Thursday 14th: Simpsons Gap - Standley Chasm - Ellery Creek Big Hole (3km hike) - Serpentine Gorge - Ochre Pits - Camp at Ormiston gorge â€¢ Friday 15th: Ormiston gorge - glen helon gorge - redbank gorge (30 min hike) - Mount Sonder hike (6 hours) â€¢ Sat 16th: 2 hour drive to Kings Canyon - 4 hour rim walk (easy) - drive towards Uluru â€¢ Sun 17th: finish drive to kata Tjuta - chilled 4 hour hike â€¢ Mon 18th: cycle round uluru (presumably bikes are easy enough to hire) â€¢ Tues 19th: 8 hour drive to Coober Pedy - stop at Kanku-Breakaways â€¢ Wed 20th & Thurs 21st: 2 chilled days at Coober Pedy - Tom's Opal Mine - Umoona - Josephine's Gallery - Old Timers - Serbian Orthodox Church â€¢ Friday 22nd: Drive oodnadatta track to Flinders â€“ possible to go via Lake Eyre? I donâ€™t think so without a huge detour â€¢ Sat 23rd: arrival at Flinders, lunchtimish â€¢ Sun 24th: Brachina Gorge - Bunyeroo Gorge - Stokes Hill - Rawnsley Bluff - Wangara Lookouts Hike â€¢ Mon 25th: 5 hour drive to Adelaide airport via Moralana Scenic Drive - Jeff Morgan Gallery - Bumbunga Lake â€“ evening flight to Melbourne â€¢ Tues 26th- sat 30th: State of Origin rugby league on Wednesday 27th, flight home on Sat 30th, arrival on Sunday 31st, back to work on Monday 1st!"
1j24xoz,mfu39jv,AustraliaTravel,Coalclifff,1741031878.0,"They're going all that way, and want to experience some outback. They shouldn't miss the Alice Springs Desert Park, the West MacDonnell's and Kings Canyon ... all very good. And Coober Pedy / Flinders Ranges are pretty out-there as well.  Renting a van one-way might be a challenge - but a Toyota Hiace style van should be possible."
1iec3bw,ma6chlz,OutdoorAus,Marshy462,1738321022.0,"Iâ€™ve been 3 times over the years. I found camping to be safe and easy. Sunsets on the rock are easy, just drive, take your dinner and some drinks. You can self walk around the base and see some caves etc.   Personally the real magic in in the west macdonnell ranges."
15n0nz4,mdjwgbt,UltralightAus,cheesehotdish,1739935004.0,"I reckon Larapinta is heaps better than Jatbula anyway. You can definitely have a relaxing experience on Larapinta, some of the sections arenâ€™t too hard.   If I had six days and wanted to go easier Iâ€™d probably go from Ellery Creek and hike around to camp at Ellery North then continue on to Ormiston Gorge. Thereâ€™s some climbs and scrambles through that section but nothing too bad and you can have short days to split it up.   Honestly when I went I camped alone at Ellery North, Serpentine Gorge and then a random creek bed in section 9. Then only two others at Hermits Hideaway.   The ends of the trail and road accessible sites that have public camping for cars are busy (like Ormiston Gorge). But at Ormiston you camp away from the cars, though it still felt sort of busy.   High camps are usually less busy, but they can also be less available space so you have to hedge your bets."
