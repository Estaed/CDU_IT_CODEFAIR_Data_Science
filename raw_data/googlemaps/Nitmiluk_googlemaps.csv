That is $560 per week to enter the land.",2

Nitmiluk,Michael Greig,"If you like cruises its probably ok but as regards swimming its a 9 km hike to the closest spot, and even then it is currently ""not recommended"".

Nitmiluk,Matt Apeldoorn,Horribly signposted. Views are ok without being amazing. No one at the help desk until 3pm about enquiries. Ridiculously long hikes to see gorges.
