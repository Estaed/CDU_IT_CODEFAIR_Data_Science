Kakadu,Jack Mower,I explored Kakadu on a day trip from Darwin with Autopia tours. Our guide Aaron was super knowledgeable and gave loads of information on the rock art and some of the specious of wildlife we saw along the way. The park itself is stunning and you must go to the top of the viewpoint to take it all in.,5
Kakadu,Andrew Sayer,Nothing else like it on the planet. Go up in a plane or helicopter and do a lap or two out of Jabiru. Do a river Yellow River cruise and try not to be eaten by a croc. Jim Jim falls is worth a visit. Play your cards right and come down in late April.,5
