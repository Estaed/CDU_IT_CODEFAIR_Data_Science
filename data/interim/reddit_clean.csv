Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs is a great town. It‚Äôs got the small town friendliness. But for it size it is very progressive and has a large arts scene. The media loves to give attention incidents in Alice Springs, but the main thing you‚Äôll experience in day to day life is the need for increase home security. Not a lot of tech jobs around. Your partner might want to look at remote work."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If your not prepared to be confronted with some extremely harsh realities of social inequality and how the government has failed large swarths of remote communities, don't go. Because you might be in for a rough awakening. There are many great things about Alice Springs, but it has ingrained problems that much of Brisbane does not (or at least does not tolerate)"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"üòÇ ""outer suburbs"" you do realise Alice Springs is about 30 000 people?? Not sure that means there are actually divided ""suburbs"""
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you want to learn first hand about indigenous culture, Alice Springs is a great place to live and work. I say ""go for it!""."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's not a matter of faith. The reality is that it can be very tough to live in Alice Springs, and most people bail."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,There are lots of little amazing towns all over Australia‚Ä¶. Alice Springs is not one of them
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Heaps of places in Australia that are geographically amazing without the risk of getting your head kicked in. The answers here range from don't go it's dangerous to you should go but never leave your house and build a compound fence. There are massive social and economic issues that are only getting worse. You WILL have multiple negative interactions with people in Alice Springs. You WILL be yelled at and harassed, and depending where you are that might be a very common thing. If the risk to your safety and well being is worth it then go because that is the cost of moving there."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I don't know Alice Springs, I've never been to Alice Springs or never had any contact with anyone from Alice Springs but... *(sobbing)* I'm sorry I can't go on. *(sobbing)*"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs is honestly a lovely amazing place and community. Darren Clarke runs action for Alice 2020 on fb and has the best bakery in town. (Best pies in the NT I reckon) Top top bloke. I did FIFO in and out of Alice Springs for 3 years - I absolutely love the place. However, it has a dark side. Anything you think you know about the indigenous - you‚Äôre in for a shock, so be prepared. You‚Äôll see a lot of things you don‚Äôt understand and can‚Äôt make sense of. I stopped doing fifo because I simply didn‚Äôt feel safe. My straw that broke the camels back was a Wednesday night, I was playing trivia at uncles tavern (awesome place, amaaazzzing waffle fries) and it was 20:45, I went out for a smoke, (and uncles tavern is surrounded by big black iron metal gates), I was standing outside, and this absolute mob of young indigenous kids (aged 8 - 12 ish) came up to me and the ringleader said ‚Äúoi, give us a fckn smoke‚Äù. And I said ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt you be in bed?‚Äù And this kid looks me in the eye, and he said ‚Äúgive me a fckn smoke now or I‚Äôll ram this iron gate so far up your cunt youll bleed out of your eyes like the cunt I killed yesterday‚Äù. The look in this kids eyes is something I‚Äôll never forget. Like a cross between pure hate and just plain malevolence. So I went and got security. He just shrugged. He said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do anything, he‚Äôs indigenous, he‚Äôs untouchable‚Äù. I love Alice Springs, always will - but be safe. If you go out at night - stay in well lit areas, don‚Äôt trust the longrassers and try to stay somewhere gated / locked."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"From someone who has lived & worked in Alice Springs, not recently though, please go & experience it, the art, the indigenous culture, the history, the country & it‚Äôs truly amazing places to see. Australia‚Äôs centre can get under your skin, in a good way - it‚Äôs the essence, the spirit of Australia, you will feel it. If people you hear hating on it maybe it‚Äôs because of what they heard or their own experience & I hope doesn‚Äôt put you off going. Make sure you visit Araluen the art centre & the many gorges. I lived in Milner Rd not far from Araluen. There is so much to see and do. And if you have a few days a trip to Uluru is the best. Or, if you have a lot of nrg - the Larapinta Trail. Starts from Telegraph Station. Try not to let what you have heard stop you going as it is worth the experience. You will find out what NOT to do to remain safe. Alice Springs is still the big centre of the NT & operates as that. It saddens me to hear all the bad things happening as I think it‚Äôs special. Have faith & stay safe. Cheers :-)."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"There's quite a turnover in Alice Springs, because it's a place where shit white people go to experience not being bottom of the shit pile for the only time in their lives. Avoid these people, don't pander to aboriginal people, they're not stupid, always leave the house with a pocketful of change and don't go walking alone at night for any reason. edit: I should say that you shouldn't go outside alone after dark anywhere in Australia. Sure, everyone has a right to go anywhere unmolested, I completely agree. Just like I've got the right to go for a swim in the ocean anytime I please, so long as I can fight off a Bull Shark."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Why don‚Äôt you go visit Alice Springs before moving there and decide if you want to make such a big decision?
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Alice Springs was recently named one of the top 20 most dangerous 'cities' in the world ([link](https://insidelocalgovernment.com.au/alice-springs-ranked-in-worlds-top-20-most-dangerous-cities/)). As a single young person I would not consider it!
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Can‚Äôt wait for your post after you live there. ‚ÄúAlice Springs, I can‚Äôt take it anymore‚Ä¶.‚Äù üòÇ"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I've been to Alice Springs, back in 2001 mind you. I found it was a nice country town"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We stayed in Alice Springs for 3 days about 6 months ago. We were told when we arrived to desist from going out at night but we saw nothing to worry about, so we did go out every night for dinner, on one occasion, walking a couple of kms to an area many people designated as ""trouble"". Well, we never encountered any acts of aggression or related problems. In fact, we were often greeted with a ""good evening"" by the many people we saw wherever we walked. Whatever it is that people worry about in Alice Springs, we never encountered it. From anyone."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Which is more dangerous / unsafe? Alice Springs NT OR Townsville QLD ?
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's a third world country. Plan for 5 years, do not take valuables with you and do not leave your house at night or even slightly unsecured. Check that your address that you're moving too isn't subject to alcohol restrictions (they're locked down by house) and drive an GM as it can't be easily stolen since the whole ignition barrel breaks when they try and bypass the starter motor. Alice Springs is decorated in indigenous art as those things will not be or will be less likely to be destroyed. [This video](https://youtu.be/YGz1Tiaying?si=QbfbIBlDt9eCE33v) might give you a small idea of what you're about to walk into."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I read these things and I wonder if it‚Äôs a different Alice Springs I‚Äôve lived and worked in. Definitely not the place in Australia I‚Äôve felt the least safe, not by a long shot"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Babe wake up, new Alice Springs tourism slogan just dropped."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,The mainstream media reports on crime and disadvantage in Alice Springs constantly. I honestly can‚Äôt remember the last time I saw Alice Springs mentioned in the news for anything else. It was a high coverage talking point between the Prime Minister and the Opposition leader in at least two separate news cycles just in the last year
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I‚Äôd really recommend Broome. There‚Äôs a great art scene, beautiful beaches but you‚Äôre still close enough to the Kimberley‚Äôs and Pilbara for those beautiful gorges and sites very similar to the likes of Alice Springs. It‚Äôs a big enough town where there‚Äôs plenty of shops, but still a country town. With heaps of backpackers being around for half the year there‚Äôs that opportunity for a fun night out, whilst the other half of the year you can enjoy the quiet of the town and it‚Äôs beautiful storms. Obviously the community has its issue with crime, but not as bad as Alice Springs."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I moved to Alice Springs for three years because of comments like this. It‚Äôs confronting, it‚Äôs heartbreaking and it was an amazing experience. It didn‚Äôt change my mind. I still think we need to close the gap, and I‚Äôll stop talking about inequality when the life span, education completion, incarceration, and infant mortality of Aboriginal people is the same as everyone else. (How far will Ivonava go to prove a point? At least 2,000 km)"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Not what I've read from residents who used to live in Alice Springs prior to Ayers Rock closing.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Not what I've read from people who used to live in Alice Springs when it was ""beautiful"" before they closed Ayers Rock. Now the roads in and out are lined with dirty roadside camps of alcoholics who want to be close to the bottle shops and meth dealers. Bring in the Chinese to nuke Pine Gap and the toxic CIA who run it and are most likely supplying the meth, and that will clean the whole place up beautifully. No Pine Gap. No US military. Get used to the idea."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,That's a hot take. What stats are you seeing that suggest Alice Springs is safer than the entire state of Queensland?
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Not a great comparison. El Salvador has drug smuggling/people smuggling gangs dealing in huge sums of money and with heavy connections in politics, the police and military inside and outside El Salvador. Alice Springs has domestic violence and opportunistic street crime where the payoff mightn't be enough to supply the culprit drugs for a day."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Again, I can‚Äôt comment on that - and I feel like there‚Äôs 2 sides to this story. What exactly are you doing to help the people of Alice Springs? Sweet FA?"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"From what I've read the locals who used to live in Alice Springs prior to the major tourist attraction being closed down have said it used to be a beautiful place. But now that the money isn't coming in so much from tourism the major drawcard is the bottle shops. The camps have appeared along the major highways and they are filthy, apparently, and an eyesore for any travellers. The trip advice is to keep driving through and stop for petrol only. In recent years the media reported the major violent outbreaks by youths and vandalism in the town that nobody could control, especially the police. Locals were calling for the military and PM to intervene. But we knew what the outcry would be from that: r-a-c-i-s-m. So the gist is to just let the town die out. Or better still, let the Chinese nuke it along with Pine Gap."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Mate.... You literally asked what I did for the people of Alice Springs. I answered your question, that's what I was ""trying to achieve"""
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You are, you are bitching and moaning because people are doing the best they can from the place they live because they aren't packing their lives up and moving to alice springs. But yeah sure they are the enemy bro, lets not worry about the people actively pushing against any change for indigenous Australians."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,If you don't smoke or drink alcohol you're probably going to be safer than those who do. But there's still every chance of your shit getting broken into and stolen. Get an insurance quote for your vehicle with an Alice Springs address beforehand.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Worked a job that had me going through there pretty regularly, mostly during daylight hours, occasionally night-time. Daytime, it's the same as any small town. Most people trying to go about their day, using common sense to avoid trouble. Night-time is when more trouble happens, but as told to me by a fella who was a cop there for many years, ""Ignorance is bliss. Put the roller shutters down and don't think too hard about it."" Also important to note, the most common victims of Aboriginal violence is Aboriginal women and children. Yes, not all the violence and issues are within the Aboriginal community, but it's what visitors are worried about whether they say it or not. Beyond all that, I can truthfully say that Alice Springs, its people, and its surroundings, is easily one of my top 5 favourite places in this country. The natural beauty of the area cannot be overstated. Many of the locals are truly passionate about living there and share that passion in an infectious way. And for being the place geographically furthest inland that is inhabited in any substantial way, the sushi is actually pretty good!"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"So, without giving too much of my personal information away, I work for Parks Victoria, in a fairly specialised role that required me to do a bit of training in Alice Springs, at the Alice Springs Reptile Centre. As a non-indigenous, white man, I'll say this: The media like to blow the goings on in Alice Springs up as much as they can, simply because it gets attention and it sells column inches. There are established, genuine problems in Alice Springs, and pretty much everyone knows that, but it is nowhere near as bad as you'll see on 7 News. Would I go walking down the main Street with an ""Aussie Pride"", Pro-Colonization t-shirt with union jacks all over it on? Absolutely not Are you likely to get randomly mugged in the street? Also probably not. At least you're no more likely to get randomly mugged there than you are in any other big Australian city. As with anywhere, common sense is the key. Obviously don't approach anyone that's clearly intoxicated or clearly affected by drugs, it's probably not going to end well for you, no matter how much you might want to help. Otherwise, if you're not going out of your way to piss them off, they're not going to piss you off."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Hubby and I went as we did a road trip from Alice Springs to Uluru and back. In total stayed 3 nights in Alice and to this day it‚Äôs one of our favourite trips. There is nothing to do there but we enjoyed just walking around and driving around and exploring. At sunset the place is bloody incredible. HOWEVER, our hotel room was broken into by 2 women who were well known to the security there within 5 minutes of us putting our bags down. We also saw a girl get punched in the face by her boyfriend on the street. But we honestly never felt unsafe personally ourselves. Just don‚Äôt walk around after dark by yourself with belongings or do anything obviously stupid like that. Also when we went the shops were closed all day everyday - Woolies and 2 cafes were open but all other shops like the Kmart and shopping centre were closed. I‚Äôm not sure how it is now."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It‚Äôs slightly dodgy in that there‚Äôs a gang of teenagers causing merry havoc and trying to emulate hip-hop stars by making gangs and what not. Massive alcohol problem like most of the Northern Territory ‚Äì extreme poverty worsened by the collapse of whatever tourism was around with flights now directly going to Yulara rather than stopping by Alice Springs. You just have to be careful situationally ‚Äì Don‚Äôt leave valuables in your car, don‚Äôt wear valuables ideally when you‚Äôre walking and don‚Äôt really walk around at night time. The media does however blow everything up ‚Äì once you‚Äôre out of the walking distance of the teenagers, the rest of the area is absolutely stunning. The Western McDonald ranges in particular an absolute treasure with water holes hiking trails and ancient art. Absolute shame that people are missing out on them."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I've been here nearly two months and ive seen/heard nothing that wouldn't happen in Perth, where I'm from. Just be sensible and lock your shit up. If you like a drink or whatever, Alice Springs Brewery is the way to go. It's a little out of town so it doesn't attract a rough crowd."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I live there currently, moved down from Darwin at the start of the year, bit of common sense but it‚Äôs really not that bad as some people have said or what the media shows, I go out at day and night never felt unsafe, I travel a lot for work and there‚Äôs many other towns I‚Äôd not stay in over Alice Springs if that‚Äôs any help"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I spent a week there staying in a caravan park and loved it. The art industry is great, we ended up buying several pieces. Very young population, lots of international students, there seems to be people from all over the world, it‚Äôs very cosmopolitan considering where it is. Young girls jogging by the river, kids walking home from school, all quite normal. Yes a few blocks in the city near Coles and Woolworths where aborigines gather, and seem intoxicated, and they do wander into the nearby malls, yell at each other, but while we were there they didn‚Äôt seem to be causing trouble. That‚Äôs Alice Springs."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Alice Springs is cooked - anyone telling you otherwise is full of shit.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The most dangerous thing in Alice Springs would be coping with the bush flies in summer wouldn't it? I've never been, but recently talked about it with someone who lives there. She says it's completely safe. But there have been knife fights between youths there. On a scale of 0 being the safest city in the USA, South Burlington, Vermont. And 10 being the most dangerous city in the USA, Memphis, Tennessee.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I am originally from the rural Southern US. The area around where my family owns a property has had multiple homicide and suicides in the last 15 years. Lots of guns. Alice Springs is much safer, at least in terms of lethal violence."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Right? Australians....terrified of Alice Springs but want to visit the USA (where there is much more crime).
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,">Alice gets described as much, much worse than it is. And that's because, without getting too political, Australia has an inherent bias against First nations peoples, and as such, whenever any kind of negative news comes out of places like Alice Springs, it gets sensationalized, and it feeds back into people's preconceived notions and bias. The general attitude around Welcome to Country, and the comments sections on social media following an AFL game where one took place is all the proof you need to corroborate this. We talk about reconciliation and a pathway to unity. As someone that works with First nations peoples pretty much everyday, I can tell you that we are a hell of a lot further away than most people would like to think, and it almost entirely comes down to a lack of education, awareness, and the fact that people just don't want to be educated and don't care."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As someone who has lived in the NT for nearly three decades and who travels to Alice Springs for both work and to visit family- the town is going through a rough patch. My family that live there love it as do friends down there as well. There are places to camp, beautiful natural landscapes to see and more nature than you‚Äôll be able to comprehend. It‚Äôs green out there, not a desolate desert as people think. There are social issues there as any city has and if you aren‚Äôt careful those issues can impact you (buy a dog, lock your doors, secure your car). The sporting facilities are fantastic and the social support is great- plenty of clubs and associations.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Just come back from 12 days in Central Australia‚Ä¶ 8 of them in Alice Springs. Had a really great time. Went out at night to a few restaurants and bar/cafes. Went to the shopping strip. The Sunday Markets, OldTimers Markets, Todd River Race. A fabulous, worry free holiday. Everyone chilled. I was waiting for all the fear and terror to strike us that our racist media have promoted for others political advantage. Didn‚Äôt see any evidence. Not many Nomads which made parking easier as they suck in the same racist BS media that PHON and Murdoch use to flog their wares. Life still tough for many indigenous Aussies. Lack of jobs for young kids makes it hard for indigenous youth. Loved seeing the many aboriginal men and women selling their art at the many events over the time we were there. We came back with a great portfolio of canvases. My 24 year old niece doing a placement there for 10 weeks. She‚Äôs enjoying the environment and the challenges. But probably not a first place to come and stay upon moving to Australia. You need some lived in Australia for a while experience to tackle life in outback Oz."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I‚Äôve lived in Alice for nearly 30 years and my daughter was born and educated here. I now commute between Alice and Adelaide (school terms here, school holidays there!). Alice Springs Hospital: The maternity ward at ASH is exceptional. I also had my one and only surgery in Alice (recently) and could not fault the care I received. Schooling: My daughter did her schooling in town and finished high school with an ATAR of 99.7 (now a speech pathologist). I‚Äôm a teacher and can honestly say that my school is full of passionate and committed professionals who go above and beyond for kids. Sure, there are problems but I feel safer here than I did in Paris! Don‚Äôt do dumb stuff and secure your property (like you would anywhere).

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I think the culture shock of Alice Springs from the UK would be pretty extreme! Never mind the difference in terrain, weather etc Many Aussies find the Alice confrontating. I‚Äôd suggest come for a holiday first, see other parts of Australia as well as Central Australia and then decide. It might be a good jumping off point to permanent residency where you can move to where you really want to live"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My husband and I worked at the hospital for a year and lived there. We absolutely loved the hospital and alice springs, the only down side was the current crime issue. Which was a big one. While it wasn't as bad as it was being portrayed in the media, it was bad. I didn't feel safe unless I was at home, and even then we still got broken into (along with everyone else on our road). If you do move Id suggest investing the better areas (there's not really good suburbs, there's bad spots everywhere but some better than others) and be willing to invest in good security. If i was in the same situation id be hesitant to move there with 2 young children... but we did really love it when we were there. Id move there again if crime improved"

I went to Alice for a ‚Äúgood time not a long time‚Äù and I had a great time. But holy moly - I say some things at that hospital that I‚Äôve never seen again. It‚Äôs not about working a nice 9-6 office job and toddling back to your gated community. You will be at the coal face. Also people that live there can sometimes be like ‚Äòthe lobster in the pot‚Äô. They don‚Äôt realise, the big fences, the large family dogs, the built in routines for safety aren‚Äôt that normal everywhere else. I work in regional qld, my doors are only locked at night.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,DO NOT GO TO Alice Springs. The crime rate is insane.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"So first up, it's literally the middle of nowhere, I think the next town of any note is Coober pedy and that's about a 4 hour drive, in another state, north I think Darwin is the next real community of note, and that's probably 10 hours drive. Next is the cost of everything, buy something in Adelaide for $3.00 it's $5.00 in Alice springs due to transport issues. So basically will probably be 50% more expensive then elsewhere. Then finally, the locals, street view the city centre, those bars and reinforced windows exists for a reason! That reason is a small population of the locals, which ruin it for the majority. It has one of the highest rates per capita of car thefts, burglary, well, just crime in general, in Australia. Now it may be a great career opportunity, but with those 3 major points raised, I'm not sure it's good for raising a family. If I were single, yeah wouldn't think twice, but as a father and husband, the pay would have to be astronomical for me to move."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Lived there for four years working within health. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest it, especially not with kids. It‚Äôs expensive. It‚Äôs dangerous at night and lifestyle options are limited. We were never broken into but they definitely tried. I got sick of the filthy streets, community provisions (playgrounds, mall,shops etc) being destroyed, the constant closure of businesses, the abuse just walking down the street or thru the food court and always wondering if ‚Äútoday was our day‚Äù for our car being smashed into every time I left Yeperene shopping centre. The surrounding area is exquisite. Just beautiful. But it doesn‚Äôt make up for the stress of living there. Many are lifers and love it. This is just my experience.

Noped the fuck out after 6 months. Search around you'll find something else for sure. Especially with kids i wouldn't."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Fuck no x 1000.. Even people living in Alice Springs don‚Äôt want to be there
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I see you are a doctor. Having considered moving myself ten years ago and having other educator friends that did, I say don‚Äôt. If handling child abuse is really hard for you, Alice Springs has some of the highest rates of child abuse in Australia. Mostly inter family child sexual abuse and related child abuse like neglect. It‚Äôs a tough but prevelant reality and why many of the youth go on to have the out of control lives they do. It was an insanely confronting reality when my good good friend lived in the area for many years. Despite in both of our careers having dealt with handling child abuse."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Alice Springs really needs medial people. You‚Äôd be helping the town out a lot.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Moving to Alice Springs and living there is really challenging. But I‚Äôve heard that it can be very rewarding as well. But most of the people I‚Äôve read and heard stories from knew what they were signing up for, ‚Ä¶ and had familiarised themselves with local culture and history. The gap is big for Australians, it‚Äôs even bigger for foreigners. But not impossible. It‚Äôs not for the faint hearted On a different, more financial, perspective, ‚Ä¶ Northern Territory has the highest entry-level salary for medical professionals, but this is more to do with attracting people to the region. When it comes to senior/long-service positions, other states pay much higher. https://www.medshop.com.au/pages/nursing-salary-guide So if you‚Äôre at your early-career, are mentally and intellectually at your peak, and seeking a challenge then NT maybe worth considering."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I haven't been to Alice Springs since about 2004. It's the access point for tourism in the area.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,I think if more and more people who dont commit crime move to Alice springs it will bring the crime rate down.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I'd normally agree with that statement, but in certain cases, like this one, it may also be worth listening to people who are not from there but have visited. I've lived and travelled around the world, and have seen many interesting places. Some places, like Alice Springs (been there twice) or Bourke (been there once), are uniquely challenging, and people living there are either those that grew up there (and therefore can navigate those situations) or are those that moved there for specific reasons (or an adventure). For example, if someone who moved from Sydney to Alice for adventure or ""to find themselves"" says it's not so bad, I wouldn't say that was good advice for the ""typical"" person, especially those with young kids like OP."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Most people here are getting their info from the numerous stories of crimes. If they fact check themselves, they‚Äôll realise they were right.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,True.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Oh wow. I was travelling Aus recently and someone was warning about not going to Alice springs/that region because the people are dangerous, but would not elaborate on why. Which just seemed strange."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Yes. That is a fact! If you only look at the facts, you‚Äôll only find the truth.(truth being Alice Springs is incredibly dangerous to live in)"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,‚ÄúNever haven‚Äôt‚Äù is a double negative. I put to you that the educational opportunities in Alice Springs are woefully inadequate. I‚Äôve never lived there - nor would I ever visit.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,I visited Alice Springs and Ulu·πüu last year - the region is exquisite and well worth the visit (we didn‚Äôt encounter any issues). But the day to day life as a resident would be hard.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Not sarcasm. People who live in Alice Springs are more positive on the place that those who have never lived there and just join the hate fest
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Lost of Alice Springs locals in this thread are trying to convince themselves/OP that Alice isn‚Äôt all that bad, but it‚Äôs still important to realise it‚Äôs the most dangerous city. It seems clear among locals that it‚Äôs only dangerous if you‚Äôre also aboriginal, but that‚Äôs not true."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"How current is this ""barbaric"" practice and do the young men consent? Alice Springs' crime situation is very obviously a result of colonialism, as well as racism and inequality on both sides of the fence. As I said to pretend otherwise would be ignorant as well as idiotic, and people downvoting me are obviously either not getting it or just being Reddit like lol. Colonialism created the issue, decades and generations of both sides - indigenous and not - being racist toward one a other and having unequal opportunities and resources their whole lives entrenches all the issues."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Went to 1st year high school in Alice Springs in 1954. Very different then. We'd camp sometime in the Todd River along with numerous Aboriginal family groups. On weekends a group of us from the United Church Hostel, Griffith House (now the sites of Woolworths supermarket) would ride our push bikes out to Jesse Gap - sometimes came across Albert Namatjira sitting unsder a tree performing on of his stunning paintings. No violence or youth crime that I can remember. Special time for me really."

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Alice Springs exists so you can bounce on through ‚Ä¶
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Based purely on the name without having done research (""Springs"") you could imagine if formed around an oasis in the desert that people needed to stop at when going cross country. Tbh though man this is an easy chatGPT question: ChatGPT response: Alice Springs exists mainly because it became an important stopover and service point in the middle of Australia ‚Äî basically halfway between Adelaide and Darwin ‚Äî for both communication and transportation. Here‚Äôs how it happened: * **Telegraph Line**: In the 1870s, the Australian Overland Telegraph Line was built to connect Australia to the rest of the world via undersea cable from Darwin. They needed repeater stations every few hundred kilometers, and Alice Springs (then known as Stuart) was chosen as one because it had a semi-reliable water source nearby (the Todd River and a waterhole called ""Alice Spring""). * **Cattle and Exploration**: Around the same time, pastoralists (cattle ranchers) started moving into Central Australia. Alice Springs became a base for them because it was one of the few places with access to water and supplies. * **Railway**: Later on, it also became a stop on the Central Australia Railway (the old ""Ghan""), which made it even more important for trade and travel across the continent. * **Military**: During World War II, the town exploded in size because it was a major staging area for troops moving to northern Australia. So basically, Alice Springs is there because of **communication needs**, **cattle**, **transport**, and **war** ‚Äî all in the middle of a desert!"
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Maybe the question should be Why does Alice Springs still exist today?
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Fun fact: Alice Springs is also roughly halfway between the South Pole and Beijing.
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,I had a very different experience when I went to Alice Springs for year 10 camp during high school in 2006. Our bus pulled up next to a park and the first thing I saw when I stepped off was an Aboriginal man laying on his back in the grass wanking in broad daylight.
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,‚ÄúProvided with all of their needs via government funding‚Äù? You appear to be unaware that a significant proportion of the Aboriginal-specific services in Alice Springs (like the rest of the NT) are funded by mining royalties and land lease agreements. The fact that the government collects these funds and distributes them to Aboriginal community controlled organisations to administer does not make them ‚Äúgovernment funding‚Äù.

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I now feel privileged to have mixed with Namatjira. He was always prepared to sit and explain his paintings to a bunch of boisterous pubescent white boys who by default were not all ways accepting of Aboriginal culture but Namatjira was by his patience & understanding able to sway them. It was interesting that Namatjira wandered around the outskirts of Alice Springs as he came from Hermansberg which is about 125km from Alice. I grew up in Katherine when the population was 600. Today its 10,800 ‚ÄºÔ∏è Fun times really & I learned something of Aboriginal culture as a child and in later life I became a Patrol Officer in PNG where I grew close to a number of Papua Newguineans with whom I remain in contact."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The left doesn't want policy attention to focus on Alice Springs because it sees it as an existential rebuttal to its entire worldview about privilege, and the ability of government spending to fix social problems.

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Thank you for acknowledging what non-Indigenous people constantly ignore when discussing crime in Alice Springs - much of the conflict that‚Äôs bundled under the pan-Indigenous label ‚ÄúAboriginal violence‚Äù is actually inter-tribal and between groups from outside Arrente country. This would be much clearer if the media would use the nations or language groups of the people involved rather than reporting lazily on eg ‚Äúa brawl erupting between Aboriginal men‚Äù.
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Every time there‚Äôs a thread on Alice Springs in this sub, I read through the comments and all I can imagine is an elephant standing in the middle of the room with ‚ÄúNTER‚Äù painted on its side that everyone just refuses to even acknowledge"

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The ""intervention"" was only implemented for a couple of months before Rudd won the election and it got repackaged by Jenny Macklin as ""Stronger Futures"". The quality/completeness of the crime data in Central Australia was (and remains) absolutely shocking. It has always been hampered by the fact that groups living in Alice Springs report/ don't report certain types of crime at staggeringly different rates. The ""higher crime rates are bad because crime is bad"" vs ""higher crime rates are good because it's actually just an increase in reporting rates which is what we need to solve the underlying issue"" is a debate that has been going back and forth in this area (and others) for decades. I don't know what the answer is. I strongly suspect there actually is none. But no matter the true position, I think it is a very shallow view to put much blame for the misery of Central Australia on left or right wing politics."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I live in Alice Springs so my experience based perspective is a bit skewed but I agree, alcohol is the biggest issue nationwide and from my view (as someone who prefers a joint over a beer), the most hypocritical one."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Of course it didn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs an incredibly strong body of evidence about the social determinants that increase the vulnerability of children to abuse and neglect and the NTER worsened every single one of them, *while also* decreasing a number of other metrics of quality of life. The NTER was an abject failure both in its stated aims and in broader social consequences outside its identified scope. The only metric by which it *did* succeed, from the perspective of the federal and NT governments, is that substantially more NT land is under government control than before 2007. I understand why users of this sub have a vested interest in ignoring the negative impacts of the NTER on the population of Alice Springs and the rest of the NT but I have absolutely no idea what you hope to gain by pretending you think it was a well designed piece of policy in any way fit for its stated purpose"
Reddit/howislivingthere,Alice Springs Desert Park,I would recommend watching a YouTuber named Spanian on Alice springs gives a good idea on what the town is like in the night and also gives light on the racism towards aboriginals
Reddit/howislivingthere,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Just a few seperate news snippets: ""A 17-year-old charged over a violent home invasion in Alice Springs that left a baby with a fractured skull has been arrested after breaching bail.""

Reddit/howislivingthere,Alice Springs Desert Park,"this is why they lost, they left alice springs during the finale"
Reddit/howislivingthere,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Honestly, it's the truth and there's no way to sugar coat it. The indigenous people had colonisers attempt to force their way of life onto them, obviously the indigenous people didn't assimilate (and they shouldn't have to) but due to the alcohol and the fact that they genetically can't handle it there's extreme levels of violence in Alice Springs. Theres a user up the thread who had their first comment downvoted heaps but in other comments they explain the nuances of the situation much better than I can. It's incredibly sad and the issues have been caused by our government, going back generations."
Reddit/howislivingthere,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Worded harshly but right despite the downvotes, I'll explain a bit though. Many Aboriginals that have their own communities kick out their unruly, who would then move to Alice springs. There used to be a very large community of these ""outcasts"" by the riverbank. So this is another factor that contributes to the crime."
Reddit/howislivingthere,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Honestly, although its easy to point out the issues and cruticize, its harder for me to actually point out a solution, partially due to the fact that i am not super familiar with the systems of land ownership and even rule of law or social hierarchy in traditional communities or outstations. I would love for an aboriginal who lives in one of these communities to be part of the coversation. But the level of violence that aboriginal communities experience and that others in the outback are subjected to as a result is very destructive and beginning to be a subject of national embarrasment. I heard a story of an italian backpacker that was machete'd to death for telling a group of aboriginal youth to pick up their litter (somewhere in north queensland i believe?) Since foreigners see australia as a very safe country, thry are much less likely to be ""streetwise"" in situations like this when visiting certain areas of the country in order to avoid being victims of semi random violence. There's no doubt that the rise of social liberalism in bigger australian metropolitan areas and the switch from seeing aboriginals as savages to doing land acnowledgements and venerating some sort of sanitized version of their culture (almost viewing them as ""noble savages"") has somewhat emboldened aboriginal youth to commit crimes against european australians as some sort of ""revenge"", causing increased racism against aboriginals by white people, with people bringing up the old native police, threatening to bring back their ""grandfather's hunting licenses"", etc. The whole situation is getting more and more tense and being completely ignored, since the population densities of the outback are so low and everything is so isolated. The government needs to seriously look at the management of government funds by leaders in aboriginal communities, and punish those who embezzle them accordingly. It then needs to take a much more active role in making sure aboriginal youth attend regular education and have less access to alcohol and drugs, and put stricter punishments in place for violent offenders. There also needs to be greater investments in infrastructure and economic incentives to ensure aboriginals have places to work, which is difficult due to how isolated they are (the only real jobs are in cattle stations much of the time). Beyond that, it is a cultural issue. The importance of family groups, and fights between them, as well as the level of violence against others (and against women, which is abysmal) are cultural holdovers from the tribal days. There is no pretty solution here, which is why stealing the children and attempting to ""re educate"" them was attempted in the past (after the pastorialists had forced them off all the good grazing land, of course), but the reality of the present day situation is that, unfortunately, aboriginals have to assimilate to the settled way of life, which is something these groups have largely completely failed to do. Their complete reliance on government handouts has to change also (most of them do not work, another fact which causes resentment). I would love for a pure blooded aboriginal (not someone with 1/4 aboriginal blood, as the situation is likely very different for them) from the alice springs area to provide a better insight. In my time in australia, in the interior, i didnt have much of an opportunity to get any persectives like that unfortunately."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I grew up in Alice Springs. The place has changed SO MUCH since I was a young kid growing up there. I had to leave, I could not see myself staying there. Most of my friends (90%+) who I went to school with have also left. The town is in the process of dying a slow death. It's very sad but it's also very, very complicated there."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Welcome to Country. Unfortunately this experience you have shared is our day to day lives. The Todd mall you are remembering was that same place just a few years ago. That‚Äôs how quickly this has changed. Territorians have been screaming for help, asking anyone who will listen: leaders, ministers, radio jocks, interstate media and even the PM who came to town for a quick show. Nobody wants to help. This experience isn‚Äôt just Alice Springs either, but territory wide. It‚Äôs in Katherine, Greater Darwin, Wadeye, Tenant Creek, and more. The saddest part of your post is the comment about the police. Unfortunately there is nothing that they can do. Move them on? To where. Lock them up? Jails are full. Watch house? That‚Äôs full too. There are not enough cops on the beat in Alice Springs or Darwin. There is so much crime on a nightly basis, and not enough cops that it is out of control. Nobody wants to say that though. The police can‚Äôt do a thing, they have lost the power. The threats and assaults they are receiving on a nightly basis are unsustainable to anyone‚Äôs job. That‚Äôs why we have no police. There is no support. They can‚Äôt do their jobs. I don‚Äôt think they want to do their jobs. Would you? Territorians are scared, no one wants to do anything that might rock the boat or have you branded a racist for trying to make a change. This is not the same Northern Territory anymore. We have lost faith in the Territory Government, and our Chief Minister. Maybe something will change when someone gets killed? Oh wait‚Ä¶..nope."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I wouldn't blame the cops. The net effect is exactly the same whether they stop him or not. The justice system is beyond broken. Why arrest him and risk physical harm to yourself and be acused of police brutality and systemic racism? You already know your own police service won't back you up even when attacked with lethal weapons (see Zach Rolfe). And really why bother when he would be out threatening people in a few hours anyway, let out by some bleeding heart judge who is just serving time in alice springs in the hope of getting a promotion into a bigger city? Alternatively, you could just enjoy your coffee and go home to your family uninjured with the hope of leaving Alice Springs in a few years in a promoted position in a city after you've done your regional time. You get paid either way."

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,- The airport at Yulara (Ayres Rock Resort) was upgraded and with the advent of low-cost carriers people could feasibly fly to Yulara to visit Ulu·πüu over an extended weekend rather than drive for days with nothing to see. - The cost of fuel has also made the cheap Jetstar flight more attractive than a road trip. - Alice Springs is feral. Apparently it‚Äôs gotten even worse since I was up that way a few years ago. - Not entirely related to Alice Springs itself but 60% of visitors to Ulu·πüu pre-2019 were Japanese. The Japanese visited purely to climb it so when the climb closed that market dried up. It was also the reason so much notice was given (18 months IIRC). I drove Japanese tourist buses and on days the climb was closed we would sweep the climb point to see if they had reopened it ‚Äî strong winds was the most common reason given for closure.

Aboriginal culture is not fit for purpose. There is no hierarchy. Elders are a myth. There is no disciplinary structure beyond alcohol and drug fuelled bashing and payback. The youth are the biggest victims. No role models and being fed pie in the sky 'cultural' propaganda gives them no tools to thrive in modern society. They are bored. They see their metropolitan counterparts on Tik Tok experiencing the many things that a city with services and opportunities can offer. Living in these 'failed states' is depressing.

Before Spanian played the big man tripling the grog order and bemoaned alcohol restrictions he might have stopped in that 'town camp' and asked some women there what they thought of him loading up their men with grog. maybe the next time he visits he can take his camera down to the hospital emergency room on a Saturday night."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Oh people know and have been ""woken up"" to what's happening in Alice Springs for a long time now. It used to be a nice, pleasant place to take your family for a holiday. Now you don't go there unless you're a cop doing your rotation in a rural community. The problem is that it's a lose-lose scenario. If the government jumps into Alice Springs to police the streets and make it safe again (as it has already tried), it gets accused of being a police state and locking up Indigenous Australians. If the government does nothing, it gets accused of ignoring Indigenous Australians. And no amount of money poured into this community will ever fix its problems."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Yeah I feel bad for the good people (of all races) trying to live in Alice springs..your literally in a piss up hell hole, and if you try to make it safer for ANYONE your labelled a racist. I remember when their was an inquirey in to aboriginal communities because the rape and pedophillia was rampant. The media got a hold of it and turned it in to a 'stop the forced closure of aboriginal communities.' which is so bloody disengenous its not funny.."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,There wouldn't be many in Alice Springs cashing royalties cheques. More a welfare town.
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"How do you teach better behaviour without being accused of paternalism, colonialism, assimilation, destroying culture? Alice Springs is a doomed town. The people capable of maintaining the infrastructure, systems, commerce are leaving. Decolonisation in action."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Was the vote going to use a voice that is one of these fellas from the Alice Springs? Fuck no. We aren't dumb brother we all know that they were going to use an indigenous liberal upper class woman to represent the entire community by saying useless platitudes but pocketing millions from media displays and interviews and passing laws. Even the aboriginal groups here knew what was up and didn't want that at all.. Yet you know who did?...white upper class people in Canberra voted overwhelmingly yes. More of the same to make it look like we are doing something when really it's to sew more division. Nah I'm right thanks
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Because the police just stand around doing absolutely nothing and no one wants to defend themselves because they'll look racist. It's easy to avoid getting bashed and robbed, if that happens to you then you have 0 awareness. Alice Springs isn't that bad, everything I've seen in that spanian video I've seen happen in Sydney it's not that different, it just happens to more of an extent."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Yeah however that's a whole different ballgame compared to Australia. Find me a cartel in Alice Springs that chops heads off people and kills their whole family if they cross them. Venezuela is completely different. Alice Springs would be a walk in the park compared to Caracas and the rest of Venezuela.
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's important to remember that for years the media was gaslighting anyone who raised concerns about Alice Springs, calling them racists trying to create a crisis for the purpose of politics. Now even the media can't deny what's going on. So how did it become an 'emergency'? Through years of neglect and denial. &#x200B; ""There's aren't issues at Alice Springs. It's still the holiday paradise it was in the 70s"". ""Ok, there is some violence but they're just bad apples"" ""Ok, there's a few isolated incidents but it's not a pattern"" ""Ok, there's a bit more violence but nothing to concern yourself about"" ""Ok, there's a crisis and here's why it's other people's fault"""

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Look. The Aboriginal people have told us for years that they want to handle themselves.. make their own decisions abd lead their life their own way.. That *white* people interfering and *white* policing and *white* social norms etc etc etc...are the problem and we are making it worse. So why are we doing it? Why not ask these people where they want to live? Assume those people living on the fringes in Alice Springs & camps, come from other places?? So, offer to transport them to where they want to live / be amd let them run their own lives. Sending in more and more police & armed forces etc? They say that's wrong and they don't want to be stood over. They just get worse the more we try to help them. So let it go. I guess it's possible Alice Springs will collapse? Die? So be it. It's dying because of what's going on anyway. Aboriginals want to be in control of themselves? Let them do that"
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Some studies show that harsher punishments leads to repeat offenders, then you have the whole racial component with places like Alice Springs, and you create a perfect storm.

Not every culture or situation is the same, so you can't apply the same blanket stance."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,ABC have been willifully blind about Alice Springs. And they would have a bigger contingent of journalists there then all others combined.

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,I dont think it‚Äôs fair to say what‚Äôs happening in Alice springs represents Aboriginal culture as a whole
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"it's much easier to ""take responsibility"" when you get a decent start in life. have a listen to what the principal of this is decades in the making from the way successive Australian governments (and voters) have treated the problem Gavin Morris is the principal of Yipirinya school sets it out well... - 17 town camps surrounding Alice Springs have diabolical living conditions, and that needs to be addressed - local leaders and Aboriginal service providers need to step up immediately - implement a child protection system, which is fluid, culturally appropriate, and nuanced to the Alice Springs community"
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is simply untrue. Compare the per capita crime rates of Alice Springs to Sydney or Brisbane and come back to me.
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I guess you've never been to Alice Springs. It's not Sydney or Melbourne; I'm not going out on a limb when I say that the vast, vast majority of brown skinned people are aboriginal, and when it comes to teenagers in groups on the street at night it's virtually a guarantee."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs can be a tricky one. It was beautiful when I travelled for work, but there is a lot of disadvantage and walking down the Todd Mall you will see the impacts of that. Stay at the Crowne Plaza if you can, it's got gates that require room keys to access. But will still have signs on the back of your room door that anything stolen is not their liability, so don't bring anything precious if you can avoid it. If you do, make sure you're ready to set up an insurance claim (have receipts etc.). There is a restaurant and casino on site there but both are fairly bleak. The Double Tree by Hilton next door also has a phenomenal Asian restaurant called Hanuman, and could also be a good place to stay but I can't vouch for it specifically. There is a great Italian restaurant in town called Casa Nostra with, I think, the best vanilla slice I've ever had in my life. Don't walk near the Todd River. Don't go anywhere by yourself. EDIT: coming back to add that maybe you could do a tour instead? That's probably much safer and you'll see more because you'll be in a secure vehicle. Try Intrepid, they have several options for Central Australia."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I would push more time into the places outside Alice Springs like Yulara which is where you can stay if you want to visit Uluru, and I would focus on driving around Kata Tjuta, Kings Canyon and spend only a day or so in Alice if that, and even then just use it as a landing space to go do some travel. Way back, I went on a helicopter ride from Alice Springs and it was one of the most memorable things I've done in my life. The landscape is amazing."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs has many issues for sure but I spent a great 2 days there and 2 in the West McDonnell Ranges before heading to Yulara and Uluru. We actually stayed at the YHA hostel (a bit grimy but ok) where they played movies each night and organised for us to go to a kangaroo orphanage. The walk out to the Telegraph Station is nice and we found some good pub food. Yes it was confronting at times (we are white Aussies from Melbourne) but if you just stick to the main parts, keep alert and use your instincts you‚Äôll be fine."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was born in Australia and have travelled extensively around the country, and Alice Springs is the only place I haven‚Äôt felt safe in, even during the day time. I‚Äôve been to shitty areas in major cities which were fine during the day. That said, the danger could probably be managed by staying at a nice hotel and avoiding spending time outside at night. I wouldn‚Äôt bother spending 5 days there though. So many other nicer places to go in Australia. If you want to see the desert etc. a couple of nights would be enough."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Wow, I'm finding this all really odd! I went to Alice Springs for a week in 2021 as a single mum with two tween daughters. We walked happily around town and didn't feel unsafe at all, caught public transport. Stayed in two different average motels, one in a suburb and one in the middle of town. Went out for dinner at night, all fine. I think you'll find enough to do, the desert nature park is excellent and if it has reopened the evening tour is amazing (it wasn't open in 2021 but was when I went in 2013, when I also spent an early evening crying in the banks of the Todd River after a fight with a friend who I was staying with and still felt safe, even when approached by groups who just wanted to check that I was ok) the day and evening openings are compelling different so do both. Check the times of the bird shows etc because they are great. The reptile park was good if you are into that. Kids loved holding the snakes etc. I didn't do any of the technology stuff this time but have previously gone to the telegraph station, school of the air and the flying doctors head quarters, all great if they interest you. And day trips out to the McDonnell Ranges are a must."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Your company‚Äôs have started to remove Alice Springs from their activities, due to the growing out of control violence.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I am surprised at comments (and then reading up on it) how dangerous Alice Springs is. I was clearly lucky/oblivious as I didn't feel unsafe there, I went in 2018, it seems it did get worse after 2022 but still. We didn't go far at night or staying out late, but we did go out for dinner near out ostel once or twice. We stayed in a hostel called Jump Inn which I liked, it was nice by hostel standards but obviously not comapred to hotels. We mostly did organised tours, a 3 day one of Uluru, camel riding, Kangaroo santruary, and we cycled to see the School of the Air, which is the remote school for kids living too far to travel for primary school. We also did a day hiking trip. I would have loved to go to Hermmansburg but we were in the wrong season, we did have a look at some local art galleries. I spent 7 days there filled the time pretty easily. I would not have wanted to be driving myself to all these places just because everything is very far and the drive would get a little repetive and time consuming. The tours included buses which was good as we could look around but also leave early and nap on the way."

Reddit/geography,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Lived in Alice Springs for two years, as a backpacker working in hospitality. Landed there after traveling around Australia for two years. I fell in love nearly instantly. It's the first place where I actually saw and got to talk with Aboriginal, and got to share a bit of culture and view on life. It has been hard for me to do so before Alice Springs. However, there's a big divide between them and the ""white"" locals that was sometimes shocking, with that bar that for example had an entrance for the white and one for the black fellas, and the inside room being divided in two as well. Lots of stories of crime, and everybody there knows about someone who had issues coming back late at night. Most of the crime though is perpetrated by kids and teenagers who are lost and not really cared for by their parents, or that is at least what I understood and got from conversations. It shows the impact colonization had on the populations here. Alcohol seemed to be a big issue, and I even experienced a semi-ban on it. You'd be limited to a certain amount per person per week, and they'd check your ID every time you'd buy some. On the other hand, one of the most diverse place in terms of humans I've ever seen. Strong Asian communities, lots of backpackers, kiwis and pacific islanders, Australians both locals and from other states, queers and bogans, quirky elders and dynamic young people. But above all, and insane sense of community. Everybody being welcoming, sharing stories, giving tips and helping moving in, moving out, finding jobs or just attending regular and unregular events equally with enthusiasm. Tourists melting in every now and then for big events like Finke or the Larapinta trail winter season. The bush is beautiful, ochre red with patches of green here and there, hills and valleys. Occasional big rains will make the Todd flow for a week or so if you're lucky, and leave the outback green and verdoyant for a month or more after that. People say you're a local if you see the river flow three time actually. And then, all year long, water holes are little haven hidden between red rocks where people adventure to get a swim and escape the town for a day or two if they like camping. Honestly, a magical place that leaves no one neutral. Go there with an open mind and heart and you'll truly be surprised by the life of ordinary people there. Love and kisses to my Alice fellas"

Reddit/geography,Alice Springs Desert Park,"https://youtu.be/YGz1Tiaying?si=MLEaWGPP36oQhYvz I am a geography nerd and last year I became fascinated with Alice Springs. Even though it is a dot in the middle of a desert, it may as well operate as an island due to the difficulty in getting resources to the city as well as attract people to support/combat the ongoing issues there. Kinda boils down to historical mistreatment of indigenous folks combined with drug/alcohol abuse. The video I‚Äôve linked (I thought) did a good job of impartially highlighting the issues around Alice Springs in an impartial manner. A good watch if you‚Äôve got time."
Reddit/geography,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I am currently working in an Indigenous community in South Australia (SA). Once a month, we usually travel to Alice Springs for grocery shopping and other necessities. It is an interesting place, largely because of its remoteness. As has often been pointed out, it is difficult to attract people to live and work there. especially for jobs considered ‚Äúmenial‚Äù or less specialized. For example, as a Canadian citizen on a Working Holiday Visa, one of my options to extend my stay in Australia beyond one year (for two or even three years) is to complete specified work in the Northern Territory (NT) in the service industry in places like Darwin or Alice Springs. This requirement means that I am far from alone: many Working Holiday Visa holders find themselves in Alice Springs, making it a surprisingly international town despite its isolation. At the same time, Alice Springs faces a complex social reality. Australia‚Äôs colonial past was devastating for its Indigenous peoples. Through violence, dispossession, and policies aimed at assimilation. Unlike in many parts of the country, the Anangu people survived largely because they lived deep within Central Australia‚Äôs desert lands, which were difficult for settlers to exploit. Today, the Anangu remain very much present and active in their communities and culture. Yet serious challenges persist. Education is particularly difficult to deliver in such remote areas. Access to everyday services and infrastructure ; ** things most Australians take for granted ** is often limited or absent ; We had to close the school due to vicious dogs attacking people. I once couldn't get my click & Collect order at Coles (grocery store) because someone died there a few days prior. Many communities struggle with high rates of unemployment, alcohol and substance abuse, and what was once widespread petrol sniffing. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians in very remote areas is more than four times higher than for non-Indigenous Australians. Life expectancy remains about 8 years lower for Indigenous people compared to the national average. Trying to undo more than two centuries of colonial dispossession is a task that remains extremely challenging."
Reddit/geography,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a taboo topic, but I'll attempt a straight answer without getting into the ""why"": Alice Springs has a large Aboriginal population, which suffers from extraordinarily high rates of unemployment, poverty, alcohol and drug abuse. This in turns drives violence and crime, much but not all of it within the Aboriginal community (eg. rates of domestic violence are through the roof). This has been the case for decades. What's new is gangs of preteens, many of whom suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome, brain damage from sniffing glue etc, who have effectively no adult supervision and roam the streets breaking into cars and houses, robbing people, etc, and the police and justice system are very limited in what they can do in response."

Reddit/PublicFreakout,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's a very touchy subject. Alice Springs has a very high population of Indigenous Australians while also having very serious issues with crime and violence, mostly due to that particular demographic. People don't take it well if you lay the blame on them though due to white people coming in and taking their country from them followed by years and years of actual and systemic racism which resulted in less than ideal outcomes for these people in modern day society. You can't really make a ""black people behaving badly"" story out of it without viewing their current social issues through a centuries long lens of discrimination and oppression."

It's not racist to want to minimize your exposure to violent crime. Those statistics IGNORE race, gender, religion and background, and I never inferred elsewise. You can call me racist all you want, but your comment ignores the hard fact of the harshness of reality for the NT's cities and fails to address the core issues that they face.

It's a transient town by nature so we've seen plenty of good friends come and go, but a lot of people settle down here for a long time. If you want to meet enthusiastic people and have the patience to slow down your expectations then Alice Springs could be for you. You're going to hear opinions that are the exact opposite of what I'm telling you because some people just do not fit in well with the lifestyle.

In particular it‚Äôs not the Prime Minister business because he doesn‚Äôt govern everyone in Australia. Not at all.

It is understood the person being arrested in the picture is currently facing charges. NT Police refused to comment last night and said they would not confirm the identity of the officer involved in the Tuesday arrest as the investigation was continuing.

Assistant Commissioner Travis Wurst also declined to comment about the extent of force used to subdue the deceased man or the ‚Äúspecifics‚Äù of what transpired during the arrest at a press conference on Wednesday, citing the ongoing investigation. Witnesses quoted in other media reports claimed the plain clothes officer put his knee to the back of the man‚Äôs neck and head before he lost consciousness, describing the arrest as ‚Äúviolent‚Äù.

Anyone living in the NT, especially in Alice Springs, knows that transport barriers and food insecurity are real challenges.

Did they even try to de-escalate?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis happened on the fifth anniversary of death of George Floyd ‚Äì during Reconciliation Week ‚Äì but my people have to confront another death in custody. My people are being routinely brutalised by police. We are going to jail in record numbers ‚Äì men, women and children alike. ‚ÄúWe cannot tolerate the situation, with continued brutality and lack of respect. We will be calling for action from supporters to demand accountability, justice and self-determination. The deaths and the racism need to stop.‚Äù Political leaders have urged the community to remain calm as the investigation progresses. It is unclear what rank Mr Haig was serving in, but as a constable in 2009 was awarded a commendation for ‚Äúoutstanding self-discipline and personal courage‚Äù for his actions relating to a fire at a block of residential units on Kempe Street. Multiple sources who know Mr Haig described him as an ‚Äúold school cop‚Äù who had faced disciplinary action in recent years for use of force and other matters. A police source said the incident is likely to be ‚ÄúZach Rolfe 2.0‚Äù, referring to the shooting death of Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu during an attempted arrest in November 2019, that garnered national attention and stoked racial tensions in the Northern Territory. Mr Rolfe was charged with murder and later acquitted in the Supreme Court. Coroner Elisabeth Armitage conducted a more than two-year long inquest into the shooting death of Mr Walker and is scheduled to hand down her findings in Yuendumu on June 10, with the inquest examining the extent of systemic racism in the NT Police force. NT Courts said yesterday the Coroner was still planning to attend the community, but indicated it did not know ‚Äúwhether the recent events will affect these plans‚Äù."
Reddit/darwin,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I agree but there‚Äôs people suggesting that he was just doing his shopping and two cops decided to kill him are ignoring the fact that he had been dumped in Alice Springs by his family after repeated violent assaults, had no carer with him and was attacking a security guard when restrained."
Reddit/darwin,Alice Springs Desert Park,"No one has said that it's OK that he died and he wasn't ""killed"".

Reddit/darwin,Alice Springs Desert Park,Yet the circumstances leading to it are still being ignored. He was dumped in Alice Springs by his own community due to ongoing violent assaults what did they think was going to happen. Instead of making assumptions the cops were actively trying to kill him why not address the fact that his carer was nowhere to be seen and he had attacked two people prior to being restrained. Yes the whole thing needs to be investigated but you‚Äôre leaving out any responsibility for the people that allowed it to get to this point.
Reddit/OldPhotosInRealLife,Alice Springs Desert Park,"c Jan 1941. An Australian soldier looks over Alice Springs, Central Australia The Japanese were identified as a threat to Australia in 1920 but it wasn‚Äôt until 1940 that this translated to men on the ground here. From Alice Springs and up ‚Äòthe track‚Äô to Darwin they worked to improve the roads and infrastructure for defense. By Feb 1942 the bombs started raining down on Darwin, and Alice became a staging post for men and equipment heading North. The railway from the South and East coast stopped in the Centre of Australia and hundreds of trucks dragged freight and men the other thousand miles to the North coast. At the peak of the war 5 trains per day were unloaded. The initial 700 men and 150 trucks in the Transport mob (Darwin Overland Maintenance Force) were soon doubled and re-organised as the ‚ÄòCentral Australian Motor Transport Column‚Äô With Mount Gillen in the distance, I did not have to scramble around the hills too long to find the location for this picture, all you need is a boulder with a vertical face, looking to the Southwest. However, to frame the shot accurately I had to come back a few times. photo from the War memorial https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C26962 There were up to about a dozen camps for enlisted men and those employed by the government‚Äôs Allied Works Council. Alice population was about 600 before the war and suddenly they needed power water and food for 5000 men. At the bottom of this hill to the left, just out of sight was the Royal Engineers‚Äô camp. There was a machine gun post in the rocks on this hill 60 metres behind the camera. A shitty old 1914-1918 Lewis machine gun as anti-aircraft defense was a rather bitter reminder that Australia was far behind in the race to fit out and equip her fighting men.

Reddit/todayilearned,Alice Springs Desert Park,I remember when we were planning our trip to australia and planned to stay just one night in Alice Springs before making our way down to Uluru. We spent the longest time on google maps debating how far to stay away from the Todd River so that we wouldn't have to put up with mosquitoes and bugs. Then we decided to use street view.....
Reddit/todayilearned,Alice Springs Desert Park,Shoutout to Alice Springs H3 and Katherine H3
Reddit/todayilearned,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Yes, that's correct! The Henley-On-Todd Regatta is a unique event held annually in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia. Instead of traditional boats, contestants carry bottomless boats, such as wheeled frames, and race them down the dry sandy bed of the Todd River. The regatta is a fun-filled day that includes various events such as boat races, sand shoveling, and even a hilarious 'boat' tossing competition. It is a popular event that attracts both locals and tourists alike. However, in 1993, the regatta was canceled due to the unusual occurrence of wet weather. The Todd River briefly flooded due to heavy rainfall, making the river unsuitable for the races. It was the first and only time the regatta was canceled due to wet weather. Despite its unique challenges and occasional setbacks, the Henley-On-Todd Regatta continues to be a beloved tradition in Alice Springs, showcasing the ingenuity, resilience, and sense of humor of the Australian outback."
Reddit/todayilearned,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I've been there twice. Second time I did a 15 day hike from Mt. Sonder to alice springs. Mosquitoes weren't the problem for us, its the flies. Omg there are so many why are there so many."
Reddit/todayilearned,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's actually a good idea to stay away from the river, because you never know... In 2008, I was living in Darwin, and I was the head of the lighting department for a staging company there. We trucked 4 shipping containers to Alice Springs for the Brolgas (the NT Tourism awards). When we started unloading the containers at 8am, it was already 35 degrees, and the containers were sitting about 150 metres away from the loading door of the venue, which was uphill on black bitumen. It hit 45 degrees at about 10am, and the 8 of us went through 40 litres of iced powerade mix in three hours. Good thing we had a forklift to get everything up the hill and into the venue. So we started setting up, and at about 3pm I went outside to have a smoke. It was still 45 degrees, but in the ten minutes it took me to have my cigarette, the temperature dropped to 12 degrees, and a massive storm hit. It was wild. Dark as night, lightning, absolutely pissed down with rain. The Todd River flash flooded. 3 people died, because they were sleeping off their lunch booze in the shady river bed. They say that if you see the Todd River flowing three times, you're considered to be a local. I've seen it once, and while my arsehole points to the ground I will NEVER go back to Alice Springs, because I don't want to risk seeing it flowing two more times and be considered a local of that fucking shithole."

Spent a few weeks in spring (locally for Aus) living with family in Sydney, and while I was down there we went for a camping tour thing in the outback, flying in through Alice Springs from Sydney.

Still have pictures on my computer of surprisingly lush yellow grass growing up from red sand, with a blue sky and scattered green trees. It was a weird if very cool visual."

Reddit/todayilearned,Alice Springs Desert Park,This guy has never been to Alice Springs
Reddit/todayilearned,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Honestly Alice Springs amazes me. Mybe a year ago I got curious about that big rock and was wondering if it was much of a tourist attraction and how close it was to the nearest city. That‚Äôs when I learned how large and mostly empty Australia is. In American terms Alice Springs like a small town where Kansas City is but the nearest town of of similar size or larger is on the coast. I have driven around 900 miles across a portion of America a number of times. Every 5 to 10 miles, or sometimes as much as 20 miles, there are a gas stations and restaurants. I can‚Äôt imagine doing that trip to get to or from Alice Springs and not being able to stop to get supplies. I‚Äôm from a pretty average size state, not too large and not too small. Using thetruesize.com I was shocked to discover that I could drop my whole state into a portion of Australia and not have it contain any roads or towns. Then I looked a bit to the west and found a region I could drop my state into *twice* and not contain and roads or town. It‚Äôs hard for me to imagine being in a civilized country but that far from civilization."
Reddit/todayilearned,Alice Springs Desert Park,"> I can‚Äôt imagine doing that trip to get to or from Alice Springs and not being able to stop to get supplies. There are strategically placed road houses for fuel and supplies along the major highways, which are all paved, and the roads are usually pretty busy so you can flag down help if you need it. You'll want to make sure you have a least a few hours of fuel at all times though. On the not so travelled highways you can certainly get into trouble. > It‚Äôs hard for me to imagine being in a civilized country but that far from civilization. I think most foreign persons mistake the size and remoteness of most of Australia. Head a hour out of a major city and you might not even have any mobile coverage. And vice-versa for us. I was playing some Microsoft Flight Sim in a busy area in the US, and all I could see horizon to horizon was cities merging into other cities. There is *nothing* comparable to that in Australia. Sure we have twin cities, some new me such as Townsville and Thuringowa, Ipswich/Logan/Brisbane, but it's nothing like the US."

Read through this thread as for 2 days now I have been disgusted by this media stunt in Alice Springs which is an obvious anti Indigenous campaign to support the 'No' stance disguised as pro indigenous support... problem is it's so obvious to most except the racists which want/need that food. Then you have any comment in this thread that adds some reason and insight into the case of there are serious issues within Indigenous communities attacked blindly with ignorant logic. Is everyone these days black and white in their thinking? Watched on ABC yesterday another speaker more or less state the issues in Alice Springs of both crime and other matters is no different to many other communities and real. They all need more and better support. Both sides of Government have neglected many things far too long resulting in where this country is today in this regard. Whether the concerns raised are in data or neglected so they do not appear in data is not the factual reality ever... the truth is often a combination of data and reality. In either case the bottom line is that using such issues for a political anti Indigenous stunt is disgusting. The likely fact that crime and other serious matters are worse than what is actually reported officially just highlights both sides of Government have let this country down through popular politics. This media stunt in Alice also highlights the opposite of its intended false agenda in that a voice might actually help improve some of these issues or at least not let them be forgotten as easily when it is not politically useful.
Reddit/friendlyjordies,Alice Springs Desert Park,Absolutely spot on is Peter Dutton here.

Reddit/friendlyjordies,Alice Springs Desert Park,I've heard some pretty tragic stories from Alice Springs from nurses and health professionals of the amount of children brought in with tearing and bleeding from sexual abuse.

Reddit/friendlyjordies,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Aboriginals don‚Äôt commit that much sex crime in Alice Springs, can‚Äôt speak for anywhere else. The Sudanese, on the other hand‚Ä¶"
Reddit/friendlyjordies,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Lived evidence. I have spent most of my life living in high Aboriginal population areas including remote Northern WA. The issue of child abuse is absolutely well known and documented, it is absolutely tragic when kids literally 11 or 12 commit suicide and the police investigating knew they were being preyed upon but couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. I haven‚Äôt had experience of living around Alice Springs but from what I see there is no reason to assume the issue would not be prevalent there as it is in other failed communities. Also, an issue is that obviously very well meaning people straight away condemn any white person raising the issue as right wing or a racist. While obviously these people exist, a very large number of people who raise the issue do so out of genuine care for the children in harm‚Äôs way. If you‚Äôre interested I suggest reading about Roebourne in WA, nearly every child had been preyed on but little could be done to protect the kids. Over 50 know pedophiles are still in the community, still getting mindlessly drunk and taking their filthy urges out on either their own kids or kids of parents too drunk or drugged to care , or who just accept it. The truth is held down by these blind calls of racism that prevent real action."

Reddit/aviation,Alice Springs Desert Park,Actually Qantas did send their A380s to the US for storage.

Reddit/aviation,Alice Springs Desert Park,"No. I was browsing Flightradar24 one day earlier this year and noticed a line (5?) of Singapore Airlines A380s heading to Alice Springs. They have space. I believe the reason Qantas chose California for their A380s is that they have a maintenance base at LAX which isn't too far from where they're stored at Victorville. Sydney (and maybe Melbourne) airport is closed at night until 6am. Flights between the west coast of the US and Australia all follow a similar schedule: depart late in evening LA time (10p-12a) and arrive at Sydney just after opening (6-8a). This allows time for connecting passengers to arrive from across the US and accounts for SYD being closed at night. Flights from SYD to LAX depart late morning and arrive early morning in LAX, so the aircraft are at LAX for over 12 hours. Qantas decided to use this opportunity to do maintenance on their A380 and 747 aircraft and set up a maintenance facility at LAX."

No official archaeological surveys were conducted during its construction, and by 1984, the site was officially protected, preventing further excavation. Given the timing, secrecy, and underground expansions, the theory suggests that JGGRS may have been built over an immovable UFO, hiding it in plain sight."
Reddit/UFOs,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I‚Äôm deep into Australian UFO lore, I used to run QUFOSR. This has sparked a memory of a case from the same area and in the 50‚Äôs. Some guy claimed he saw a craft that was partly invisible and had a force field. When he returned it was gone and in its place was a government looking building. I‚Äôm sure he was located near Alice Springs but I‚Äôve spent the last 3 hours searching. Commenting so I have this to come back to and compare!

Below we have published a photograph claimed to be that of a ‚Äúflying saucer.‚Äù With the picture, the following note was pushed under the door of the ‚ÄúAdvocate‚Äù office. ‚ÄòFor several reasons, one of which is because I can hardly believe it myself I refuse at this stage to come forward and allow my name to be used. But study this picture of a flying saucer yourself. ‚ÄòI was taking a picture of Mount Gillen on the day that a number of Alice Springs people said they heard something strange pass over the town (Friday January 15). Suddenly an enormous round looking object appeared from behind Gillen. It went high then dropped to come down quite between the mountain and the town - it was not travelling fast at this stage - in fact it appeared to be almost hovering. That was when I took this picture - almost automatically. I focused and clicked the camera. It would have been possible to take more shots but I just looked, then suddenly the thing moved off very fast - it gained speed until it must have been travelling at terrific pace going high to the west. ‚ÄòI did not hear much of a whistling sound. The saucer looked to have been anything up to 150 feet across - I don‚Äôt know, maybe Adamski had something about those men from Venus.‚Äô The only comment that the ‚ÄúAdvocate‚Äù is prepared to make at this stage is that the picture could easily be a fake - on the other hand it one would have to go to considerable trouble to make it up.

Reddit/UFOs,Alice Springs Desert Park,">... or was it an attempt to reach something buried far beneath the surface? The story was that they constructed a building atop a 'crashed UFO'. What's with this ""far beneath the surface""? >In 1984, the Australian government officially protected the land surrounding JGGRS, preventing any further excavation. That would be expected if the facility really for seismic monitoring, though. I'm not saying this is all bunk; just that not all of the points here stand up. And some of them are just ridiculous: >The station‚Äôs urban headquarters in Alice Springs creates an illusion of openness, while the true activity occurs underground and in remote areas. I'm not paranoid, you are!"
Reddit/UFOs,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs‚Ä¶ The Aboriginal tribes saw the v-shaped UAPs millennia ago, flying thru the skies in their area and also returning. They even created boomerangs as representations of what they saw and created their own ‚Äútechnology‚Äù with it (the boomerang for hunting). Soundwave tech witnessed by them was eventually culturally absorbed as didgeridoos. Their paintings show the beings and orbs and saucers, and they absorbed that culturally as well. One crashed long ago or simply landed and later malfunctioned in some way, stranding it in place. The shifting winds and lands covered most of it very well over time, and when later discovered by the whitees, they figured they should bury their treasure until they could come back for it and exploit it in full. Much later, they put a building over it to fully secure it‚Ä¶ then a BASE to secure it even further and practically guarantee its safety and future utility."

Reddit/OldPhotosInRealLife,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Overland Telegraph Station was established in 1872. This photo was taken Around 1900. More like 1901 perhaps, as the Federation drought is setting in. The drought didn't break till 1903. This has all the look and feel of a classic Thomas Bradshaw picture. Bradshaw was Stationmaster here from 1899 to 1908. Mail came from Adelaide, 1000 miles to the South. Roughly 600 miles by train and the last 400 miles 2 or 3 weeks by camel or coach. Coach more often than not being an open wagon. The mail was by camel for much of the time. They could only use horses when there wasn't a drought, because of a lack of reliable wells, and there were many droughts through to 1929 when the train line was finally completed... It was around 1898 that the mail service had improved somewhat, from a six weekly service to a monthly one, and according to Stuart Traynor's notes (history guru).. Frank Gillen wrote his mate Spencer on 3 April 1898 with ‚ÄòThe mail leaves here tomorrow for the first time under the fortnightly new contract. Coaches are to leave here and Oodnadatta simultaneously, meet at Horseshoe Bend, exchange mails and return to their respective starting points. The previous Stationmaster from 1891-1899 Frank Gillen wrote ‚ÄúWells has, I am glad to say, sublet this end of the contract to a good man so that we have a chance of getting our mails regularly ‚Äì We shall receive replies to our letters monthly‚Äù - (My Dear Spencer pp. 211-212) The mail coach was a high-seated open buggy, not a stagecoach of the type used by Cobb & Co. Stagecoaches operated in outback Queensland but never on the Oodnadatta track. The four-weekly mail service between Alice Springs and Arltunga, the gold mining area East of Alice increased to fortnightly in 1899. Around this time there were about 300 white people at Arltunga and only a couple of dozen at Alice Springs. Alice Springs white population only got to 90 by the time the railway got here in 1929.

The problem with your argument is that you assume that there is only one step. ie Inflation immediately leads to babies being assaulted. The links I've given you show fairly clearly that babies being assaulted is likely to be 4-5 steps along. >*The problems with crime in the NT go back far further than covid.. many many years.* I absolutely agree with this. Yes there are areas in Australia and around the world where crime is higher, and places where crime is lower. But crime sometimes spikes upward. That is the case in Alice Springs. I believe you when you say that crime was always bad there, but I'm saying that crime has gotten worse in the last few years. And I've offered an explanation. You sound very angry at the situation in Alice Springs. Were you just as angry 5-6 years ago? If not, why are you especially angry now? Aren't you angry now because crime in Alice Springs *has gotten worse?*"
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I know someone who starts their racist tirades with ""I was a cop in Alice Springs for 10 years"". Being close to the problem doesn't automatically make you an expert on solving the problem and often makes you uniquely unqualified to maintain sufficient objectivity to offer real solutions. It's like asking prison guards to decide how inmates should be treated. That's supported by your vaguely ominous statements that people aren't going to like real solutions. What is that supposed to mean? You can dismiss the solutions suggested by the ""inner city latte drinkers"" because ""they don't know what it's really like"" but, in reality, how often are genuinely worthwhile solutions being properly executed, funded consistently, and then maintained beyond the term of the current government?"
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"""I was a cop in Alice Springs for 10 years"" - that person was probably racist before they got to Alice, and if not, pretty soon after, otherwise they wouldn't have fitted in.

I remember Los Angeles had a crime spike around the same period. Look at this: https://www.foxla.com/news/hate-crimes-los-angeles-county-reach-all-time-high-2023 So what could have caused a spike in crime in both Australia AND the United States?

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Cheap seat perspective, I take it you're from inner city melbourne. Disconnected and full of ""solutions"". I take your perspective would if you lived anywhere near Alice Springs."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's always vengeance?? That's untrue. As to your scenario -- if you could flick a switch and ensure someone would never commit another crime, although it'd be unethical to experiment on a human like that, of course you could set them free. We would no longer need prisons. Incarceration will stop someone from battering and raping for the time they are in prison. They might be worse when they get out or they might be better. Whichever way, the community deserves to be safe. of course, prisons should be rehab centres, not places of punishment. I recognised they are children in my post and said that prison is not appropriate for them. The issue is that the vast majority of children in Australia do not batter babies or commit armed robbery or rape people, so those things are not something children commonly do, and so to make a claim about undeveloped brains is sidestepping the actual issues. If we have issues that extreme, things have gone catastrophically wrong. You think no one should be in prison? That idea greatly benefits violent criminals (mostly men) and greatly disadvantages women and children. We need facilities that are not like current prisons but is aimed at rehabilitation -- while not allowing violent criminals free and while ensuring the community is safe. I'm using your terms when I mentioned ""serious criminal and violent thugs"". And I was careful to say that the children are ""acting as"" those things -- I did not say they ARE those things. My comments about FSD & FAE & abuse & drugs do indeed point to diminished capacity. I made mention of those things for that reason. But you still need to help those children while keeping the community safe. Alice Springs could become almost a ghost town if things continue, with the crime rate escalating among those who remain. Imagine that? An absolute cesspit where men, women and children are dying of crime-related reasons every single day, a place where everyone has experienced sexual abuse. Male elders have been empowered to solve issues in their own communities many times in the past, over and over. It hasn't worked. It simply isn't working. They don't have the skills or perspectives. That's why the solutions are going to come from Aboriginal women. The men will be included, but the women and children are bearing the absolute brunt of it, and the solutions must come from the women. As to your last point, as I said, children don't belong in prison. But the adults of those children concerned have repeatedly demonstrated they are not capable of taking care of their own children. They may be battling trauma, IPV, or/and alcoholism themselves, as well as struggling with the general issues within their communities. Those kids deserve to be safe and their communities deserve to be safe. As I said, something is needed that isn't prison but where kids acting in criminal ways can receive urgent help. Their families should be involved and able to freely visit, while also receiving help. Young kids cannot be roaming around at night. Young girls should not be getting pregnant. Bans on alcohol can be put into place/put back into place, and that needs to happen alongside consolation with the people involved. Alcohol is absolutely causing devastation. We need to prevent kids being born affected by it. I find it extremely sad when people state that children as young as ten shouldn't not be held criminally responsible for their actions as if that is an answer to anything. It is no answer. It holds no weight whatsoever. It provides no help for anyone. Of course children that young can't be criminally responsible, but what needs to be said is, what is the alternative? What should we be doing? And obviously, we should be doing a LOT. There needs to be programs where children committing very serious crimes young ages can be put into and receive intensive help alongside their families -- and, vitally -- work towards preventing these issues happening in the first place."

Our first step involves enhancing community policing initiatives, increasing engagement between law enforcement and local residents through workshops, town hall meetings, and collaborative planning. Empowering community leaders and groups to take an active role in safety measures can help tailor solutions that are culturally sensitive and locally endorsed. Pillar 2: Education and Prevention Programs Education plays a crucial role in prevention. This pillar focuses on implementing educational programs that promote non-violence, respect, and understanding among community members. We aim to work with schools, local organizations, and experts to develop curricula and community activities that address the root causes of violence, such as social inequality and lack of opportunities. Pillar 3: Strengthening Legal and Support Frameworks Enhancing the legal response to incidents of violence is essential. This involves not only stringent enforcement of laws but also ensuring that those affected have access to necessary support services. This includes legal aid, counseling, and health services that help victims and work towards rehabilitating offenders. Additionally, we'll advocate for more robust funding and support for local law enforcement to ensure they are well-equipped to handle these challenges. By implementing this three-pronged approach, we aim to create a safer, more cohesive environment in Alice Springs. https://preview.redd.it/kxrhgq3h4r2d1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a884037ffe79c3080d34153ec06644ebf9cd9dd"

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Careful..... You ask for a Royal commission into the crisis in Alice Springs and you'll get one - focused on discrimination by police and Aboriginal disadvantage.
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Got a warning for this. What a joke. Mainly recounting exactly what I saw while visiting Alice Springs, with an observation at the end. If they‚Äôre warning me for that they must be pretty busy with the rest of the posts."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Harsher penalties for young reoffenders. Acknowledgement that Aboriginal people can and do do bad things, and that their choices are their own and they should be accountable for them. Cut support to remote communities that are money sinks, shut them down. Relocation for the people in Alice Springs that are having to deal with this shit, let the mob have it."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Pretty sure you would only get called racist if you singled out the issue by race rather than address the underlying root issue. Now the underlying root issue may be related to racism. But it‚Äôs a similar conversation to ghettos in the United States. ‚ÄúWhy are prisons overwhelmingly populated by black people? Is it because black people commit more crimes?‚Äù To which the nuanced answer is, perhaps there is systemic racism in the laws or the application of the laws or the people in charge of enforcing the laws. As for the issue of Alice, I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious that there are systemic issues that could be fixed through better public services, better public programs and addressing wealth inequality while also rehabilitating and educating at risk and repeat offenders. But any time you try to have that conversation you get bombarded with ‚Äúwe keep just throwing money away and nothing is happening‚Äù it‚Äôs because things take time, and every program gets watered down and argued on and defunded until nothing CAN be done and we end up with huge inefficiencies and expensive messes. One well funded well organised and well structured initiative could fix the issues facing Alice Springs, and it certainly wouldn‚Äôt involve just incarcerating a bunch of people and calling it a day."

Yes it's interesting to see the empty outback - for about 5 minutes - not 4+ hours of it. There is an alternate route via Kings Canyon which is a point of interest but that takes even longer - okay if you stop overnight at Kings Canyon. My suggestion is to fly in and out from AYQ, but take three days there and drive to Kata Tjuta for one of the days. Do rent a car so you're not stuck doing overpriced bus tours and you can go to and from both areas (Uluru and Kata Tjuta), as you please."

Reddit/aww,Alice Springs Desert Park,The man who runs this is called Brolga and I got to meet him and tour the sanctuary a few years back. That man is really something special. At the time I was there it was literally just him in a tiny shack of a house on several acres of land. He hand nurses joeys and then introduces them back into the wild or into his flock. They stay with him 24/7 until they're ready. He's expanded since then and even taken in a couple of camels. You can follow The Kangaroo Sanctuary Alice Springs on FB for lots of cute pics and vids.

Interesting place Alice Springs."
Reddit/aww,Alice Springs Desert Park,> The Kangaroo Sanctuary Alice Springs I read the entire Facebook page in an aussie accent.
Reddit/aww,Alice Springs Desert Park,"No problem. Yes and no. Roo's that are born in the sanctuary aren't let back in the wild because the Australian government considers them domesticated which means they stand a pretty poor chance of surviving out in the wild due to their social behavior around other roo's, instincts (or lack there of) towards predators and attitudes towards humans (wild roo's would run at the sight of you, domesticated ones *will* attack you if they are male). That being so, most of the roo's in the sanctuary were born there, are injured/unsuitable for reintroduction to the wild, in the possession of someone else and given up or in some cases found by aboriginals who hunt kangaroo's and instead of killing the joey (or taking them as pets) give them to Barolga's safe care. However, certain joey's they rescue are released back into the wild as soon as they reach their ""teens"". This is because they aren't considered pets but being rehabilitated for being reintroduced out into the wild. Barolga will try to find a suitable location that is frequented by roo's (which is much easier than you'd think, roo's are everywhere around and sometimes in Alice Springs) and release them."

Reddit/AskScienceFiction,Alice Springs Desert Park,"With the much stronger sunlight of Alice Springs, Farken'AwesumBloke is much stronger than that pissweak Superman of Earth-0, his cells having developed to absorb and be a more efficient capacitor of solar energy. With his battle cry of ""Faaarrrk'n'El"", Farken'AwesumBloke is his world's foremost protector, fighting for Mateship, a Fair Go, and the preservation of his Centrelink Payments. Admired and respected by his fellow heroes, he is known for his affable nature, honesty, being a 'top bloke', glorious mullet, racist comments targeted at anyone who isn't an Anglo Australian, and addressing his allies as ""Oi, Cunt!"". Despite often being the first into the fray (particularly if he's been downing tinnies all arvo) he has sometimes failed to answer the call to arms, claiming he's ""..feeling a bit crook, I must've had a bad snag at the barbie yesterday.."", the use of this excuse after public holidays, long weekends or major sporting events leads many of his compatriots to conclude that he is indeed pulling a Super Sickie. Farken'AwesumBloke has actually met Kal-El during the Crisis of Metric Shit-tons of Earths, and found him to be totally up-himself and unable to take a joke. The Crisis was a sad time for Farken'AwesumBloke, as his steadfast ally and good mate, the mighty KiwiBro, hurt his back during battle, and has (claimed) to be unable to work full time since, staying home and collecting a disabilty allowance instead. Maintaining a secret identity in Alice Springs, Farken'AwesumBloke is known to his friends, neighbors and the Alice Springs Police as Gary Graham, a not-mild-mannered-at-all part time diesel mechanic and forklift driver. A well liked fixture at the local TAB, backyard barbies or Lasseters Hotel Casino on Barrett Drive. Gary, or 'Gazza' as he prefers to be known is considered by those who know him to be a good laugh, a good sort (and a 'top root' by his ex-missus). However, when duty calls, Gaza hops out of his Holden Ute, takes off his Oakley sunnies and springs into action as Farken'AwesumBloke, Earth's foremost defender! Edit: Bloody'ell! Gold!! My first!!

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Well it's simple economics, because no one wants to live here there is a huge shortage of skilled and non skilled workers, so if you are prepared to put up with living in a place that is essentially like a town in a 3rd world country then you will reap the many benefits like living rent free, vehicles provided and making a huge amount of money. Ironically this town is a gold mine, people would be surprised to know how many self made millionaires Alice has produced and still does, these people could live anywhere in Australia but this is where the coin is. I've heard of numerous young couples who have moved up here to grind it out and within a few years they own their home out right. This is the strange juxtaposition of Alice Springs. Lawlessness and town camps that are no different to the slums you see in 3rd world countries, while five minutes across town and you find yourself on the golf course estate which is almost exclusively where the wealthy have built their mansions, which is where they keep their Ferrari's and Lamborghinis. And you know what, they deserve every penny they've made. That's what can happen with a basic education, an apprenticeship and heaps of hard work and dedication, where as sitting on your fat ass and expecting everything to be provided for you on a silver platter by the government breeds nothing but lazy slobs who don't even think looking after their own children is their responsibility."

Lots of people have been watching a Youtuber called Spaniard who does an episode on Alice Springs. But ... by Detroit standards, and US standards in general, you will not find any suburb or town in Australia that equates. My son has just come back from living in Philly and LA and he said the worst suburbs he saw in the US were loose as. Mind you he played soccer for South Philly and saw a few of it's rougher suburbs. Alice Springs and our outback towns are probably wild in their own special way. There is a kinda an unwritten rule driving in the outback in NT that if there's an aboriginal lying on the road in the middle of nowhere you do not stop because it's a likely ambush by others.

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"For the people that don't know, this is a time where Aboriginals from communities far away come to Alice Springs. Often come without any money, expecting to stay with family. They do what they do usually in communities for millennia which is to fight among each other. Stabbing each other in arms or legs. Aboriginal communities are not nor have ever been peaceful. This is not surprising since they had to survive in an extremely harsh environment . The article below is from 2008 and nothing has changed. News Alice Springs is `world stabbing capital' STABBINGS in Central Australia's tourist capital Alice Springs have reached epidemic proportions, and traditional Aboriginal thigh spearing is being blamed. STABBINGS in Central Australia's tourist capital Alice Springs have reached epidemic proportions, and traditional Aboriginal thigh spearing is being blamed. Surgeons at Alice Springs Hospital say the town is in crisis, with the number of stab injuries, blunt force injuries, bone breaks and burns admissions rising. The town now reports the highest rate of stabbings in the world, with 390 incidents for every 100,000 people. Most concerning, say the medics, is that almost 40 per cent of the stabbings were thigh injuries most likely meted out by Aboriginal elders as traditional punishment. The practice, designed to settle grievances, is performed by elders who ""have a deep knowledge of human anatomy and are skilled at spearing the femoral artery with deft accuracy,"" Dr Abraham Jacob wrote in a report published in the latest ANZ Journal of Surgery. The study shows 16 of the 605 Aborigines admitted with thigh stab wounds between 1998 and 2005 were dead on arrival. ""We found a significant and particular pattern of traditional stab injuries,"" Dr Jacob said. ""Medial thigh injury to kill, posterior thigh to permanently disable and lateral thigh to punish."" Contrary to anecdotal reports, women were just as likely to be subjected to the practice as men, and the location was town camps and homes, not streets or pubs as previously thought. Alcohol played a role in 30 per cent of stabbing admissions. About 20 per cent of the victims were admitted with stab wounds more than once, and in the same number of cases the victim absconded before they had completed treatment. Dr Jacob and his colleagues said the study was the first to reveal the extent of injury and death due to traditional spearing, saying it adds to the town's growing poor statistics. ""Alice Springs has been given the title of the crime capital of Australia, and its town camps have been described as a 'sea of despair' with conditions similar to South African ghetto townships,"" Dr Jacob said. The camps' population was expected to double in the next five years, speeding up already increasing rates of injury and death. ""Central Australia's tourist capital is in crisis,"" he said. ""A multi-pronged approach is needed, engaging Aboriginal leaders, social uplifting and economical support and education of the entire community"

That's all too much pressure for them! Don't you know they've had it tough!? Now, every single other group doing it tough, it's fine for them. Obviously. It's how WE get ahead, but not these fragile, weak, sorry lot that need our elite wonderful enlightened guidance - ah the white man's burden sure is heavy! If only there were some way to put it down.

You frog march the parents to the school each day their kid isn't there until they know the score, like they do with every other group. I think there are some incredibly sheltered adults put into positions of power, like magistrates and psychologists, who can't help but compare their own upbringing to these kids - but it's apples and oranges. We know what helps disadvantaged groups, but we have decided this disadvantaged group is too fragile for it, while every other disadvantaged group is obviously tough enough for it. It's the same thing that got many of those privileged groups to their position where they could afford to shelter their kids - study."

The colour of my skin or my genetic heritage should never even come into it, it would make no difference or hold any value. Indigenous Australians are already favoured by the system and given opportunities that other people aren‚Äôt. It was noted during the process that indigenous people, approximately 500,000 people, have roughly $30 billion per year allocated to them but that funding very rarely makes it through to them. Now that‚Äôs an issue that needs fixing before we put some sort of advisory committee together. So, I‚Äôm not ignorant, And when it comes to Race I speak as I find. When you look at what‚Äôs going on in Alice Springs and who the perpetrators are it isn‚Äôt little old white ladies is it?"
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"No, they are Australian citizens in Australia, entitled to the same rights as any other Australian. If we are going to scrap law and order to protect the public from others, then we need to scrap all law and order and allow the entire country to be lawless rather than selecting just one area. Not to mention that this isn't purely an Aboriginal issue, there are plenty of people in Alice Springs, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, and no one should be left behind."

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Can I just say, if any of the many inner city left people on this subreddit spent even one night in Alice Springs/Katherine, any other rural town, they'd be screaming about where is the govt intervention for all this crime. These places aren't like Perth or Melbourne or Sydney, 12-15 year olds are running wild damaging property, stealing vehicles, and law enforcement are hamstrung to stop them due to any action taken being seen as 'racism'. Edit: and here come the inner city left people with no real experience or understanding of rural towns, out of their bubble to downvote realism."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"From someone who lives in alice springs First off the new idiot mayor was asking for the army because he has no idea how local government works. Just attend a town meeting. Second the so called extra police for alice springs this year, they spent most of the time in operations in remote communities and very little in town. They also left before the busy season of Christmas when from the 20th dec to mid of January when they go on a house break in rampage every year. Last year it was almost every day of Jan till mid Feb some youth try to break into my place. But I can say last year response by police was time decent, unlike this year's non existence. If you had driven past the police at night in last 6 months you would have seen that they only had two car out on patrol. So response time is 1 1/2 hours unless emergency then at least 1/2 hour most of the time. The council does currently pay ""talice security"" to patrol the town at night and watch the cameras, but if seen any of their security officer they are on their phone all night and just stand their and not call in the stolen cars doing burnouts in from of them. if you ask about it they grunt a yes then go back to watching tiktoc. As to alcohol restrictions, they won't have much effect unless they close the sly goggers in the town camps and it mostly youth stealing alcohol not adults. The youth problem has been getting worst every year since they reduced the funding to a third and redirected the remaining services to limit scope of works. ( they did increase it by 30% after 12 months of major youth issues) Yes this is also same time they removed the banned drinkers register and we had people partying in the streets for months till they doubled the police in town for a few months. Youth issue is partly due to culture difference and centerlink payments. Traditionally the aunty and grandmother look after the kids but if the parents want the extra money, they keep the kids on paper. Then dump them on the grandmothers and when their no longer a child under tradition at 13, they do what ever they desire. Where are the parents about half are off living their life on the extra centerlink money. As for youth corrections that the only place they get a education for most of these youth out on the streets at night. Because the parents see it as school / goverment to educate them not parent's responsibility to send them to school. Anyway, for me, I have had enough and I am leaving town."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs is a war zone and that is not a joke. Rocks getting lobbed at cars, trolleys going through windows, cars getting stolen and smashed into buildings."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,I would bet you 1000 buckaroos I would feel safer sleeping in Alice springs as opposed to Brisbane. Just the media in Australia trying to sensationalise something that isn't there.
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"At this rate, why not declare Alice Springs dry for everyone?"
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Grew up in Alice Springs. What would the army be able to do in the long term, the prisons are full and the facilities are short staffed."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You need to fact check your post mate. The banned drinkers registry is alive and well‚Ä¶ and judging by your spelling and grammar I suspect calling the mayor an idiot is possibly a case of the pot calling the kettle black. While you‚Äôve made a great point about Centrelink and culture, it‚Äôs not quite the full picture. Many of these problematic people are not local Arrernte people, they come from other communities and only remain in Alice Springs to access grog or because they are unwelcome in their own communities. The issue with the cops here is they are over worked. They arrive on the job each day with 50+ jobs to catch up on and when they do actually arrest someone, they pay for it dearly in paperwork."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I don‚Äôt live in Alice Springs, but only heard that the mayor requested the AFP not the ADF. This is justified as the federal government is actually responsible for law enforcement in the territories."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,Not as scary as it is for the decent folks trying to live in Alice Springs I'd wager.
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,It‚Äôs already a scary time for indigenous people in Alice Springs due to the amount of violence and crime. Denying that this exists is racist in itself. This has been asked to happen by the community.
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"News Corp is a disgrace but in the case of Alice Springs the violence and crime is almost exclusively committed by aboriginal teenagers. There are a lot of complicated factors including Intergenerational poverty and plain old demographics but it is a fact nonetheless, no point pretending otherwise"

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Because it was dry for 15 years and look at what's happened. Very clearly having a dry town isn't a long term solution. If turning it into a dry town helps it should only be considered in the short term AND 1) Evidence based addiction programs (and I'm not talking AA/NA) be put in place 2) monitoring of other substance abuse is undertaken - guaranteed if you ban alcohol other addiction rates go up 3) some kind if responsible drinking program be implemented. I wouldn't be surprised if some of this is due to the 18-33 demographic not being socialised to alcohol at all. Lastly, we need to know if the crime epidemic is actually fuelled by alcohol or if it's a correlation or coincidence. Rates of crime have risen since the end of last year... so has economic stress (everything is more expensive). Also DV rates have risen everywhere due to covid - is it possible that the Alice springs is experiencing a delayed response because its more isolated?"
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,I agree. Was in the military now living in Alice Springs (working in a non defence job). The Army/Defence Force has no role here except maybe engineers improving remote communities. Unless training has changed they would be useless in the role unless you are establishing road blokes - which don‚Äôt really stop gangs of young kids running through the laneways and bushes.
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You can't compare Chicago to Alice Springs. Different culture, different people, different government, different laws, different cops, nothing is the same."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,then they will all just move to the next town over that sells grog and continue to cause problems. People moved to Alice springs because grog was banned in communities
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Spot on, the alcohol problem is just a symptom. These kids are a product of the environment they grow up in and a sense of hopelessness about their future, sad truth is that the other symptom is suicide rate. I do not have a clue as to the solution, better minds have been working at tgis for a long time. Not really sure about the value of Albo visiting other than as response to the opposition as pretty sure he is well briefed on the issue. The people advocating harsh punishment which changes nothing when prison is a right of passage should reflect on that it is only an accident of their own privilaged birth that separates them from the kids in Alice Springs."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,Get me statistics showing Alice Springs is more dangerous than Brisbane. Then we will talk reality.......
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,Other than Alice Springs being the home of all ADF staff based at Pine Gap. The town also has a large number of American staff too. I expect Albo has been informed of this through ‚Äúchannels‚Äù
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I do not mean to imply that indigenous youth are necessarily more prone to crime than non-indigenous youth, hence my comment about demographics. It just so happens that the demographics of central Australia and Alice Springs mean that the poorest communities tend to be aborginal. In other parts of Australia that would not be the case. Its also true that the absolute numbers of youths committing these offence is relatively low, a few dozen at most, probably much less. The crime rates are so high because the reoffending rates are so high. For all the progress of recent decades Alice is still quite a segregated town, with some nice suburbs for the non-indigenous and a lot of poor aboriginal people. In addition, Alice is the only town of any size in central Australia and there is a very transient population of people drifting in and out from the surrounding communities for services. They tend to stay in various town camps around the town and there is a lot of violence and grog in them. In addition those central Australia remote communities are poor in a way i think most australians cannot comprehend. I used to occasionally visit some of them and i have never seen anything like it. I grew up in the working class north of England and lived for many years in London and i though i knew what poverty looked like but a trip to Yuendumu made me realise i knew nothing of what real poverty is. These places are poor like african villages are poor, burnt out cars and poorly constructed buildings. They are so remote i would certainly also develop a drinking or drug problem if i had to live there, there is almost literally nothing to do except get drunk or high. I felt like i had fell off the map. You are correct that the common thread here is poverty. The reasons for that poverty are intergenerational, multi faceted and very very complicated, but it does not change the fact that the anti social behaviour and crime in Alice Springs is predominantly, almost exclusively committed by aboriginal people. This needs to be acknowledged in the first instance before anything can be done. If you were in Geelong or Canberra or Newcastle or a hundred other towns in Australia it would not be the case, but in Alice Springs it is"

When I had a car I stayed at Double Tree Hilton or The Crowne Plaza and when I didn't have a car I stayed at Elkira Court Motel. If I went out at night, I caught a taxi back although I did walk between Double Tree and The Crowne at night sometimes. In the day it sometimes gets crowded and rowdy in the area between the Woolies shopping centre and the Coles shopping centre. Hopefully the markets and some other events are on while you're there. I really loved Alice."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were there a few weeks ago. My feelings: during the day you are fine to walk the streets, especially of the ‚ÄòCBD‚Äô. It‚Äôs quiet and there‚Äôs generally regular people walking around running errands etc. Locals told me that after dark is unsafe, usually 11pm onwards because Aboriginal folks get drunk and get into fights, break into cars and kids wander the street. We noticed during the week it was mostly ok at night, but I‚Äôve heard the weekend can get rowdy. I found Alice Springs has a lovely energy, grounded, vibrant and very alive. It is not the demonic hellhole many people will try to paint it as. It is a town with a lot of social issuers, sure, but it isn‚Äôt unlike many other towns. A lot of the Aboriginal folks are there to live their lives the best way they know how in a ‚Äòwhite town‚Äô. Enjoy your time there!"

I moved here on an 18 month contract in 2017 with every intention of moving back once that time was up. But somehow Alice Springs became the place I consider home.

OK, no worries, I guess. Perfectly normal night with a few beers and a feed before stepping out for a post meal smoke. Boom - about 15 kids out of nowhere on scooters and bikes. Eyed us off for a moment before yelling ""nah, them some big mf's, hey"" and bolting. Didn't think much of it until we visited the local IGA the next day - ""Oh yeah, they were fully planning to rob and beat you. It's just fortunate you're not small guys"".

But the long intervention years of federal cutbacks to communities, the mainstreaming of programming, punitive cashless welfare and years of opaque funding processes forcing them to go cap-in-hand to the minister for a bite of the Coalition‚Äôs $4.9bn Indigenous advancement strategy while millions were handed to big business, have also been to blame. Aboriginal organisations say they warned the Morrison government that if the intervention-era bans on alcohol in remote communities were to lapse, harms would rise dramatically. They weren‚Äôt heard, but they were right. In mid-July, liquor became legal in some communities for the first time in 15 years. NT police statistics show property offences have jumped by almost 60% over the past 12 months, assaults have increased by 38% and domestic violence assaults by 48%. ‚ÄúThis was something that was predicted,‚Äù Dr John Boffa told Guardian Australia.

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The grog ban (NT Intervention) was focused on remote communities in the NT, and towncamps in Alice. The problem is that these mob can't drink in the communities so they travel to Alice Springs to do so. Some of these mobs have issues with other mobs, and these issues flare up when they are all camping in Alice and the alcohol is flowing freely. The majority of them live in poverty. Consumerism, Capitalism, addiction and a dire need for money has been forced upon them after they were self-sufficient and sober for thousands of years. Theft and crime happens for this reason. I was born and grew up in Alice. I saw the impacts of the Intervention, and right now we are seeing the the after effects of the intervention. Also, wet season is happening, so many remote community campers are stuck in Alice because of floods. I call for Australia to ban alcohol.

Reddit/ABCaus,Alice Springs Desert Park,Comparing youth crime in Alice Springs to the American Civil war ? Need your head checked mare.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It depends on your definition of ""safe."" Property crime is definitely a major concern, but cross-racial violence is pretty low, and murder/maiming is extremely rare. Most of the violence is domestic, and not against strangers/tourists. The biggest concern for tourists is having your vehicle broken into, windows smashed, etc. The cause of this crime is pretty basic. This a remote town, without any major industry. Tourism is dying thanks to Uluru having its own airport, a bad reputation dissuading inter-state travelers, and a growing lack of interest in local activities. Whenever you have poverty, lack of opportunities, and subpar social programs, crime will always be high. There are also fundamental differences in indigenous culture and ""Westernized"" culture, which contributes to the social unrest. The primary reason Alice Springs makes the news is because of its unique social/racial dynamics which often become the basis for political rhetoric. Liberals blame Labor for being too soft on indigenous offenders, Labor blames the Liberals for lack of support for social programs etc. It is also an internationally recognized location, so it is a convenient topic if you want to garner some quick attention. I have lived here for four years without major issues and rarely feel unsafe, but I also come from a city with prevalent gun violence and a much higher murder rate. My perspective is most definitely skewed compared to those from safer countries."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Rather sadly, Alice Springs has a number of youths and disaffected people not in education or training, who then turn to petty crime, like car theft, break-and-enter, assault, trading or using drugs and or illicit alcohol. Too many young people there don't have safe or stable home lives, so being out and about on the streets sometimes a better option."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Central Australia has a number of tiny little settlements of Indigenous communities. These communities have undergone a fair amount of generational trauma with the breakdown of traditional tribal structures as previously migratory groups settled in a single place and successive governments have alternately tried to destroy, assimilate, coddle and punish these groups over the last hundred years. They remain aware of but separate from the standard Trainspotting monologue that guides mainstream society. Most of these communities also have mobile phone coverage so people can see exactly what they don‚Äôt have but, being a small population in a small country, there is next to no online representation of their situation. The worst damage has been the introduction of alcohol and recreational drugs which people have wholeheartedly latched onto as an escape from monotony and misery. With birth rates rising and infant mortality falling, there‚Äôs been an expansion of the younger demographics but, because many of the older community members are wasting away on alcohol, these youths lack leadership and role models so they form gangs to, essentially, entertain each other. Bad ideas enter these groups, rattle around and escalate in the way that teens try to outdo each other. For occasional big events - such as the local Show (county fair) or a visiting national football game - these groups come to Alice Springs which at 20,000 people is the biggest city within a thousand kilometres. The groups often have beef - real, imagined or even based on tribal history- and use these opportunities to settle scores. All the good things in Alice Springs costs money which these groups do not have, so they steal, often with an accompanying threat of violence because, well, that‚Äôs what works. The one thing that is free is adrenaline so there‚Äôs also a lot of risk-taking like stealing cars and being chased by the police, which often ends in a fatal crash. On the up-side, they don‚Äôt use guns but knives are becoming more prominent. Things like hammers are regular weapons but spears come out when shit really gets real and they are planning on someone dying. If you‚Äôve ever been near a guy with a spear who‚Äôs pissed off at you, it is not a good experience. Edited to add paragraphs because of complaints"

In this context, a lot of Indigenous youth, especially in places like Alice Springs, have been impacted by suicide of family members or friends. Imagine the impact that has on a developing mind. The Uluru Statement from the Heart goes into great detail about the pervasive issues impacting First Nations communities and made strong recommendations supported by hundreds of Indigenous Elders from across Australia. This included recommending a voice to Parliament and followed by a Treaty to put the development of solutions in the hands of Indigenous communities. It is a crying shame that the Voice referendum was voted down. First Nations people and advocates will be feeling the impact of this for a long time."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"That's not what I said at all. I am talking about Alice Springs and the people that are causing the problems specifically. As I said, to marginalise someone means to make them less able to do things or access basic services or opportunities. I would say that the people in and around Alice have been the opposite of marginalised. They have been given far more in assistance, be it cash, land, and housing than others. The majority have done well with that and used it to create communities, form businesses and provide for their children. We are not talking about the productive members of society though, we are talking about the trouble makers terrorising everyone else. I'm not making this a race thing either. Not all of the trouble makers are aboriginal and not all of the productive memebers of society are white."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Do you think that every Aboriginal person has this connection to the trauma? It's not even numerically possible.

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Ok. Here it is- The Australian Labor party are the primary issue here. The NT has been run by the Labor party for 20 of the last 24 years. As a near 30 year resident I can hand on heart say that Labor has destroyed the NT through pandering to minority groups, corruption, deceit and utter incompetence. The courts have just as much blame to wear as the Labor party with lenient sentencing and terrible precedent setting and now criminals think they are innocent of any crime because they think their tough upbringing explains anything they do. We are now seeing a generation of Uneducated (‚Äòbecause western education isn‚Äôt right for these poor people‚Äô), Angry (because their parents blame the white man for their woes/poverty/self abuse and they‚Äôve pushed that onto the next generation), Hopeless and Self Loathing children coming through. Alice Springs will wear the brunt of this because there are so many remote communities surrounding the town and when these people who‚Äôre Lost in life, Angry at the establishment and Fear no law come to town they just dont care what damage they do.

Here's a neat idea, since you blame it on that then why don't you do something fix it starting with you Now before you go accuse me of being a white colonizer, I'm Vietnamese and I immigrated here legally"
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Nope. This is a pathetic cop out. My ancestors were mostly Irish. I also have African ancestors who were enslaved, but that‚Äôs a whole separate topic. The Irish were the first to be colonised by Britain, and they were subjugated by the British Monarchy and the British Empire for over 800 years. I have ancestors who were murdered, raped, wrongly imprisoned, tortured, enslaved and exiled, simply for being Irish. Their land, culture and language were stolen from them, to the point where Gaelic is now considered a ‚Äúdead language‚Äù. Britain has never even acknowledged the utter hell they subjected the Irish to, let alone apologised or issued any sort of reparations, despite their tyrannical reign only officially ending in 1998 (except Northern Ireland remains largely in shambles from ‚ÄúThe Troubles‚Äù and is *still* under British occupation). My family, among millions of others, had endured over 700 years worth of ‚Äúintergenerational trauma‚Äù and colonisation before the Aboriginals encountered a single European. My family is still significantly affected by what happened to our ancestors in Ireland. Britain‚Äôs reign of terror altered Irish people‚Äôs DNA, genetically predisposing the native Irish population and the diaspora to psychiatric illnesses (especially neurotic and anxiety disorders), addiction (primarily alcoholism, which is rampant in Ireland), gastrointestinal issues (due to generations of severe malnutrition), increased cancer risk, and plenty of other horrific diseases. My great-grandparents were raised by survivors of ‚ÄúThe Great Famine‚Äù, a genocide which the British Empire instigated by poisoning Irish crops and perpetuated by stealing the crops the Irish *did* manage to grow and sending them straight to England. The Famine Queen (Queen Victoria) and other British aristocrats would stuff their fat faces with Irish-grown crops, while the Irish people starved to death. It‚Äôs worth noting the British people outside of the ruling class didn‚Äôt benefit from this, they were also oppressed and subjugated by Her Royal Lard-ness and her family pole (not tree) of ingrates. My great-grandparents recalled stories they‚Äôd heard from their parents and grandparents about watching people die in agony from starvation in the streets. The bodies of people they knew and loved were piled up everywhere. Entire villages were wiped out, to make room for British settlers. My great-grandparents grew up around people who had suffered from nervous breakdowns, because they‚Äôd been surrounded by so much death and suffering, and people who had lifelong physical health problems as a result of chronic starvation and malnutrition. Hoarding, paranoia, anxiety, anger, depression, neurosis, post-traumatic stress, emotional repression and alcoholism were just a few of the common reactions and traits among the famine survivors, and sadly these were often passed down. The bodies of several of my ancestors, who were tortured and murdered by the British, were taken to England as ‚Äútrophies‚Äù and they still haven‚Äôt been returned to Ireland. Ireland has never fully recovered and we‚Äôre all just expected to act like none of this ever happened. Ignorant people constantly undermine our history and label us as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù, despite the fact that the British coined that term and made it abundantly clear that only British people were considered ‚Äúwhite‚Äù. But guess what? None of what I‚Äôve just listed gives *me* an excuse to be a violent thug. Why on earth would it? My ancestors fought and survived against the odds, so that their descendants (including me) could have a better life. I‚Äôm not going to spit in their faces by being a degenerate, especially when, comparatively, I live in the kind of luxury they never could‚Äôve dreamed of. I will never have to worry about having enough food to eat, or whether myself or my family will survive the winter. I won‚Äôt have to watch my children die from starvation in a genocide. I‚Äôm considered a human being under the law and afforded the same rights as my British peers. I have the freedom to speak whatever languages I want. I have the freedom to practice my religion and embrace my cultural heritage. I don‚Äôt live in constant fear of being exiled, enslaved, raped, tortured, imprisoned or murdered on the whims of British government or monarchy. King Chucky and his family of nonces have no power over me. They can‚Äôt hurt me in the way their predecessors hurt not just my ancestors, but hundreds of millions of other people‚Äôs ancestors too. *Billions* of people can play the ‚Äúoppression card‚Äù, for so many reasons. Hell, what the British inflicted upon the Aboriginals in Australia is a footnote in history, compared to the tyranny they inflicted elsewhere. There‚Äôs no fucking excuse for what‚Äôs happening in Alice Springs. It‚Äôs time for people to step up and take accountability for their own actions. They need to actively make the choice to break the cycles of abuse and criminality and stop making pathetic excuses for thei"

Reddit/OldPhotosInRealLife,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I love finding glass negatives in pairs, when you just know they were loaded back to back in their wooden cartridge for use on the same day. It makes the moment more interesting. I posted the other picture last week. The photographer is the kids‚Äô father Thomas A Bradshaw. His diary notes tell us this was the day his 5th child was born, just over a km away down the Todd River, at the Telegraph station. His kids had a great time here, riding horses and going on adventures. Thomas was a quiet bloke who preferred a book to a picnic but if he did go out he brought his camera, a wooden Thornton Pickard camera. He applied to go back to Adelaide after a few years but they made him stay for 8. He got a holiday after 5 years though. He made several hundred photos of the early years here, a wonderful historic record. His youngest daughter was born when they returned and had to listen to her siblings recount their adventures. She was so jealous she smashed stacks of his negatives before her siblings rescued the remainder. They were donated to the Alice Springs Telegraph Station museum, and later archived.

Now, there almost certainly is a crime issue in Alice Springs, and almost certainly more most be done at all levels... But running up and demanding the whole place be put under martial law, and randomly critisising anyone who doesn't agree with you isn't exactly screaming ""I AM HERE TO START THE HEALING PROCESS"", either. Edit/update: Sussan Ley has provided data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (ah, now it is okay to ""trust the bureaucrats"" on this issue, after Dutton critisised a reporter for asking for evidence) showing that child sexual abuse is indeed much higher in Alice Springs than the national average. Here is the thing - the numbers she is quoting from ARE FROM 2021. At this point, the Alcohol restrictions were still in place, general crime stats had been rising since 2020, and more critically, PETER DUTTON AND SUSSAN LEY WERE LITERALLY RUNNING THE COUNTRY AT THE TIME.

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Alice Springs Desert Park,">Police commissioner is incompetent Ever heard of Ockham's Razor? It's a logical theorem that suggests that when you're confronted with two (or more) conflicting reports, the one that requires the *least* stretch of the imagination is the one that is most likely to be true. So here we've got a case of it either being: 1. Dutton is inventing anecdotal evidence to make a political point. 2. There is a conspiracy to cover up police inaction, which would require multiple senior politicians and police members to be some combination of grossly incompetent, incredibly negligent or outright malicious in their actions. Taken on balance, the first is far more likely than the second because despite supposedly having knowledge of this sexual abuse, Dutton hasn't actually reported it. And while he might not be a mandatory reporter, the fact that he chose to make vague references in a press conference rather than provide specific details to police speaks volumes -- even before you consider that Dutton is a former police officer and would be familiar with this process. Secondly, there hasn't been a single conscientious objector to come forward and either verify Dutton's claims about the extent of sexual abuse or some kind of conspiracy in the rank-and-file of police. This reeks of Dutton trying to ride the coat-tails of that woman who reported widespread sexual abuse in Alice Springs a few weeks ago. She was presented to the public as a nurse; the strong implication was that she was a registered nurse, but it soon emerged that she was not and that she was far less involved in the process than first suggested. This is exactly what QAnon did with the ""Save the Childen"" movement. They realised very early on that protecting children is an issue that the overwhelming majority of people would support, so they used it as a Trojan horse for their own conspiratorial views."

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"https://pfes.nt.gov.au/police/community-safety/nt-crime-statistics/alice-springs Crime rates are absolutely worse under the current Labor Government, However the crime rates in Alice Springs have absolutely nothing to do with the current Federal Government. They‚Äôre the end result of decades of selling off housing commission, the closure of half way and emergency housing by both CLP and NT ALP governments since 2010, and the end of support of major community outreach programs like Blue Light Discos. Less houses for people to live in, removal of the places you could go to avoid a bad home environment for the night, and removal of activities that provided a positive connection between disadvantaged youths and the police as a means of support. The place has been downhill since Paul Henderson. I‚Äôve been saying it since 2016 NT ALP and CLP have the exact same philosophy on how to deal with problem youths, but they only disagree on one bit, the size of the stick to use. The house next door to me in Katherine used to be a half way house for youth, 9 beds, tutors, counsellors, consoles, access to books, sports in backyard, bus to drop off at school Funding got cut and it was sold, in a 5 year period 7 houses like that were sold. The house my parents bought in 2001 was ex housing commission, part of 40 sold in a three year period, mid 2010s an apartment complex of 35 2-3 bedroom housing commission townhouses were sold to a private developer after 8 of them suffered fire damage. Two 10 unit housing commission complexes also sold between 2000-2020. That‚Äôs just the ones I noticed, how many new housing commission buildings in that time frame? Two vacant blocks currently set aside for eventual development and a 6 unit 1 bedroom complex set aside exclusively for disabled residents. And that‚Äôs just Katherine, and it gets extra resources because of the RAAF base."

It is pretty safe. The aboriginals can be very aggressive to white people but if you ignore them they leave you alone. They dont do anything to us but are often seeing fighting with each other. They also smell really bad so have to hold your breath when they are nearby. The Casino is the place where most people go for dinner, drinks, anything at night. There wasnt much crime when i was there because there was no druggies."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs is like living in total hell. The local population, especially the high Indigenous representation, are like satanic monsters. They are extremely vile and aggressive, and always take the opportunity to bash an innocent person to death, or damage a lot of property. A long history of racial tension, drug and alcohol abuse is responsible for that, and that‚Äôs why alcohol is banned and even curfews are in place. Even the local hospital has to be heavily guarded by tall fences! It is one of the most violent places in Australia and even in the entire world. It‚Äôs in fact the 18th highest crime rate in the world. You‚Äôre better off coming to one of our major cities instead."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,As a kiwi I can tell you Alice Springs is a truly wild place. Be a horrible place to live
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Look there are a lot of people here and I‚Äôm not sure how many have ever visited Alice, let alone lived there. Yes you will hear a lot of terrible stats and news about Alice - always remember ‚Äúif it bleeds, it leads‚Äù, and the media love stories about ‚Äúgangs of black fellas causing strife‚Äù. Alice Springs does have a lot of challenges but generally is safe. I have visited many many times and have many friends who have and continue to live there. There are high rates of petty crimes like break, enter, steal. There are a lot of assaults but often these will be domestic in nature or persons known to each other. The accommodation options are all pretty secure. Basic rules of securing your property and belongings and don‚Äôt leave things unlocked or outside. If you are relocating with an employer they are definitely best placed to advice on recommendations on where to live and who to contact if they aren‚Äôt organising accommodation for you. Alice has some of the most beautiful environment around it with lots of things to do, particularly if you are into arts and nature. This thread has heaps of positives that may also temper some of the scary things people are saying. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/s/EX1fF8IEuq Every locations has pros and cons, sometimes some areas have more of one than another but every persons experience and view of a place is individual to them and may not accurately reflect the true nature of the place."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Some friends of mine lived and worked in Alice Springs about 10 years ago. The story they told that stuck with me was people being eaten by dogs.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I have stayed one night in Alice Springs in my life, in a pretty secure caravan park that made me feel a sense of safety‚Ä¶ My car got broken into overnight and I lost a lot of my stuff. *edit spelling"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I worked with the NT Police for a month in 2020 and all the stuff they talked about was just how crazy Alice Springs really was. And the biggest problems were DV and youths running rampant. I spoke with a probationary cop who'd been in the force only four months and in that time she'd already spiked three cars driven by youths. They all supported the use of spit hoods because spitting is all but guaranteed. One thing that really surprised me is that they noticed that once the youths turned 17-18 they all but ceased becoming brats because they knew they'd be held accountable for their actions. One good thing the cops said was that because of all the crime, the pay was really good and there was no shortage of overtime with most cops pulling in over $150K a year in Alice with all the OT and allowances."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,I've only ever been once. Was travelling around Australia with mates and stopped in at Alice Springs. There was a burnt out van directly out the front of the hostel/backpackers. We walked to a bottle shop at about 8-9pm through a open mall type thing and there were a group of kids there who immediately hurled abuse. First time i've been called a white cunt. Luckily we're all fairly large guys and don't look like a easy target. Also got hassled out for food at the KFC when leaving the next day. Can't say it felt particularly safe.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As a local the narrative at the moment greatly saddens me. Our systems have failed people and there are angry hurting kids who are crying out for help by doing stupid shit and committing crimes and then, once they are caught they are still not given the help they need. Please do not misinterpret what I am saying as me denying there is a problem. There 100% is. But the people of this town are not pulling together to try and solve it. And this problem can not be solved by one organisation and it can not be solved overnight. It will have to be a joint effort and it will take a life time. It is so much more complex then just youth crime. Alice Springs at it's core is truly beautiful. The landscape is stunning. The people are friendly, the culture is rich and there is such a strong spirit among those of us who call it home. You can always count on the community coming together to support you if you find yourself in a rough patch. I also want to say that there are SO MANY wonderful local aboriginal people who are also worried and mourning and feel a great sense of shame. Do not let what you see paint your opinion of them as a whole group. There is a minority who are ruining it for everyone else. There are those online who will talk about how many of us are leaving this town.... there are also a huge group of us who refuse to leave as we care deeply and want stay and work to help this lovely place. I don't think I can fully explain the love I have for Alice but when I first stepped foot in the NT as a kid I knew I would live in the NT once I grew up and when I moved to Alice 7 years ago I immediately knew I had found my home. This place is special, but it is hurting."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's definitely up there in terms of the most socieconomically challenged places in Aus, and with that comes a higher rate of individuals in desperate situations.

There‚Äôs something about Alice Springs and I‚Äôd love to go back sometime. Sad to hear that the town‚Äôs social problems have accelerated but it‚Äôs coming from Peta Credlin, Dutton and Sky news. These disgusting people are using the town‚Äôs well known issues to score political points. If you are going to focus on such a problem you need to be prepared to help."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's a really complex situation. There's a whole community that have intergenerational trauma, no resources and a lack of care from the government. There's a documentary called ""in my blood it runs"" and I would recommend watching it. It's about one of the kids who lives on the outskirts of Alice Springs and his family send him back to his father's country to be raised by the Elders on country. It's probably not possible but we need to connect people back with their country. These kids need a connection. A lot of them have grown up in broken homes witnessing violence and drug and alcohol abuse. Many of their parents are in and out of jail. We have the largest indigenous population behind bars. Obviously jail isn't working. Healing is the only way forward and we need strong Elders to pave the way for the future generations. The government needs to walk side-by-side with the community leaders and the Elders to come up with a solution."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Unrelated to the original comment (though getting stabbed twice in 6 months with only weekly trips is absolutely bonkers) but, as a lifelong city-slicker who has never lived in suburbia let alone a small town, what was living in Yulara like? It's a 4 and a half hour drive to Alice Springs from there, so I'm guessing it's not the easiest having to drive for 9 hours a weekend to visit Woolies/Maccas/etc once a week. I'm also guessing, seeing the number of resorts in such a small town, that the tourists completely overwhelmed the local population."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As someone who has (and still does) lived in Darwin their whole life, I encourage all Aussies to read what this person has to say. The issues facing Alice Springs, as well as the NT as a whole, are incredibly complex and will not be solved by the restrictions on alcohol alone. These problems have existed for as long as I have lived here (I‚Äôm almost 30) and if you speak to any Territorian, they are progressively getting worse. Crime/antisocial behaviour/public drunkenness is so prevalent in public spaces, complacency and desensitisation by onlookers to incidents (that can sometimes occur right in front of them) is sadly quite common. Unfortunately, the people that cause this antisocial behaviour have the result of generations neglect and failed policies by their own governments and sadly, their own people at times. Some of the stories that have arisen in the media of recent times are heartbreakingly real and are the daily lives of people in a ‚Äúfirst world country‚Äù. How do you fix this? There is no simple/easy solution or answer - rather it WILL take all levels of Governments (local, state and federal - hell, even chuck the Opposition into this) working with First Nations Leader/s and NGOs to come up with a plan that is lead and managed by their own people. It‚Äôs easy to say this, but so so so hard to even begin this process. Education, health, housing, safety - these are basic human needs that are either severely lacking or even non existent for some. I love the NT - it is breathtaking beautiful and the lifestyle is truely unique (there is nowhere else like it in our country) but it‚Äôs changing and not for the better. I do not want to raise my children here long term and it‚Äôs sad to think that they may not have some of the experiences I got to have growing up here."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I appreciate this explanation, I've heard Alice Springs had a bad reputation plenty of times in my life but felt there had to be more of a reason for it."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Lol. Upvotes for suggesting Alice Springs (non) problems are a figment of Sky news imagination. Well at least we know Albo watches Sky. This is ROFL level nonsense. And so detrimental to any solution, by ignoring a problem, I‚Äôll tip my hat to you. Priceless."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,I second this. What people need to understand is that alcohol is a symptom of the problem not the cause - despite many high profile people declaring otherwise. The real issue is that over the last 15 years the federal and territory governments have reduced funding for services and programs in Alice Springs and communities to the point where there is no support. They blame alcohol because it‚Äôs an easy sell. But the reality is people drink to escape their suffering and if their life wasn‚Äôt so shit they wouldn‚Äôt drink.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"There's a small IGA and food is bonkers expensive there, even for Alice Springs prices, it made sense for one of us to drive to Alice on a weekend and get everyone's groceries, the town fluctuates between 200-600 people unless the Camel cup is on but its a transient population of 80% tourists out to see kata/uluru A pint at the pub was 12 bucks or so, so not cheap, but not inner city prices either, in terms of entertainment, you make your own, there is 4g in town which is fairly stable so streaming / Netflix is fine but once you've done all the tourism things to do, you either really enjoy walking in the desert for fun or you spend all your time at the local in honesty. Virtually nothing in the way of fast food, it's essentially 2 restaurants and neither is cheap so you do cook a lot"

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was on a 'round Australia tour in the early 90s and that included Alice Springs. From memory we arrived in the morning, saw some sights, left in the afternoon to head to THE Alice Springs (ie, the waterhole that the town is named after, I had a drink, was good) and then we kept going until dusk and camped well away from the place. I don't recall the vibe, this being 30+ years ago, but I do recall the fortifications on some of the shops. I don't know what the answer is, but I can bet it won't be cheap, easy or fast. My sister has lived in Carnarvon, Norseman and Kalgoorlie, a niece lived in Karratha, they weren't as bad as Alice but none of them live there now as things got steadily worse over time."

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Anyone who thinks they or anyone else should be treated differently when it comes to the laws or anything else, because of the colour of their skin, is racist. Why should aboriginal people receive money, houses, their own free healthcare, reduced sentences, free rides left right and centre, and why should everyone have to put up with their absolute bullshit, just because they are aboriginal? If all the shit that goes on in Alice Springs went on in Brisbane for example, every single person involved would be arrested and put in front of the courts and have permanent record etc‚Ä¶.but most of the offenders (the majority of which are aboriginal) in Alice Springs just get let out again and again and again with a slap on the wrist. Someone‚Äôs gonna crack it one day and just mow down a whole group of these offenders, and then there will be the usual crying ‚Äúhow could someone do this, our poor babies were perfect and did nothing wrong, the government didn‚Äôt do enough for us, we don‚Äôt get looked after enough because we are black‚Äù. How about you take a look at your fucking selves. This is an aboriginal problem. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,If there ever is a purge movie set in Australia it has to be in Alice Springs
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"At this point I can't think of a single positive contribution NT makes to the country aside from temperature records, cyclones and stranded/lost tourists. Uluru is the tourism equivalent of a stripper - in which you can only look from a distance and touching is a crime. (Still welcome to pay money though!) A lot of their major population centers are some of the most crime-afflicted in the country and occasionally the world . (Alice Springs was briefly 17th or so globally, and Tennant Creek is nationally famous for how awful and unsafe it is.) It's a hot take but I don't know why we keep letting the NT suck up money and then sook when nothing works. The money should be diverted to build social housing and infrastructure in states that pull their own weight and desperately need the accommodation. Either that, or we get a federal intervention as every successive state government appears to be useless. The NT is some kind of Rube Goldberg Machine in which federal funding is input and crime, red sand and inflammatory news articles are the output. Darwin is basically the exception to all of this, as we needed somewhere to be the capital. But instead of being attacked by criminals you get attacked by tropical cyclones and humidity never thought possible."
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,This thread insinuates some sort of cultural plight. Elders want this curfew. Aboriginal people are the largest victim of all of these violent acts happening in Alice. Some of the racism being spewed here is astonishing. This isn‚Äôt the law vs indigenous. It is indigenous seeking help from the law. Young people in poverty and addiction are violent. Alice Springs is also not the NT. I live here. I love it. The indigenous population are not defacto pro crime. They want help from being victims of it. And before any of you say ‚Äòwell why do they keep committing it?‚Äô‚Ä¶ maybe have a think as to how culpable or responsible you are for a crime committed against you by your own race. Because that kind of victim blaming is insane.

But yeah...they started off like those kids there in Alice Springs. No hard repercussions so they got bolder and pushed more boundaries untill it was too late.

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"First of all, thanks for not just immediately jumping on the 'I hope this bloke gets shivved in Alice Springs' dogpile. Crime sucks. There are no winners. It is one of the worst things about the human race. There is no 'nice way' of dealing with it IMO. Restorative justice does often result in better victim satisfaction per one of the sources I posted above, but you can't un-stab somebody, and you can't un-burn down someone's house. It's about a least-worst approach. There are always going to be people who are irredeemable, who commit acts of cruelty with no remorse, and yeah, lock them up for life AFAIC so we can study them and identify them at birth. I like to think that most crimes are committed by good people who have had hard lives or made bad choices and that the overwhelming majority of criminals can be saved. The hard pill to swallow is that maybe a victim's personal sense of revenge or justice isn't really that relevant. That is not something I say lightly. I don't think most of us, deep down, really want to inflict suffering on another human being, even one who has wronged us. I think most victims of crime feel the way I felt. Just really sad, and frustrated, and really wanting to make sure it didn't happen again. I don't think I ever really thought 'I hope they torture the bastard' or anything like that. Crime is complicated."

The question is how do we quickly instill this in all Sorts of communities. It starts with parents and norms in a community and it‚Äôs those peers that have to say what is not acceptable that‚Äôs when good change can happen quickly inside a generation.

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"> Alice Springs Town Campers are proud of who they are and the struggle they are involved in to be recognised as an important part of the Alice Springs community. They recognise that not everyone understands their struggle or their pride in who they are, including other Aboriginal people in Alice Springs. They say people are always looking at what is wrong with Town Camps and fail to see the strength and bonds that have been forged through years of struggle. They say they struggled for years to create their living spaces, through gaining leases and forming Housing Associations under the Tangentyere umbrella, and to maintain their control over how these Town Camps were run. They tell us that a report just prior to the Intervention assessed them against 10 standards that had been established as benchmarks of housing performance. They say they scored above the National average on 7 of these and were at the average on one and only failed to meet these benchmarks on two. They say they can‚Äôt understand the logic of, in their words, ‚Äúcollapsing a successful housing management program‚Äù and replacing it with a system that has not produced anywhere near the same outcomes over the past 10 years. >In their view, all the current difficulties are a direct result of the Federal Government decision to remove their control over the leases as part of the Emergency Response (the Intervention). They say this meant that their previous slow, but gradual growth in managing their living spaces, was removed for a political decision that has not benefited them in any way. Prior to the forced relinquishment of their leases to the Commonwealth, they say they managed difficult residents, using trespass notices. The process was that the relevant housing association would come together, usually with the tenant, and see if it was possible for them to change their behaviour. If the tenant was willing to make changes, no eviction. If the tenant was unable to change they made a collective decision, and the offending tenant was issued with a trespass notice. The Town Campers say it worked well. https://tfhc.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/452564/Town-Camps-report_F_Section_Town-camps_Part-D.pdf"

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Good article on SBS, last year. >The reality is that Alice Springs' problems began with the forced removal of Aboriginal people from their lands. They are the result of government policies of genocide, assimilation, neglect, and then, intervention. What is driving all of this current attention and faux concern is the elephant in the room - racism. [https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/opinion-this-is-another-externally-imposed-intervention/c0d1i4buz](https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/opinion-this-is-another-externally-imposed-intervention/c0d1i4buz) My personal summary (Not unique to Alice Springs, but applicable to it). * Aboriginal people were removed from their traditional land over decades, and forced to live in ""town camps"" on the outskirts of Alice Springs (because ghettoes or shanty towns would sound bad!) * Some Non-Indigenous people have been making either overtly or coded racist statements about the Aboriginal people living in the shanty towns (let's just call them what they are) pretty consistently ever since. * Occasionally we pretend to do something which is supposed to address the ""problem"" such as the ""Intervention"". * There is also the usual background noise of ""doing something about the problem"" in the form of over policing, over incarceration, with a dash of vigilantism and sporadic outbreaks of domestic terrorism including mass arson to trying to ""burn out"". * Occasionally someone gets an insane idea such as providing employment opportunities, infrastructure, allowing people to live on country rather than in shanty towns, anything that might actually do something about crushing inter-generational poverty. Naturally they plan everything from Canberra because consulting the actual people who live there would clearly be even more insane. So they spend money on programs that achieve sweet bugger all, then say ""Oh well we tried"" and go back to just pretending not to see their fellow Australians living in third world conditions. * I am going to be downvoted to hell by people desperately not trying to say ""Well the actual problem is that all Aboriginals are some combination of child molesters>drunks and druggies>intellectually inferior>lazy>parasites here (while carefully trying to avoid using those exact words, usually)."

When my brother and I were little, Alice became Auntie Alice. She could always be found with one of us, and she used to sleep in the room we shared. When we were old enough to have separate rooms, she started sleeping in the spot that our rooms branched out from. She didn't play favourites, and placed herself where she could watch over her boys.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You must visit Uluru. Seriously the more you study it the more amazing the place is. Ulu·πüu , Mt Conner & The Olga‚Äôs all line up within 1 degree of each other. All roughly the same mass ( The Olga‚Äôs) are split into 27 individual rocks. The popular opinion is that they were volcanic & raised from below however extended periods of study & a little common sense will tell you they came from above . Mt Conner viewed from around 50 klm above, will display this the easiest to understand. Also the popular opinion from ‚ÄúThe Experts‚Äù is that the caves at the base of Ulu·πüu was caused from millions of years of water erosion as there was a inland sea at some stage backed up by fish fossils being found. However, if you follow the thought bubble of water erosion, you also have to believe that the water erosion was very disciplined as the Caves are so evenly spaced apart & of pretty much the same size. Also inside the caves, on the ceiling there are formations which the Experts say was caused by millions of years of water dripping down & calcification. However when I first saw them I immediately recognised them as a backbone. I guess 50 years ago some Expert came up with the water calcification thing and it stuck. Anyway I was out there for months Studying it up close & that was my take away. It is worth a visit, have a look & form your own thoughts. It‚Äôs around a 3-4 hour drive from Alice Springs but we‚Äôll worth the Visit. Do it wary on in your time in Alice otherwise it will be one of those things you never do.

Reddit/Damnthatsinteresting,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This ranking is not based on murder rate. It's based on 'crime index' which is essentially how the population perceives crime in the area, obtained through surveys. It says more about perceived safety rather than actual crime levels.

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great synopsis! Your comment about similar moves from country to city being indicative of wider changes has always rattled around in the back of my mind. I used to live in a small country town in the early 1990s, pop. ~500 in winter, then temporarily the tourists would boost the town to ~20,000 over summer. When housing and cost of living was relatively cheap my small country town was a low income inhabitant haven plus sea change families. Pot was pretty common and there was the very occasional social issue with someone not coping and losing their shit. But that all slowly changed with basic necessity price rises and suddenly more attractive financial options for property investment pushing many of the poorer permanent population out and cutting down on most opportunities for young folk just starting out in life. With the decrease in the quality of life for locals there appeared to be an increase in harder drugs and more antisocial behaviours. Plus the council got overrun by developers changing the whole cultural direction of the town, and the whole vibe of the town changed, delicate ecologies that attracted tourism were flattened and built on, and gentrification totally changed the local socioeconomic demographics. Turning it into essentially a summer time suburb for rich Sydney and Canberra folk who owned or could afford to rent a house, with very little off season culture compared to historically. And whenever I look into the changes happening in outback towns, and the similar time frames their changes have been occurring. It gets me wondering if the forces driving these increasingly undesirable social changes are a nation wide phenomena? And that vulnerable places like Alice Springs, or to a lesser extent the country town I used to live in, aren‚Äôt just the canaries in the coal mine for wider societal issues that are a consequence of the previous forty years of legislated changes, and political populism and perceived social priorities? My gut instinct is that whatever sociopolitical direction that would increase the viability of life in rural, remote and country towns, would also benefit communities like Alice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è hope that wasn‚Äôt too incoherent."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Another component that I think many people who lack local knowledge/experience of the Northern Territory's situation is how distance and isolation slow down + over-cost any response the government can take to achieve some of the constructive responses to problems you have highlighted. This is something that comes up a lot in the GST discussions over at the [Commonwealth Grants Commission](https://www.cgc.gov.au/) ([Indigeneity + distance](https://www.cgc.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-03/NT%20submission%20-%20Tranche%202_2025R.pdf) being factors that massively push up cost of providing government services) and is worth reading if you want to learn more about how hard these problems are to tackle. In 2022, [a third of houses were burned down in Wadeye](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-27/wadeye-port-keats-northern-territory-fighting/101018246) - which uprooted many people who were living there, and lead to the regions they moved to being under increasing stress. In a southern state with a larger population and where a town the size of Wadeye is both more common and typically a lot closer to other towns or cities, that's something you can take action to recover and address more quickly, cheaply and with a lot more trained people ""on-hand"". But for the NT government (which has less resources, funding and simply capable people - given its size), that's so much harder to do. Remote communities in the tropics are resource-stressed for many reasons; and if a major disruption or damage hits one, it can start a line of knock-on domino effects that are tinder to a matchbox. This is especially important because so many of the problems in the NT are intergenerational violence and abuse - and things like[ Covid made that worse](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajs4.183). And to be clear, I'm not saying that this is all covid's fault, or that it's all events like Wadeye's burning houses to blame. Rather, I'm hoping to get across that compared to other parts of Australia (many experiencing problems with youth crime and inter generational poverty!), the NT and places like Alice Springs are uniquely *fragile* to one or two big disruptions starting a snowball of worsening outcomes in those problems, and that's exactly what we have seen. That compounds the fact that the last time we had ""unity"" in attempt to do something (the Intervention), it was ineffective, motivated by [lies](https://newmatilda.com/2017/06/23/bad-aunty-seven-years-how-abc-lateline-sparked-racist-nt-intervention/) and did [real damage](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/148959) to the [*belief* and *trust*](https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/2106156/NT-Intervention-Evaluation-Report-2020.pdf) many people had in the federal government's ability to help. Which leaves us with Alice Springs where it is now: An absolute mess that will require not just money but a united, long-term commitment by government (and specialised resources beyond just money: skilled people, experts, policing and rehabilitation) - which we are unlikely to get. Nobody wants to think further than the next election cycle on this problem, and even if you see a brief moment of unity from state/federal/local governments it comes unstuck just as fast. That kills trust, and without trust in the system, even young kids in communities who might believe they have a future are going to (fairly ask): who's got their back trying to chase it?"

But I'm sure it's nowhere near the best small town in Australia that it once was. Having said that, it's wonderfully scenic, and the town has a LOT of facilities for a place of 30,000. OTOH, Rockhampton is pretty awful - lots of those sizeable Queensland cities are."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is probably the first time I've ever heard anyone genuinely compare Alice Springs against Paris.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Can't really compare it to big cities like Paris or Chicago. Alice Springs is more like a ghetto suburb. Hang around there and you will see the crime and social problems. Whereas you can stay in Paris or Chicago and never see anything because it all depends on what area you are in. By that metric Alice Springs is more dangerous because the entire town has problems, you can't go to a nice part of town to escape it."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"By global (western, developed nation standards) it is dangerous. You are much, much more likely to be affected by crime while visiting Alice Springs than Paris or Chicago. A lot of Aussies will poo pah this because they don't consider property/petty crime to be dangerous. But if someone tries to steal my car...that is a dangerous act If someone breaks into my home...that is a dangerous act If someone abuses me and threatens me for a smoke/money...that is a dangerous act."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Aussie who lives in Chicago here. Crime rates here are sensationalized (a lot of racism is involved there) and i have absolutely never felt unsafe on this city as a small woman. It‚Äôs not even on the top 5 most dangerous cities on the US. I have also visited Alice Springs and never felt unsafe. It is a little rough but if you‚Äôre smart it‚Äôs absolutely fine
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs is not as bad as people say it is, nothing like a place like Port Moresby. Yes it can get out of control at times and YouTube has loads of videos to show you these events in some areas and it's often at night. However I have been through there several times for work and saw no trouble and had no issues there."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I know someone who lives in Alice Springs, was born in the US and she says she feels safer than she does when visiting family in Colorado.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Another overly common question on this sub that almost needs its own pinned post. Alice Springs is like a suburb of one of Australia's cities.

Amsterdam, I countered with one per week in Alice Springs. He said ""So"". My reply, ""Alice Springs has a population of 25,000, what's the population of Amsterdam?"" 800,000 at the time. Back in the 90's Alice Springs was the Murder capital of the world. I don't know where it ranks now, but I'm guessing it's still top 10."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"In Paris it's literally just scams and pick pockets (ignoring that period when there was a terrorist stack every other month). Anyone with half a brain won't have issues in Paris. Couldn't comment on Chicago, can't imagine many Australians could. In Alice springs you can't go out after dark and need to keep your cars in secure parking etc. It's like visiting a relatively safe for tourists but very much third world country. No one is going to see you as a target or try to kidnap you but if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time you could find yourself in trouble."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"For reference Katherine and Tenant creek have a higher homocide rate than Detroit USA. Violent crime is absolutely rampant, people do get bashed in broad daylight. For example August has 98 Assaults not including DV, for a population of 33 thousand, that‚Äôs 296 per 100k, if we add the DV it jumps to 515 per 100k. All of QLD had 5,145 including DV, that‚Äôs a rate of 91 per 100k. You‚Äôre 3-6x more likely to be a victim of assault in Alice Springs than in QLD. If I jump down to Brisbane region, it‚Äôs 891 assaults, with a rate of 55 per 100k, so now it‚Äôs 6-10x more likely to be a victim of assault in Alice Springs than in Brisbane. Stats sources from NT PFES and QPS. ‚ÄúA bit more dangerous‚Äù is a wildly inaccurate take. As a Warlpiri man myself, the NT crime and assault rates are an absolutely a disgrace, if it was just petty theft crimes and car stealing, it‚Äôd be barely worth a mention. You don‚Äôt shut down a town and mass deploy police for a thievery problem like in mid year riots lead too. Highest Homocide rate, Assault rate, sexual assault rate and DV rate in the nation. There‚Äôs a reason why I got TF out, I know more people on first name basis in prison for genuinely violent crimes than most Australians can name cricketers from the last 30 years."

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It‚Äôs because there‚Äôs been this push of seeing Aboriginals as being different and separate to just falling under the banner of ‚ÄòAussie‚Äô. Naturally, that will create an ‚Äòus vs them‚Äô environment. Moreover, people see footage from Alice Springs showing feral behaviour and crime all over social media and it just seems so outrageous that people are genuinely disgusted by what they see. Then the whole Voice vote brought all of these feelings to the surface and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre seeing some people just snap who have had enough. Then when they verbalise how they feel they will of course sometimes exaggerate to make their disgust seem as elaborate and over the top as they can make it."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,What‚Äôs going on in Alice Springs?
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,The coverage of events in Alice Springs is sure to have influenced thoughts. But I cannot say I have noticed any increase of racism but maybe it is where I work and live
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Yeah well a group of aborigines recently killed a nice young white man recently for telling them not to litter. They committed a crime, he told them not to, they killed him. Repeat ad infinitum. E.g. the Danish backpacker who got stomped out shortly after arriving in Alice Springs by an aboriginal out on bail. This + welcome to cuntry."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Im admittedly slightly racist. Not in a direct way. I've never discriminated against a person for the colour of their skin. But I do not like or respect aboriginals. To answer your question on why. - they consistently take from the system. Grants, money, welfare, all from taxpayers. Yes, they were mistreated severely years ago. But as a migrant to this country, that wasn't me nor my family. Why should I have to pay for the mistakes of British settlers. - they have every advantage in every aspect of everything. They can hunt any animal they want, they get preference treatment in jobs, in schools, universities, medical facilities, they can enter national parks for free and kill protected animals. They have their own court and some laws don't even apply to them? - they're more violent and criminal than the rest of society. Look at the crime rates of aboriginals. It's ludicrous. How do we just accept what they do in Alice Springs? - every encounter I've had with an aboriginal is negative. As a teenager they were anti social and violent. As an adult they have screwed me when I allowed them to rent my house and caused thousands in damage. - they are constantly looking for handouts. They've figured out the system is virtue signalling and are fully playing into it for the advantages they recieve. - welcome to country at every. single. Opportunity. Is this necessary? To be forced to sit through a welcome to country all the time? Its ridiculous. At the right times it's a beautiful thing. My partner got a citizenship and they did one at the ceremony, it was done by an aboriginal who did some traditional dances and stuff and it felt right. It doesn't feel right when Karen from HR does a welcome to country every time a meeting is held. - white people seem to continuously push this agenda, if you feel obliged to help aboriginals Go and volunteer or sacrifice your own income to help them. Don't drag others into it. Being forced to embrace something you don't really believe in causes resentment. - most of the people in Australia have done nothing to aboriginals and owe them nothing ! This is becoming a greater % as immigration. I get that the British descendants may want to pay reparations in the form of welfare to aboriginals. But this is not the responsibility of the immigrant to funnel our tax dollars into this cause. Ultimately I do not care about aboriginals as long as they don't take my tax dollars for anything and don't commit crimes against me and don't get special laws made just for them."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I think it comes down to a build up of reasons: 1) The Voice disaster 2) the continuous land claims, which are often granted 3) the huge amount of benefits, like government money, directed jobs, scholarships, free TAFE 4) Welcome to the Country (even some Aboriginal groups think it's over the top 5) All the news articles and videos regarding Aboriginal violence, especially in Alice Springs 6) the constant pandering of Labor & Greens 7) the high crime rate, and nothing seems to be done about it 8) If you criticise any Indigenous, even whe in its warranted, you are called Racist. 9) the greedy and claiming everything is Sacred so they can either claim the land or get a payout, and prevent tourists or Australians from enjoying land, which was previous available 10) the demand to rename places There are likely more reasons, but these are the main ones"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,The crime in Alice Springs may influence attitudes
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I can't say I've noticed the same. Comments sections have always been skewed by racist keyboard warriors. Perhaps Location has a bit to do with your personal perspective on this? Growing up in a small country town in Victoria in the 80s i heard heaps of racist comments towards indigenous people and just as much back the other way. Now it is the exception rather than the norm. But this perspective would no doubt be different if i lived in Alice Springs for example. A lot of old racist bastards have died off, and a lot are in nursing homes now being cared for by the races they hated on all their lives which is gloriously ironic."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's complicated. On one hand, they are legitimately reeling from the Stolen Generation trauma. It is not easy. The people who were displaced turned to substance abuse as a method to cope. This has a flow-on effect. Abuse within communities happens. The Australian government's just taken a backseat and refuses to get involved in the fears of being seen in the same light as the same apartheid freaks that ran the Australian government. I remember reading an article where an Indigenous elder was in support of completely banning alcohol altogether around Alice Springs, but the government was like 'Nah we'll look genocidal.' Indigenous cultural values also differ vastly from Australian expectations. There needs to be a reconciliation. Young Indigenous boys aged 12 drop out of hogh school because they become 'men'. Again, no offense to them but I'm Muslim - we technically become men once we hit puberty or we reach the age of 15. Same thing applies with Judaism, but 99% of us reconciled it with the Australian rule of law that states a person reaches legal adulthood when they turn 18. Something has to give. And let me just say, I'm no expert. And I could very well be wrong."

Reddit/darwin,Alice Springs Desert Park,"there were hundreds , if not thousands of children exposed to dv in Australia last night. Alice Springs is not unique."
Reddit/darwin,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A) Discourse about DV in Indigenous communities is mainstream. No one is seriously afraid of being considered racist for engaging with this issue. B) NT prisons are bigger than ever, and overcrowded (more prisoners than beds). The new government has pledged to build yet another prison, growing capacity by 50% over the next five years. C) child removal rates in alice springs are higher than they were before the apology to stolen generations - more than double the national rate. if concerns over racism, ramping over-representation of prisoners and increasing rates of child removal were dominating discussion about DV, we'd see less racism, less prison for petty crimes and fewer child removals. Some people might use these excuses to avoid the problem, but that attitude certainly does not dominate."
Reddit/darwin,Alice Springs Desert Park,">So there shouldn't be any sort of inquiry? Where did I say this? The exact opposite actually, Any investigation should rely on facts and not sensationalism. >I understand that perhaps the numbers are over sensationalised and ""racists"" misinterpret and exaggerate the numbers for their own agenda. The discrepancies are still pretty bad. As per the health index. I said the discrepancies are bad. But over exaggeration does no help. >Also its abit odd that even if its teenagers having sex amongst themselves, where did the STIs come from. To my understanding, only a few are transmitted through birth This is really interesting if you research it. The current syphilis outbreak for example in the NT can all be traved to one index case from Queensland. This person had sex with some from the the Alice Springs area approx 15 years ago. When you look at the charts and spread over that time, the syphilis outbreak literally spreads from Alice Springs upwards through the Territory jumping from community to community. One person visiting Alice Springs for example takes it back to their community and suddenly its a cluster in that community. When you see the charts you there's like a outbreak in Tennant Creek a few years after Alice, then Katherine a few years after, the Darwin a few after that. It literally snakes up the stuart highway. The Darwin strain then become penicillin resistant making things even harder. And finally from Darwin and Katherine it spread out to Arnhem land. As for how it's spread amongst teenagers? teenagers fuck my dude. The age group of 15-24 is very active. And one 24 year old has sex with a 21 year old, that 21 year old has sex with an 18 year old, that 18 year old has sex with a 16 year old, and then suddenly there's huge spread amongst the 15-16 year olds. Part of my job is doing the contact tracing and its quite interesting seeing the circles develop, and how it takes just one person from the 18 year old circle hookup with someone from the 16 year old circles for both circles to become infected."

Most indigenous *actually do live in the cities and the towns* of This Fair Land, so they *do have access* to ""white man's law"" as you put it, including, crucially, the woman in the article. Alice Springs, the home of the woman on which the article is based, has [native title claims coexisting with federal claims](https://www.clc.org.au/index.php?/articles/info/the-arrernte-native-title-claim-in-alice-springs/), proving yet again that you don't know what you're talking about when you say ""completely separate from the rest of Australia"". My core point is really this: please don't make stuff up in your head and then spread it around as fact. The system is failing these people. Please don't scupper their chances of improving their lives by dismissing them on the fantasies in your head."
Reddit/OldPhotosInRealLife,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Northern Territory of Australia's archives online has this photo in the Smith Collection, under 'Aboriginal Peoples' (Australian) with no further info. [https://hdl.handle.net/10070/721715](https://hdl.handle.net/10070/721715) What I see, is the hills south of the Alice Springs Telegraph Station, a housegirl I know to be Dolly on the right, and a Telegraph Pole in the background... Could be a Frank Gillen Photo or a Thomas Bradshaw photo. I am leaning towards Frank Gillen, because he was very friendly with the Arrernte, and Dolly (on the right) was his favourite. He made heaps of photos with Dolly in it. He also bothered her for nude photos but his wife had instilled a firm Christian 'no' to that... That didn't stop him because I have seen her in several nude photos in the guise of 'typical native' anthropological photos. Anyway, the 'tells' that show me where this might be, were/are difficult to see... The only way to find this was to take photos home and study them on the computer, to look for rocks that might match. To get to the right place I just follow vertical lines in the photo until they converge at the camera. The Telegraph pole in the picture puts the date at after April 1899. In relocating the line here with an extra copper wire was the last thing Frank Gillen did, before handing over to his replacement, Stationmaster Thomas Bradshaw. Thomas Bradshaw initially tried to avoid the role of 'Protector of Aboriginals' and tried to palm it off to the local Mounted Constable. Gillen was rope-able, because hew reckoned the policeman was always either drunk or recovering from being drunk. Gillen therefore thought good relations would go downhill, hence Bradshaw taking photos of Arrernte in their camp seems less likely. More likely Gillen took photos of his Arrernte friends before he left. Dolly was taken over by Bradshaw as housegirl (nanny housemaid), but the Bradshaws soon 'let her go', whereas Gillen's photos of Dolly smack of infatuation. I spotted stripy jumpers on jockeys at the racecourse and that makes sense. Frank Gillen is Stipendary Magistrate and president of the region‚Äôs turf club. The region is about the size of France and only has a few hundred white people in it. He probably bought the jumpers for the club so they ended up at the Telegraph Station. The housegirls were not paid but did receive goods in lieu of payment‚Ä¶ By finding the correct location we can also learn that the women‚Äôs camp was right alongside the Main North Road. The Telegraph Track from Adelaide to Port Darwin. The occasional traveler became a stream of miners around 1904 when gold was found at Winnecke goldfields. The open area beside the track here was also a camp arra used by travelers and the Cameleers with their 60or so camels of the supply ‚Äòcamel trains‚Äô. The camel smell upset the horses and cattle kept at the Station yards, and therefore had to stay some distance away. Camping near the women appeared to be a mutually agreeable arrangement‚Ä¶ Cameleers also hawked or traded knickknacks, tobacco, pipes, scarves and haberdashery. So every time I find an old photo location I learn something new."
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As an Alice Springs resident for 10 years, this was expected to occur. But this does nothing but waste taxpayers' money on something that might work for a short period and push that crime out into the suburbs. Mainly this has resulted from the Facebook page aliceforaction2020 putting a blanket of fear on the town by posting every single little of crime. it's mostly theft and assaults that happen sporadically but because of the small population size it makes it stick out like a sore thumb. it brings the most racist and vile people to the page, just go to all comments and you'll have people talking about open carrying and wanting to hurt kids."

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Did you see the 80 person violent riot and stabbing? Fear and force are what innocent people in Alice Springs are experiencing. Decent people are afraid to go out at night. I guess you could keep asking nicely for another year. That has worked out pretty well.
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Look you both are right to some extent. Sure the lost generation was not even that long ago and that it was horrendous. For that you are correct. However he is also correct in saying aboriginals need to look inward to adapt to the new world. The world is not the same as it was even 20 years ago. Everyone needs to adapt, it should not be white vs aboriginal. White people wouldn't have been successful in mapping some of the territory without them and the aboriginals wouldn't have western medicine or western amenities like cars, horses etc. Alice Springs in the top 20 dangerous cities in the world (might be top 40) but that is not acceptable especially when a lot of funding is put towards the community and the elders need to be held accountable."

And what were the scope of the bans, whose absence has now caused the issues, apparently? I know the ABC gotta cover stuff as it happens, but don't put such loaded sentences in an article without actual evidence or backing-assertions. NT was/is introducing their own laws to cover the intervention ending, so I genuinely don't know enough about NT to actually say Wtf is happening, but this situation went from ""not an issue (even though crime was increasing in 2021 and 2022)"" to ""we need to send the fucking ARMY in t.

That‚Äôs the whole point. Karvelas: But the voices were telling you ‚Äì they might not have been enshrined in the constitution, minister, but they were telling you and the Northern Territory government that things were going to explode. Burney: Which is why we are responding, which is why there was substantial money committed in the budget towards central Australia.

Add more opportunities out in Alice Springs and the surrounding areas. We can throw 27 billion dollars on a peer, we can fund rural communities country wide. Build malls, hospitals, road and rail. Build things in these communities, give them hope. ***A number of local Aboriginal groups issued statements on Tuesday, many expressing concern about the potential for a knee-jerk government response.*** ***The group representing the town's Arrernte traditional owners said the current crisis was the result of Intervention policies and decades of ""chronic and systemic neglect"" of remote communities.*** ***They said Arrernte in Alice Springs had watched poverty, inadequate housing and under-investment in remote schools and health services force people to abandon their home communities and move into town.*** Which is why these communities have such high amounts of alcoholism. They aren't benefiting from the same Australia we are, instead they're left to rot. These areas need modern 21s century city planning. We need to modernise Australia, now. We can do it. We throw billions at dumb stuff constantly. ***Earlier in the day NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker said greater investment in social services, especially to remote communities, was needed to address the under-lying issues exacerbated by alcohol.*** ***Crime statistics released yesterday showed a more than 50 per cent increase in commercial break-in's, property damage and alcohol-related assault in the past year.*** ***There was a 53 per cent increase in domestic violence-related assaults in Alice Springs.*** Pretty easy to figure out in the end, why people drink and why people steal.

But even here in Geelong, there is a massive poverty problem. If there's a poverty problem so ingrained in Geelong, i can only imagine Alice Springs. Hell Sunshine, who here's been to Sunshine? It's literally where the sun doesn't shine. That's got a massive Vietnamese and Sudanese community, and the place probably 10 years ago, looked like a actual warzone. Burnt cars on the sides of roads, trash everywhere, shops smashed in, constant stabbings and murders, gunshots and gang fights not different from Corio and Norlane. In Australia.

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I don't think it ""brought the crazies out"", but when you poke shit the flies swam. These remote communities have never been nice, the effects of alcohol and many other social and economic factors have always been around. Alice Springs banning alcohol is far from unprecedented, there are heaps of dry communities out there (they're much nicer too, anecdotally). The problem is that the debate about the voice is about these issues. More Aboriginal people live in SEQ than the NT, but because that's normal suburbia, it doesn't make a good story. Remote Australia is like a different country. Poor education, intermittent (to put it generously) services and no opportunities. It is actually shocking to see coming from a coastal city. Visibly pregnant teenagers, barred windows on every shop, intoxicated people at 9am etc... It's scary. Alien and scary. Xenophobia of what lies within our borders. Now this could go either way for the voice, the shame could make some people vote for or the fear some people against. But either way this is a problem with regional Australia, not Aboriginal people."

Reddit/travel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,I just went to Kakadu last week. I went just in a day tour though with AAT Kings. It was quite expensive and was a lot of driving from Darwin for one day. I'd suggest renting a car or maybe just finding a bus or something that can do one way. There are campsites and resorts etc in Kakadu as I'm sure you are aware. I'm not sure about exploring solo as I have never done it nor really have I thought about it. It's truly beautiful there and there are people around all the time at the popular spots in the parks.
Reddit/darwin,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"Day 2 - you could do jumping crocs on your way out to jabiru. Go to cahills crossing first and then do ubirr for sunset! I would squish your day 3 & 4 activities in together. Get up super early and drive to cooinda and do the sunrise yellow water cruise, then do the rock art sites on your way back. Or do the opposite and drive to cooinda and do the sunset tour, if you want to stay there. Then day 4 do a waterfall tour - think I did a tour with Kakadu tourism, Kakadu adventure tour. Fogg dam is nice for wildlife watching but think you probably need a good hour or so. Why lake Bennett? Are you going to stay there and use as base for Litchfield? I would stay at Litchfield overnight and have a bit more chill time there. And do Florence & buley on day 6 and then Wangi and other waterfalls on day 7 - You can also do the cascades if you‚Äôre both willing to walk a bit."
Reddit/darwin,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"I would slot Fogg dam into your Day 2 itinerary in the morning on the way through to Jabiru tbh since unless you plan to do the walks you‚Äôll likely not spend more than an hour max at Fogg dam. Then you could go down the Kakadu Hway to Pine Creek from Jabiru on your way back, then come up to Lake Bennett. That‚Äôll also bring you passed Adelaide River with the war memorial if you‚Äôre into that For Day 3 you might be best giving yourself the afternoon off if it‚Äôs a particularly hot day, since the walk around Nourlangie can take it out of you a bit."
Reddit/darwin,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"1. The best time to be at Nawurlandja is sunset. 2. Do the Nanguluwurr walk at Nourlangie. Early morning if possible - it can be super spiritual being there alone. 3. Kubara pools walk, on a separate fork down the road to Nourlangie, is a nice walk. 4. If the Nourlangie Barrk walk is open in August, I would count it as a MUST do. Even the first little bit where you ascend to the top of the outlier, which takes about 30 minutes. 5. Ubirr can be super hot during the middle of the day, would highly recommend morning or afternoon to beat the crowds (it's one of the busiest attractions). Honestly when there's a lot of other people at these places in Kakadu it completely fucking ruins it. It is COMPLETELY different for example when I was there during COVID and I'd rock up to a place nine times out of ten and there was no one else there. 6. Scenic flight over Jim Jim/Twin in a helicopter is pretty speccy (from Jabiru) 7. Maguk is 2WD accessible. if you're adventurous you can also drive to the 4WD trailhead (the last ~5km of the track in) at Jim Jim and hitch a ride in with some other people."
Reddit/darwin,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,My advice for getting the most out of Kakadu - try and do the wetlands and falls early in the day. Sunrise over the wetlands is amazing - just you (if you are lucky) and the birds. You will see other wildlife at this time too. Same with the falls. Being at Jim Jim alone is an intense experience. You will see beautiful things either way but going early beats most tourists and the heat of the day.

Reddit/darwin,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"If I had one whole day I‚Äôd go into Kakadu via Kakadu hway from pine creek and have a swim at barramundi gorge, then you can do a boat tour at yellow water, continue up to the border of arnham land to see the crocs at cahills crossing and head back to Darin via arnham hway stopping in at Ubir to see the rock art and this is a great spot to watch the sun go down.

Reddit/australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"As someone commented, the term originated in Canada, but I don't see why it can't be used in Australia. For one thing, it's First Nation**s** plural, since as you point out Aboriginal people are not one homogenous group. Looking up the definition of 'nation' gives me ""a body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory"". I don't see why that couldn't apply to each tribe. Different people will prefer different terms but some find 'First Nations' or 'First Peoples' more respectful than 'Aboriginal' or 'Indigenous'. Obviously it's not a traditional Aboriginal title, but neither are the terms ""Aboriginal"" or ""Indigenous"". It would certainly be nice if people used more specific tribe/nation names where possible though. I understand the traditional owners of Kakadu are Bininj and Mungguy."
Reddit/australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"Just to elaborate on /u/YinaarGomeroi , it's First NATIONS. It is a good term to describe Aboriginal peoples because of the diversity of language and culture. Australia is HUGE and a place like Kakadu is VERY unique with its own seasons, animals, landscape and resultant way of life. A way of life completely different to how the people in say the Darling / Barwon river area or the people on the south east QLD coast would have lived.

Reddit/australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,Can sacred areas be fenced off or incur a penalty without a traditional guide? I've lived in NT for 2 years. Never gone to Kakadu. Can we be given proof of the disrespect so we can work together for public access and fix these problems? What is this about?
Reddit/australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"Too bad, the people of Kakadu and Arnhem Land know where they stand. Its not just a fucking religion. Its the wrong word to use. Its their way of life and every bit of it developed in unison with the land and the insights it revealed over 60000 years."
Reddit/australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"> The Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority alleges the track was illegally constructed close to a restricted sacred site without an Authority Certificate. >Today in Darwin Local Court, prosecutor Ray Murphey said he wanted to know ""whether the defence concedes"" that custodians made it known where the track was not to go, on the day of a site visit. > The court heard the sacred site in question was a men's site, which under Aboriginal law and custom was not allowed to be viewed by women and children. >""The offence we say, your Honour, [is] that the custodians have taken the defendant and its agents to the area where the path was constructed, they've told them where the path can go, and the defendant ‚Ä¶ [has] nonetheless expended millions of dollars of taxpayers money and constructed the path next to that significant feature of the sacred site,"" he said. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-06/aboriginal-artefacts-returned-to-nsw/100111914 The article goes on to explain that Parks Australia are trying to hide behind Commonwealth Constitutional immunity to do what they like - > But lawyers for Parks Australia requested the case be adjourned, raising ""constitutional issues"" of Commonwealth immunity in relation to the Sacred Sites Act in Kakadu National Park. >""[Parks Australia] is not in a position to respond in full to these points until the constitutional issues are dealt with,"" defence lawyer Todd Herskope said."
Reddit/australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,The old track was relatively rough and possibly damaging to the environment. Looks like the new track is built over all the terrain. I'd guess its to make the major draw card of Kakadu a little more accessible for all. &#x200B; [this article has their reasoning](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-10/nt-gunlom-falls-stays-shut-due-to-potential-sacred-site-damage/12440690)
Reddit/australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,You can't name them. Many of the sacred sites across the NT are heavily guarded and hidden and known only to locals. I back-country hike all the time in Kakadu and there are strict rules around where you are allowed to hike. You also aren't allowed to take pictures of the art and share them on social media unless its a known art site like Ubirr. The fact is if they named them to the general public and shared where they were then people would be trying to go no matter how many signs tell you not to.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,Kakadu will be very hot and coming into the storm season. I‚Äôd go Kangaroo island that time of year.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,Kangaroo Island. You want to go to Kakadu in July.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"November in Kakadu is the build-up, so it can be humid and oppressive without the relief of the rain coming through. Most of the sites will probably still be open, but you'll find it more difficult to get a tour to them and may need your own transport. And if you're not from the tropics you'll find the days quite exhausting in the heat."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,As everyone‚Äôs said Nov is not the time to visit Kakadu whereas Kangaroo Is will be great. We visited in January and had a fantastic time. You‚Äôll see the most wildlife at dawn or dusk.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,While Kakadu is far superior in my opinion that is not when you want to go there. Kangaroo island.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,Never been to Kakadu but I ADORE kangaroo island. My brother lived there for a few years and so I visited with and without my young kids. It was incredible every trip.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"I have spent a fair bit of time in both places and this is my take. KI will be more pleasant weather. A Mediterranean climate. Beautiful beaches and decent wild life. There are wineries and a few things to do but honestly, if you want to visit somewhere that might blow your mind kakadu is the place to go. It will be hot and uncomfortable but you will see big crocs at cahills and the fishing will be firing up so get a fishing rod and catch some barra. Indigenous culture is very strong so you will meet interesting people and the yellow water cruise cannot be topped in australia in my opinion. On your way to kakadu you can stop at the humpty doo pub and visit the jumping crocs. Feel free to ask questions if you have any."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"Kangaroo Island. Going to Kakadu in the Wet would be amazing but uncomfortable, and you wouldn't be able to see most of it anyway."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,Kakadu will be hot humid and possibly flooded in Nov. No thanks.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"November is very very intense at Kakadu. Even locals are hot, angry and over it at that time of year. If you really can stand the humidity it‚Äôs a kind of amazing experience and the sunsets tend to be even better cos of the humidity, but you honestly are so hot and the air feels oppressive and electric waiting for a storm that usually won‚Äôt arrive til December or Jan, it‚Äôs a very intense time. If you go all the way to Kakadu (via Darwin I assume?) try not to miss Litchfield- it‚Äôs amazing in its own way, the pair are spectacular."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"I appreciate the help. I'll be going to Uluru at some point, which from my past experience had a lot of Indigenous culture, as for the crocs...

Reddit/australian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,">By James Elton >**In short:** >Parks Australia has been handed a historic $200,000 fine after the Commonwealth agency pleaded guilty to exposing a sacred site at Gunlom Falls. >The waterfall has been closed to tourists since 2019, after a sacred men's site was damaged during the construction of a walkway. >**What's next?** >Traditional custodians say the popular site in the Northern Territory's Kakadu National Park will reopen to tourists next year."
Reddit/australian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"Fair enough it's a fed govt agency so the fine is ultimately paid by tax payers. So us tax payers are really asking Parks Australia North, PAN to do better. But there is a lot more nuance to the whole saga. Markham senior was a friend and work colleague for many years, we talked this issue though quite a few times. In the first instance the various sites had been well mapped and Anthropologicaly certified. PAN knew and had all that information. They did follow consulting process re location of the proposed walkway, impact(s) and cultural sensitivity. Then they went ahead and had it constructed in the wrong location contrary to what had been understood. More to it but that is the gist of it. M Markham and families were put under considerable pressure to keep Gunlom falls, campsite open, but with the track closed. But a very important point had to be made and a precedent underlined and set in stone. So no deal. Topend and Katherine region tourism suffered, operators had to redesign itineraries etc etc. BUT first nations people and the custodians had full support from the vast majority of tourism interests. As an aside, the only reason PAN is the 'governing' body in Kakadu is because of its world heritage status. Elsewhere in the NT it's parks and wildlife. An outstanding group of professionals with excellent trust and rapport with first nations people. So quite a few of the first nation's groups in and around Kakadu are not happy, comfortable or really trusting of PAN. Note World heritage status was not something that first nations custodians asked for. Government of the day pushed it ahead. It's a good thing in many ways, but PAN well maybe not so much."
Reddit/australian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,">A judge has handed down the largest fine in history under the Northern Territory's sacred site laws after a sensitive men's site was exposed at Gunlom Falls in Kakadu National Park. >The case centred on a walkway that Parks Australia constructed in 2019 to help visitors safely get to the top of the famous waterfalls. >Traditional owners supported a track, but not the route it took as it went within 10 metres of a sacred rock art site they said should only be seen and accessed by men. >Earlier this year, Parks Australia pleaded guilty to damaging the site and its director travelled to the falls to deliver an apology to traditional owners. >As the landmark on-country hearing ended on Wednesday, Judge Elizabeth Morris ordered Parks Australia to pay a $200,000 penalty for the breach. >It marks the first time a Commonwealth agency has been punished under the NT legislation. >""I note that this defendant should have conduct of the highest order and should be held to a standard that the public expects of one of its national institutions charged with managing our environment,"" Judge Morris said. >The judge said while Parks Australia had not been ""wilfully ignorant nor in complete disregard for the interest of the Jawoyn people"", she found the agency had not been ""in any way sufficient"" in its consultations with traditional owners to avoid the ""cultural disturbance of the site"". >During the extraordinary two-day sentencing hearing at the site, the court heard victim impact statements from senior members of three Jawoyn clans with deep connections to Gunlom Falls. >""I want my spirit to be happy, I want my ancestor's spirit to be happy,"" said Rachael Willika Kendino, a custodian of the Bolmo clan. >Joe Markham, another senior Bolmo custodian, described a feeling of ""powerlessness"" that came from not being able to fulfil his cultural obligations to care for the site. >""I felt I had failed,"" he told the judge. >Bernadette Calma of the Wurrkbarbar and Matjba clans said she had experienced a strong backlash from tourists since the site closed five years ago. >The judge said it was clear the traditional owners had suffered ""personal, cultural and community consequences"". >**Gunlom Falls to reopen next year** >Joshua Hunter, a senior Wurrkbarbar man who welcomed the judge to Jawoyn land, said visitors would be allowed back at the falls some time next year. >Ms Kendino said the country would ""heal"" as custodians ""speak to our ancestors"" and get back to teaching young people their customs. >She also said she looked forward to repairing the relationship with Parks Australia. >Director of National Parks Ricky Archer said the agency ""completely accepts"" the decision. >Mr Archer was not the director at the time of the track's construction but said he felt a great sense of relief the long-running legal saga, [which reached the High Court last year](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-08/nt-gunlom-falls-kakadu-high-court-decision-on-appeal/103818866), was finally resolved. >""As an Indigenous person, I take the protection of sacred sites to heart,"" he said. >Mr Archer, who thanked the Jawoyn people for their patience, said he looked forward to working with them on the falls' reopening."

Reddit/4x4Australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"You'll make Kakadu....it is mostly bitumen. As for cape york, stick to the main roads and avoid the offroad tracks. I had a mate who took a prius up to cape york. He put a higher profile offroad tyre on, had a 1 inch lift and dropped his tyre pressures and made it up to the tip. Just slow down on the corrugated roads. Good luck and enjoy it."
Reddit/4x4Australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"Don‚Äôt listen to people, we did a half lap of Aus in an MG and an AU falcon, the AU actually saved two bogged hiluxes just near Roxby downs. And dragged the MG along the beach up in the NT. Got invited out to a remote community in Kakadu and it was sketchy but made it fine. Get the biggest tyres you can fit, don‚Äôt be afraid to just foot down if you need to. Learn to straddle ruts. Some bloke did Cape York in a mondeo the other week. Pretty sure all that had was bigger tyres and new suspension, not lifted, just new so there was no sagging."
Reddit/4x4Australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"You can do 99% of the open sites in Kakadu with a 2wd. Twin falls and things like graveside gorge are probably pushing it, moline lower rock hole (but worst case scenario you can park slightly further away and walk the last like 500m)"
Reddit/4x4Australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,Short version> 2009 X-Trail (AWD). New to offroading. Got bogged on beaches. Tried some rough tracks. Car‚Äôs copping damage. Confidence gone. Can this car handle real offroad stuff like Kakadu or Gibb? Or am I just bad? Roast me so I can learn. ‚ÄîDude stuck on curbs
Reddit/4x4Australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"Cape York you can still do. I know a heap of people that have done it in the dry in 2wd sedans. It was a bit of a badge of honour back when I started out. Heaps of falcons and holdens and cortina‚Äôs made it to the top. My father done parts of Kakadu and the Daintree in his 1969 Holden panelvan. Pick your lines, pick your tides, pick your season. Only real modifications to the panelvan were an lsd and a bullbar. I‚Äôve still got the panelvan so it wasn‚Äôt destroyed, it just takes a good driver."

Reddit/Crocodiles,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to share something that I think is interesting :) This river is called ""Alligators River"" and it's located in Kakadu National Park, Northen Territory, Australia. There is a street crossing the river, when the water rises (only a few hours in the morning) all the fishes are jumping from side to side, so easy food for the crocodiles! Look how many, I could count like 30 of them!"
Reddit/Crocodiles,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,It‚Äôs the East Alligator River and runs the boundary between Arnhem Land and Kakadu National Park. The crossing is Cahill‚Äôs Crossing and is tidal. On the incoming tide mullet (fish) jump to traverse it and the crocs from the River gather :-)
Reddit/Crocodiles,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"No, it‚Äôs not. I just added some more accurate inofornation. There‚Äôs is no ‚ÄúAlliagators River‚Äù and it‚Äôs not in Kakadu NP. There are East, West and South Alligator Rivers and they‚Äôre each 100 odd km apart. There‚Äôs no street, it‚Äôs a tidal causeway."

Reddit/travel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,Must be. Did you do nice things up there in October? How long did you spend in Kakadu? Any storms? The waterfalls can be a bit acidic after the first rains
Reddit/travel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"We had an amazing time - we had three days in Kakadu and were there for the first storm of the wet season which was pretty amazing! We visited Ubirr, Nourlangie, Yellow Water, did an Arnhem Land day trip, scenic flight and the Warradjan Cultural Centre. Such an incredible place."
Reddit/travel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"That's a pretty good mix of things! I went up on the 8th of Feb. Did Litchfield, Kakadu (Barrk walk around Nourlangie, Yellow Water, Gubara, Yirmikmik, Ikoymarrwa etc), then Katherine (Butterfly gorge, Sweetwater etc). Amazing area I agree, I'm going to be looking to do some 2 night off track walks next time I go up.

Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"The drive from Alice to Yulara (Uluru) will take you around 5 hours, please do not drive this in the late afternoon or on dusk, as you will be driving into the sun and the Lasseter Highway is statistically one of the most dangerous roads in the NT. You will not need a 4wd for any of this area, but I would recommend a Camry or larger (a full size car). As you approach Uluru you can probably have some fun with 'fooluru' (Mount Conner) There is only Yulara at Uluru, regardless of where you choose to stay it is going to be not cheap, for family friendly look at Outback Lodge or the Campground. Remember the climb **is closed** so if you were planning on that, forget about it. If your budget extends far enough a helicopter flight over the rock is well advised. If you line up Darwin for a Thursday you will be able to experience the world famous Mindil Beach Sunset Markets. As for Kakadu, book yourself in at Cooinda for night one, do the yellow waters cruise for sunrise, then move yourself up to Jabiru for sunset at Ubirr and then take in Nourlangie the next day, make sure you have tough walking shoes for all of this, and carry water. I would also suggest you invest in some UHF CB Radio handhelds (you may be able to rent these) as they help communicate car to car on the roads, Channel 40 for trucks and 18 for RVs, you may also want to consider renting a Personal Locator Beacon."
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"4 days is too long for Uluru. Save one and include Litchfield (Wangi Falls, Florence Falls) on the Darwin leg. In Kakadu, don't miss a Yellow Water billabong cruise at Cooinda. The drives are long, take your time and enjoy the landscapes."
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,Yep. Litchfield is wonderful. If you can do the cruise (if it is still offered) at Kakadu. I loved it! Get your kids to keep an eye out for the jacanas. (lily walking little birds with huge toes.)
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"Kings cannoy is amazing, I liked it better than Uluru, the climb at the start is a bit challenging fitness wise, but once you do that its pretty flat the down hill the other side. Go first thing like before the sun and you get a great view of the sun bouncing off the cannyon. Your plan is pretty good, simliar to what I did. I'd go 6 days total in Alice leg, 2 in alice, 2 in kings canyon and 2 in Uluru including driving as there is stuff on the way to do. Darwin has some great attractions, heaps of WW2 stuff, and the croc cage is awesome. If you got some more time Katherine and Katherine Gorge is pretty good to, it's only a few hours below Kakadu."
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"I can highly recommend part of a trip we did. We went from Darwin to Litchfield, to Kakadu, into gove (have family there) the down to Alice. From Alice we spent a day trip out to the east Macdonald ranges, then out to the west Mac's, staying at Redbank gorge, then we got bored there after 2days and went to palm valley, I loved palm valley and would say it is a must. Then there is a little town near the road into palm valley, at the local shop/servo you can buy the permit to do the mereenie loop (sort of a short cut to Kings canyon. Then from Kings down to Uluru and Kata juta. I thought Bulli rock hole at Litchfield was awesome we stay at Florence falls campground, and you could go to Bulli after all the tourist bus's have left and just about have to place to yourself. Mataranka is good for a night, the springs are better at bitter springs, but the caravan park at mataranka hot springs put on a show every night which is a nice change. Katherine gorge was good but I wouldn't go back. King canyon is a must, it's insane the scale of it, be prepared for a big walk, but it's worth it, I also thought Kata juta was better than Uluru but that's probably because it's less touristy, we did a sunset helicopter flight over both, and it was amazing. I know this is a bit all over the shop, but I will say if you want to stay at any of the public camp spots like Redbank, Florence falls, or Palm valley, make sure you get there early as the spots get filled up very early. And the private parks at Kings canyon and Yulara (Uluru) checking wait time was about an hour at both. But the water pressure in the showers at Kings canyon was worth the wait."

Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Nitmiluk NP is very scenic, but sort of a one-trick pony - with a series of red-rock gorges. Kakadu has a lot more variety, and a lot more crocodiles! The Yellow Waters cruise at Cooinda is wonderful. There's not a lot of difference in the travel times between the two."
Reddit/RitaFourEssenceSystem,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"In my GG i talked with Rita about my fears of losing my style when travelling. I tend to end up in Lost Girl mode when I‚Äôm dressing only for practicality. Extravagant was one of the keywords she gave to help me consider my style needs. This helped me create an incredibly satisfying outfit for this day trip. Situation: very long road trip to Nitmiluk National Park, hiking at Katherine Gorge and a swim at Leliyn (Edith Falls). I wanted to look bright, intentional and badass for this adventure. I planned around the purple crop, which I knew would be more comfortable to hike/swim in than a bikini top. The chunky necklace is lightweight and not fiddly. I discovered the black denim shorts aren‚Äôt great for steep climbs but they were fine for the gentler sections of the 7km trail. I was almost going to pick a no-nonsense practical shirt, but decided to go tropical instead, like some kind of shipwrecked fool wandering in the desert. The checked red cord shirt protected against the morning chill. Keywords: elemental+extravagant, intriguing+dramatic. Slide 2: welcome to Jawoyn Country. The national park is managed by its traditional owners, who have been using the area continuously for more than 40,000 years. It is known as Nitmiluk. ‚ÄúNitmi‚Äù translates to cicada, luk is ‚Äúplace of‚Äù. I‚Äôve included some of my favourite photos from the day here for a sense of context."
Reddit/spaceporn,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Live in NT near Nitmiluk. 420am now. Clear skies. Can confirm.
Reddit/whereintheworld,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Nitmiluk Gorge?
Reddit/OutdoorAus,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Hi would you accept a story about Nitmiluk National Park in the NT? And when‚Äôs the deadline
Reddit/darwin,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Unfortunately this time of the year many spots are cut off due to the rain. Still plenty of water holes etc they just might not be ‚Äòoff the beaten track‚Äô. Nitmiluk is awesome during the wet season, southern rock hole is a great swimming spot with a waterfall, you can hike in or get a little boat (some hike in and boat out). The gorge itself is beautiful. Litchfield has plenty of spots, try Green Ant water hole etc. hopefully others can give you some more tips. Enjoy the NT"
Reddit/darwin,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Kakadu is still very closed and most of it won't be open until July. Id go with Litchfield since you want swimming but most campsites are probably booked out since it's school holidays but you can try online. So Katherine might be your best bet you just need to walk to any swimming hole or catch an expensive ferry Umbrawarra is a good option as well if there are spots.
Reddit/Bushwalking,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"I haven't tried for the Jatbula, but experience similar issues for other hikes (like Thornsborne Trail, Hinchinbrook) they're super popular and disappear in an instant. In QLD commercial/group permits are generally a separate system (on top of private bookings). Looks like you might be able to convince NT Parks that you are seasoned hikers (as a group) and hike outside the regular season; >If you wish to walk out of season, you must be an experienced group or organisation. https://nt.gov.au/parks/find-a-park/nitmiluk-national-park/nitmiluk-national-park-jatbula-trail 1 week outside of 'the' season might still be ok for experienced walkers? It most definitely sucks, especially when people cancel a week before, but that's not enough time (for most people) to drop everything and make use of the free slot."
Reddit/darwin,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"I‚Äôd suggest hiring a car; I think just about everywhere will offer several days rental and it would make Darwin A LOT easier to get around. Litchfield is a hour out of Darwin but Adelaide River is worth a look as well, so a day trip would cover both. Bring your bathers, pack some water (about five litres for two people), grab some cheese and bacon rolls from Colesworth to snack on. Everywhere that requires a 4WD says so and a 2WD is absolutely fine for 90% or the park. Kakadu is three hours away from Darwin and parts of it are best in the morning so I‚Äôd suggest a tour and/or accommodation for that. Nitmiluk Gorge is three hours from Darwin and Jabiru and is worth visiting. Territory Wildlife Park and Berry Springs are a full-ish day and you‚Äôll be back in the city for dinner. Have a look at what‚Äôs available https://northernterritory.com/"
Reddit/darwin,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"I just spent 7 nights in the Top End - 1 in Darwin, 2 in Lifchfield, 2 in Katherine (for Nitmiluk and Mataranka/Bitter Springs) and 2 in Kakadu. For me, the highlights were in the national parks as opposed to any more time in Darwin, so you might feel the same if you like the outdoors. Hiring a car was excellent. Gives you so much flexibility and you can also avoid the peak times when all the tour groups roll in. We only had a 2WD and were able to access many places, except for some of the just opened 4WD only roads in Kakadu. You might be able to do Litchfield from Darwin, but I would definitely recommend staying in Kakadu and near Nitmiluk. Happy to share more from my experience if it will help."
Reddit/darwin,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"The 250km a day thing is annoying though over 7 days and a careful itinerary you will manage - Darwin to Litchfield to Mataranka to Ubirr to Darwin is around 1300km and 7 days gives you 1750 so plenty for detours. And you don't need to go all the way to Mataranka (though it is worth it). If Mataranka is too far, then I think you should still do Nitmiluk - it's a bit of a triangle between Darwin, Katherine and Jabiru so it makes sense. Edith Falls is worth a look, too. I have actually never done any of the Kakadu sites that need a 4WD but hear they are impressive - but you'll get a great taste with Cooinda, Nourlangie, Ubirr and if you are keen to see, say Jim Jim or Twin Falls you could check out a tour from Jabiru. That would likely be cheaper than a 4WD hire for the whole week. Another good option is a scenic flight over Kakadu. But a 2WD trip will be good."
Reddit/AskReddit,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Nitmiluk Gorge
Reddit/darwin,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Also if you want to do a magnificent hike, Nitmiluk is stunning or a lot of hikes around Jabiru to see rock art."
Reddit/australia,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"At Nitmiluk, rent a canoe for half a day, it's great, a little pricey but worth it IMO... I loved it so much I'm returning next week to do it again, lol (I'd avoid Tennant Creek, ok for cheap fuel but not a good place to spend a night, high crime and such)"
Reddit/australia,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"I love the outback too and never find it boring so can understand why you find it appealing. I haven't done the Nullabor yet (next year) but there seems to be heaps of things to see along the way. I would download Wikicamps (it's worth the price) to find campsites and points of interest. On the highways, it's easy enough and plenty of mobile phone service most of the time or enough traffic if you are in a spot without it you can flag for help but if you go off road I would recommend taking something like a Zoleo (don't necessarily need a sat phone). You can suspend the service when you no longer need it. You could probably do most of what you want without going offroad. As far as a route you could do Melbourne (haha I am biased as I live there so all my trips start there) to Twelve Apostles to Adelaide to Lake Hillier to Perth (Rottnest Island) to Broome to Nitmiluk to Darwin to Daintree then through Cairns on your way down to Brisbane to Three Sisters/Sydney then fly home from there. A rough plan on google shows this is about 136h of driving. This skips Uluru though it's more inner Australia and out of the way. You could always go to Uluru from Nitmiluk then to the Three Sisters across to Sydney and work your way up to Cairns and Daintree through Brisbane (another 46h driving then you have to figure out where to go to fly home after that if you didn't want to back track much, maybe fly to Brisbane and go home from there). Uluru adds a significant detour so it is awkward to fit it in tbh. I LOVED Uluru (particularly Kata Tjuta) though so definitely recommend it. It is not bleak and dangerous along the Stuart Highway to get there but I would avoid driving from dusk onwards as risk of animal strike is high (dingos, wedgetailed eagles, roos, cows, occasionally a camel makes an appearance as well). NT and outback SA have been my favourite trip places. If you do go through the inner part places I liked that aren't too hard or desolate are Palm Valley, Mereenie Loop, Kings Canyon (my favourite walk ever), Flinders Ranges, Coober Pedy (weirdest town ever), Birdsville Track, Ooodnadatta Track. I could write for hours on this topic but I will leave it there, feel free to ask any questions!"
Reddit/australia,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"I‚Äôve just done a 6 month lap. Melbourne-Eyre Penninsula- Nullarbor- Kalgoorlie- Esperance - Margaret River - Bunbury - Perth - Pinnacles a Kalbarri - Denmark/Monkey Mia - Coral Bay - Ningaloo - Exmouth - Karajini NP - 80 mile - Broome - Cape Leveque - Derby - Horizontal Falls - Gibb River Road - Kununurra- Lake Argyle - Katherine - Litchfield NP - Darwin - Three Ways - Mt Isa - Winton - Longreach - Rockhampton- QLD central coast - Coffs Harbour - Sydney - Melbourne. This is just a high level list of locations we went to. Three months isn‚Äôt long enough in my opinion. You will undoubtedly spend more time in your car then actually enjoying the trip. That‚Äôs not to say the drive isn‚Äôt fun, it‚Äôs just you won‚Äôt actually spend time with the people, taking the time to see things and experience a location for what it is rather than what people tell you it is. Antique shops and golf courses weren‚Äôt even on our radar and we still didn‚Äôt see everything we wanted to. Also, doing it alone will be dangerous considering the distances you will travel. My wife and I shared the driving and did just on 30,000km in 6 months. Some 10 hour days. Perhaps consider half a lap. Adelaide - Flinders Ranges - Coober Pedy - Red Centre- Three Ways - Litchfield NP - Darwin and then choose which way - left in WA or right into QLD. I have friends currently doing exactly this. They‚Äôve chosen WA as it is bloody mammoth and magnificent. And coming back through the middle. You might want to check out Facebook groups like Planning a Lap of Australia or The Gibb River Road, Kimberley and Pilbara region. As someone mentioned download WikiCamps. If you plan on camping in national parks get a parks pass for WA. You need to book 180 days out to get into some camp grounds in WA. There is literally nothing like the Ningaloo coast anywhere else in the world. You need to take your time here. Bring a snorkel. This country is massive mate. I‚Äôve done some big drives in the USA. Nevada and Utah in a big loop including the north rim and through four ways and all the amazing national parks. Also Seattle down to San Fran. It‚Äôs nothing like that. There are more than 300 million people spread across the US. We have 26 mill. Towns are small, you need to plan and you need to not rush. Hopefully this gives you a bit to go on. Good luck and safe travels."
Reddit/travel,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Thanks! We haven't been but had a break planned in Litchfield on the drive to Nitmiluk. Hopefully we should be able to see the termite mounds and one of the falls. We aren't allowed to take the van on unpaved roads so will have to wait for the next time for anything like that. Eventually we are thinking we'd go from Perth to Adelaide, going around the northern area and then through Alice Springs."
Reddit/darwin,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"I stayed at the cabins in Nitmiluk, they were decent"
Reddit/darwin,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"I'd stay at Knotties or the contour. And the southern rockhole at Nitmiluk is amazing, had some family visiting from interstate go there for a swim."
Reddit/australia,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Fraser needs a 4WD, all the tracks are deep, powdery sand. So might make more sense to do that as a tour. Nitmiluk has multi day walks aside from Jatbula that go up the gorge, with water tanks to fill up along the way. As someone else said, carrying a lot of water on trails like Jatbula is the main challenge as there will probably be no flowing water along the trails in July. If you are in that region you can easily do Kakadu, Litchfield and Nitmiluk in a week or two. If you're into longer walks, Litchfield doesn't have any, Kakadu has day walks up to 20km (Jim Jim, Yurmikmik and the Nourlangie Barrk walk)."

Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Originally called Ayers Rock.

Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There‚Äôs definitely going to be more flies at Uluru starting from September, with their numbers increasing as the weather gets hotter.

Carry a torch if you can, it‚Äôs too dark in the evenings."
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is not outright illegal to take a photo of Uluru, but there are important cultural and legal restrictions that limit where photos can be taken.

Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah, so that side of Uluru is basically private - the Anangu have their homes there because it's a side of Uluru few get to see and even fewer get to photograph. I've had the privilege of visiting them. And once I was there, I understood. I did sign a tonne of papers swearing no photos. It's their home, they have a right to privacy and to set boundaries. The main thing is ensuring any photos you do have are not public."
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Thank you for this link. It states that Ayers Rock Resort is owned by the government (ISLC) and not Anangu. The Yulara land was originally excluded from the handback to the Katiti Aboriginal Land Trust. After a long legal process (settled around 2006), Anangu recognised land trusts do not have freehold ownership of Yulara like they do for the park."
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I would not recommend the Sound of Silence dinner. We did this and it started out fine, but sadly the sky was cloudy and the ‚Äúsky-talker‚Äù couldn‚Äôt talk about anything relevant. The food was mediocre and as it was served buffet style in the open air, it was pretty much cold by the time our table was called up. It got dark and they put these little electric candles on every table (couldn‚Äôt see our food without them), but they attracted SO MANY FLYING INSECTS. It was kind of gross, they kept ending up on the plate. Overall, not a good experience. What we DID really enjoy was the bus tour to see the sunrise over Uluru, a beautiful sunrise hike at Kata Tjuta and a nice sunset viewing (we had a rental car and self-drove), and we rented bikes and rode all around the base of Uluru one morning. (It was really hot and we found this a bit more appealing than walking for 2+ hours in the sun. We took frequent breaks and loads of pictures.) We stayed at the Lost Camel and we really enjoyed having the pool - although there is limited shady seats/loungers. In case you‚Äôre not aware - everything is owned by one company - all the accommodation, campsite, shops, etc., as well as all the activities. So you can‚Äôt really shop around for a better deal or anything like that. We kind of wished we had done the Field of Light and if we ever go again we would choose that hands down over eating with the bugs out in the desert. üòâ"
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"(1) Unless nobody in your group has any idea of how to make a simple packed lunch, pre booking of things like picnics are a bit of a rort. (2) Whatever you do, set aside a full day and take your time to slowly and gently walk around Uluru to absorb the amazing tranquility and its unique ""spirit of place"" (for want of a better phrase). Once you're in the National Park, its free to walk around the entire circumference, and highly recommended if physically possible (its all flat pathways - no hills, no stairs). Every section, you'll discover something new and amazing. (On the other hand, if you're the sort of person that thinks a Segway would be a great way to experience the Taj Mahal, then book a Segway tour.) (3) Dont skip heading over to Kata Tjuta. Its just as amazing as Uluru."
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Almost all of the excursions are overpriced and wine focused. The drone and light shows, IMO, are more about manmade art where the magical desert is just the backdrop, of which you can't see anything because it's dark. It's a waste of time and money. You can do EVERYTHING by yourself. The hop on hop off bus is EXPENSIVE, better off renting 2 cars. Get the fly nets. Hike around Uluru base, it's about 7 miles. Hike at Kata Tjuta, it's magical. If you have a clear night, just drive out 10 minutes and you will have amazing skies, download the stars app on your phone. Grab cheap food at the IGA grocery store. Avoid the Kiosk restaurant. The Gecko restaurant is good and well priced. Camel excursion is the only one you can't do on your own."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru only got so big as it has no natural predators
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I went to Uluru 2 years ago and chose not to climb it. As our guide so wisely said, the rock is what you‚Äôve come to see, in the middle of nowhere. All there is to see from the top is the nothing that surrounds. Edit to clarify: - ‚Äúthe nothing‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúnothing‚Äù. It refers to the landscape you‚Äôve just spent 5~ hrs admiring on your trek out and will again on the way back. - there are joy flights if you‚Äôd like an aerial view that you can do without going against people‚Äôs wishes. - the rock is beautiful and explorable from the ground. There are caves, kitchens, paintings and stories to learn about. You can touch and explore the rock from here. If it‚Äôs culture you‚Äôre aiming for, this is where to be."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"10 years ago I probably would have been in that line but after travelling the world and experiencing different cultures I would never have climbed all over a sacred Buddhist temple, so why would I climb Uluru?"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Just imagine how long the queue is going to be when the traditional owners announce plans to outlaw punching yourself in the testicles at the base of Uluru
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I went to Uluru in 2009. My friends and I chose not to Climb it. We found some new friends to eat acid with and camped near by. Magical time. We saw a UFO that night. (it wasn't because of the acid...
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I‚Äôm conflicted on this issue, downvote me all you want. A few years or months ago I thought of the same thing many people think about Uluru, ‚Äúrespect the true owners of the land‚Äù and ‚Äúdisrespectful tourists‚Äù ect. However when I actually visited Uluru from Melbourne for a school excursion earlier this May my whole view changed completely. My tour guide was the best, wise and truthful person (I forgot his name) but anyways he told us that the whole deal of closing down climbing the rock and the signs that say not to were all done by the media to manipulate and misconstrue us, play a narrative that white Australians think they‚Äôre doing the right thing by doing useless things such as closing down Uluru for no reason. He told us the real reason why Indigenous Australians are upset is that Uluru itself is a rock and has no sacred value. What does are certain parts and areas where traditions have been held (such as child birth) they were called ‚Äòsensitive sites‚Äô and were asked not to take photos. The issue is when tourist disrespect these wishes and not respect the area. Our tour guide actually encouraged us to get on the rock (not climb) our teachers were taken back because they were aware beforehand of the situation. The tour guide did tell us it was a good thing they were banning closing it down because of deaths due to the lack of safety and you get the same view of the place on the ground. The trip really opened my eyes and as I said before, I‚Äôm conflicted. You may not believe me but I encourage you if you‚Äôre an Australian to make the trip to Uluru once in your life. Tdlr: Went to Uluru and found out media manipulates us when Indigenous Australians didn‚Äôt actually care that much about the ban. Edit: I didn‚Äôt climb Uluru out of respect of the Indigenous Australians and Uluru look way better from a distance anyway."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a shame, really loved climbing Ayers rock many years ago. It's a rock, no one owns it. Good on them."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What is the significance of Uluru?
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,i wonder what visiting Uluru as a traveller would have been like in the times of the first nation... to hear the stories and see it in the setting sun... I think that would have been pretty special.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The aboriginal elders of our land asked us to stop climbing Uluru out of respect and this is what they got. Is it just me or is this pretty distasteful.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I thought you weren‚Äôt allowed to climb the Uluru as it is the Aboriginal people‚Äôs property and because it is against their religion and folklore.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,These people: [Fuck yo ~~couch~~Uluru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcJkhSUSnek)
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Climbed it in the 90s when it was still Ayers Rock (sp?l
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Confession. This is not a ‚Äòfriend‚Äôs ‚Äô footage. This is my footage. I climbed Uluru on Sunday. I wanted to spark discussion and hear other‚Äôs P.O.V without the personal attacks clouding how I might receive it. I‚Äôve climbed to Machu Picchu, Everest Base Camp, St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, the Vatican Dome, The Great Wall of China, The Great Pyramid of Giza (well... as high as I was allowed to go), The Grand Canyon, Santorini and The Burj Khalifa...I could go on... But for me, as an Australian, I can honestly say climbing Uluru topped them all. Seeing the harsh, red desert as far as the eye can see... the serenity, the remoteness.... the very centre of my country and culture to which I was born.... Most pertinent however was comprehending/reflecting on my insignificance; my short, fragile, mortal life contrasted with the (seemingly) immortal, immutable strength of Uluru.... It was almost a spiritual experience for me (climbing Uluru)... though I recognise irony/hypocrisy in what I‚Äôm about to say, this experience grew my respect and understanding for our indigenous forefathers, who, for 60,000+ years have been stewards of our great land. Caring for it, a part of it... understanding their place in nature, their fragility, their responsibility. As a (third generation) Australian, I too am a part of that responsibility (stewardship)... irrespective of the colour my skin (like that should count for anything!) or even historic ancestry! I knew just simply waking around it, or taking a helicopter flight would not evoke the same introspection. I needed to climb it. So, as soon as I heard it was closing, like many others, I booked my flight. I know many will not agree with my subjective, nuanced reasoning to climb... I have (and will be) judged as ‚Äòa selfish shitcunt‚Äô, ‚Äòa deplorable dick head‚Äô or an ‚Äòarrogant asshole‚Äô. ... But i think the controversy of the Uluru climb is actually an (inappropriate) proxy/scapegoat for the bigger issue in Australia: respecting indigenous culture and making amends for historic injustice and cultural genocide committed at the hands of colonisers... I don‚Äôt think banning the climb is the solution here. I will respect the wishes of the Anangu and never climb again, but I‚Äôm glad I took the opportunity while it was still legal and allowed. I hope one day the Anangu will decide to guide (the Uluru climb) those who are wanting to learn from Aboriginal culture, so that one day my children can experience the significance of Uluru. Furthermore, I hope that one day all Australians will reach a point of reconciliation and integration with indigenous culture that the colour of our skin or the tally of our Australian ancestors does not determine our ownership/responsibility for our land... but that we are collectively responsible and equally accountable for our Great South Land. No TLDR - if you want to understand my (subjective) perspective... you need all of it ;)"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Took [this photo](http://imgur.com/a/u5zPAOo) earlier this year when some dickhead decided to climb even though it was shut down for the day. The Park Ranger gave him a serving and reported him to the police right in front of us. Then he took us on a free tour around Uluru. Was a pretty sweet day all round.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Fuck me dead just get an aerial shot from up there from Wikipedia or some shit and leave it alone. Christ these people... Edit: aww yeah nah let's all just pile on then, fuck Uluru... nevermind me... or Uluru..."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"In the last couple of years at least, most of the official Uluru tourism brochures are about sunset and sunrises, loop walk, Aboriginal culture and just enjoying the magnificence of the rock from different angles/viewing platforms. This will take time to trickle down to overseas visitors, but once it does I reckon most of the tourism numbers will be back to normal after the climbing closure."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayers Rock*
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There will likely only be a fraction of a percent of the people that have been climbing it in recent years, attempting to climb it in the future, so I doubt it would be too hard to police. I also doubt it would carry a crazy punishment. It's mainly out of respect (or so they say) to the Anangu people that the ban is being brought in. So all of these people who are queueing just to say ""I climbed Uluru"", will possibly be belittled in the distant future for being assholes üòÖ . It may also be likely to the cost of rescuing tourists from it, and possibly even the cost of claims brought against them by the same tourists. That cost should be eliminated with a ban."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I‚Äôve not climbed it and have no intention to, but of all the arguments against it this is one of the strangest. A house that overlooks the sea provides a view of nothing yet many clamour for such properties. There is beauty to behold in the starkness of Uluru‚Äôs surroundings. Subjective no doubt, but you cannot deny its existence."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A Buddhist temple is a man made shrine to a belief. Uluru is just a rock that beliefs were attached to. It existed long before people and will exist long after. People like to climb rocks.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One is built, the other is a found object? This is my sticking point with the argument about ""you wouldn't climb St Pauls"" I tend to believe the multi generational effort to make something is worthy of respect. To pretend a found object should be revered on the same level, is saying that that effort had no meaning. I disagree. Also your not going to damage Uluru. Unless you're a total dick. Accidentally damaging St Pauls is conceivable at least. I'm not advocating climbing it but pretending they are the same is patently untrue."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I agree that we‚Äôve failed miserably at respecting the traditional owners of Australia, but I perceived that line to be mostly foreign tourists. Regardless, we can‚Äôt change the past and I‚Äôm grateful that Uluru is being returned now. I hope it is the first of many initiatives in our attempt to make amends for the past."

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Will always be Ayers Rock in my eyes. Not sure why you're getting downvoted it's still an official name for the place.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The airport and town are called Ayers Rock. The rock is officially called Uluru
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Having climbed the rock I can tell you he's right, there's fuck all to look at from the top. If you go all the way to Uluru you'll already be well acquainted with the nothingness that surrounds it. There's no real benefit in seeing that same nothingness from a slightly elevated position."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"**Arguement: the owners and operators said no** error! error! does not compute **Arguement:** I can climb St Paul's cathedral why not Ayers Rock? Judge, the reason why I fucked her is because I received permission to fuck some other girl after payment that is why i'm not guilty of rape **Arguement:** A S T H E T I C S Oh thank god, for a minute there I thought I had to listen to Aboriginals and recognise Anangu ownership and management as well as their deal with Hawke on a 99 year lease to the National Parks and Wildlife agency with joint management on the condition that people wouldn't climb Uluru."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You can see the same sort of landscape anywhere around the area, this is nothing that's special to the National Park. The main reason you're going to Uluru is to see Uluru. If you want rugged landscapes you don't need to make it all the way out there. This is the argument."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Can confirm. Top of the Rock (as in Rockefeller Plaza, not Uluru) at sunset gives you an *amazing* photo op."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Great tip. What's the equivalent lookout tower next to Uluru called? I can't find it on Google maps.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru isn‚Äôt granite and No.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">your [sic] not going to damage Uluru. Maybe a single person isn't, but tens of thousands of people year on year sure are."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I mean, no individual person will do damage but people climbing Uluru over and over again over the years *does* degrade it and alter it. And to be honest, I‚Äôm happy to acknowledge that the people who looked after the site for tens of thousands of years before ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äù existed have slightly more claim to it than anyone else."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">Have some respect. The name change to Uluru/Ayers Rock was requested by the NT tourism organisation to make it more marketable. It has nothing to do with ""showing respect"". Paddy Uluru, its original traditional Aboriginal custodian didn't care what people called it, nor was he against [people climbing it.](https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/australia/theyre-welcome-to-it-custodian-of-uluru-had-no-problem-with-tourists-climbing-the-rock-and-aborigines-were-scaling-the-monolith-in-the-1940s/ar-AAEcxax) But apparently climbing it nowadays is offensive to the traditional owners lol."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No, but they pay to get into the national park that it is contained within. If people can‚Äôt climb Uluru the question becomes ‚Äòwho will still go?‚Äô It‚Äôs a spectacular sight up close and personal, I think there might be a slight drop in revenue but not much."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We can have all the things you've mentioned and not climb Uluru. It's kind of ridiculous that I even need to say that.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes. I did this - as well as the cultural centre. I had a guide who helped my understand the sacred site. I recommend doing these first. It was the climb that first drew me to Uluru, but it was the base walk and the culture centre where I learned the most - the climb allowed me to process and consolidate what I‚Äôd learned; allowed it to became significant for me."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Not sure either hey, as I said in my other comment, as a kid we were actually told that Uluru is the Aboriginal name and we shouldn't butcher it with our mispronunciation and cultural appropriation."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The rock is also called Ayers Rock, the town isn't a rock, the Airport isn't a rock, the rock is a Rock. >On 19 July 1873, the surveyor William Gosse sighted the landmark and named it Ayers Rock in honour of the then Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers. I mean, I know you can use either name, but as a kid growing up, we were told if we weren't Aboriginal, it could be considered offensive and a form of cultural appropriation to use their religiously significant term for the formation. Plus the local people pronounce it entirely differently to how most of us pronounced it."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It was pretty cool to see Kata Tjuta in the distance in that short clip.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I‚Äôve climbed it and the view from the top was *spectacular*. It was early morning, and the sun was rising behind us. The shadow of the rock stretched out across the desert like this long, thin, dark needle for miles. In the distance the sun was catching on the Olgas/Kata Tjuta and they looked like opals. It was a once in a lifetime sight, and regardless of the ethics of climbing the rock, I‚Äôm glad I got to see it."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Someone voted you down. Possibly because they think Top of the Rock is a reference to Uluru. I gave you back an upvote.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">Performing mental gymnastics to justify that decision, such as comparing climbing the rock to a building, is highly misleading. However, there are no such mental gymnastics in my argument. My argument is simply about ownership - it's ""their stuff"" and ""they don't want you climbing on it"", whether ""they"" is the Anangu, the Catholics, or your neighbour, and whether ""it"" is Uluru, St Mary's, or a shed. It doesn't matter *why* ""they"" don't want you climbing it. &#x200B; >whereas people climb hills and mountains all the time On public property. People don't go climbing hills and mountains on farms without the permission of the owners. People also go camping all the time, but that doesn't mean that you have the moral right to pitch a tent in a stranger's suburban backyard. Is 'not camping in a backyard' a political right? Of course. Private property itself is political. There is nothing in the physical world that reflects that person X owns area of land Y. The concept of 'ownership' itself is political. It's all down to what a government (a political construct) stores in it's records (another political construct) about ownership (a third political construct)."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was talking specifically about the handback of Uluru, which happened in 1985."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well, you can actually go inside Kata Tjuta, which in my opinion is way more amazing. There are also other canyons in the area with incredible rock formations and steep cliffs."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Given the Australian government approved projects that would pollute and degrade the other world wonder we have, we definitely have committed ""crimes against humanity"" (though seriously, you're equating genocide with letting Indigenous people manage the land they've been on for thousands of years?). It's the Indigenous people who protect natural wonders like this, and argue against projects that degrade the environment. And your argument doesn't work because governments own the land where heaps of other culturally significant places are. Like the Colosseum, Stonehenge, every National Park in the US. Every piece of land is owned by somebody. The Indigenous people of Australia aren't just a people, they're a government too. So if you respect the rules when you go to a National Park, or when you go to the Empire State Building, or Notre Dame, or the memorial at Ground Zero, then you're going places governments own (and can destroy at any time), so you owe Uluru the same respect."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Pushing organised religion is frowned upon because they‚Äôre historically powerful institutions, and proselytising is a method of expanding their power and influence. This is not a power thing, it is a genuine spiritual and cultural thing. Indigenous peoples are not trying to recruit. Those who are asking people not to climb Uluru are asking them to respect something sacred."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> In my opinion, for many walking over the Rock is a symbolic way of saying 'fuck you' to the concept of recognising Aboriginal custodianship... of anything. This is my beef with the ""but why should we care about their religion?"" argument. It's less about religion and more about showing respect in general. When you ignore requests not to climb Uluru, you're not just flipping off ""beliefs"", you're flipping off a specific group of people sociopolitically."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So what if their beliefs are you shouldn't live in a house because you can't see the stars You have your beliefs I'll have mine The last post is not a valid analogy, it relates to a minute of time and keeping your mouth shut is not impacting you. If you don't want to be there for it, you don't have to be. If I want to see the desert surrounding Uluru / Ayres rock then that is how to do it. If I want a physical challenge then that is how to do it Pushing your beliefs on others is what's happening. Say your piece about why you think it's wrong but don't crucify those who ignore you."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Because the cultural heritage of people that live there is of more importance than the ability to say ""I climbed Uluru"" and then forget about it upon returning home."

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Went in 2013, Uluru was nice (didn't climb, instead hiked the whole way round), but Kata Tjuta was truly fantastic."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Im not an advocate for climbing Uluru or anything, but what you just wrote could be applied to all mountaineering. People like climbing things for various reasons."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru isn't a sacred site because it's big. It's a sacred site because it has watering holes (so water and food) plus shelter. Thousands of other rocks fit that description and were routinely visited and decorated by Indigenous Australians, yet only two are offensive to climb. Mt Connor is also big (859 metres above sea level vs 863 for Uluru) and is located nearby. However, without providing water there was no reason for the local Indigenous population to visit, thus is not sacred. Also, without modern geographic methods, there would have been no way for the local Indigenous population to determine if Mt Connor or Uluru was taller. So the idea that Uluru is special because it's the tallest rock isn't accurate."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">It is offensive and controversial to climb any sacred site. But yet I've been to 50+ sacred sites and only two of them requested that you don't climb them (Uluru and Kata Tjuta). Now that I think of it, they were the only two that were offensive to photograph as well. A few others requested no flash photography, but that was for preservation purposes, not because it offended religious sensibilities."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There's publicized fines for doing those things, but seemingly nothing written about uluru...This is what I'm saying and nobody is linking to a penalty or anything about how it will be enforced."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah, and that's why mountain climbers - particular professional ones, tend to display respect for places that have a cultural meaning to them, such as Mount Everest. So I feel it really isn't that hard to field some basic cultural awareness and understand why climbing Uluru is a completely dick move against the aboriginal Anangu."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"None so large as Uluru and surrounded by vast desert. That's part of its attraction, to my western eyes anyway. I've been to Wave rock, to Kakadu, to Uluru, Geike Gorge, Karijini, Milstream, Lichfield, etc etc. Each have their own awe factor. Uluru is i*n sui genris,* to borrow a legal term, which means it stands alone."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Climbing it is entering it, because its high. If it was wide it wouldn't be a climbing ban it would be an entering ban, like there is an entering ban on one side of Uluru that no-one seems to take issue with. Same as there are areas of Nourlangie rock in Kakadu where tourists are banned, yet other areas that they can enter; and they can climb Ubirr rock."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Enforcement is an interesting question. I‚Äôm not from the Northern Territory but work in a related field in a different state. It‚Äôll be protected under the applicable heritage legislation. So at a state level, that would be the Heritage Act 2011 (iirc). Once the climbing ban is enacted, people could possibly face penalties for not complying with the site protections. So IF the site registration, management plan and resulting protections specifically disallow climbing (or access) in the future, it is a prosecutable offence. I think some of those penalties can involve jail time, if successfully prosecuted to that level. Part 5.5 of the Heritage Act 2011 that outlines the specifics. I know that Uluru is UNESCO World Heritage Listed, so there‚Äôs commonwealth regulation / management under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (iirc). But I think that legislation is more intended to establish the management / protection framework than provide grounds for enforcement - that‚Äôs administratively better done at a state level. Also Uluru is held by the Anangu people in native title. (and maybe other property rights, Northern Territory native title / land rights are not my area of expertise). There is a 99 year lease in place to the Government, which allows the National Park to be managed under statute - which is important from a visitor control and management perspective. The National Park Board of management can likely take enforcement action against visitors who attempt to climb Uluru after the ban. Might be in the same way that littering and other infractions against the rules of visiting the park are managed - fines and such. These are generally enabled through the legislation and regulations that apply to managing the National Park, which differs state to state. I personally believe that they‚Äôre starting off softly, and hoping visitors will do the right thing. If the climbing ban isn‚Äôt respected, the management body and the State Government will likely have to look at enforcement mechanisms and decide how to best apply what is available (such as via my above vague description of options)."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I assume Uluru is a Commonwealth reserve? If so it might be enforced through [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2018C00929); specifically section 12.55 If you walked past a sign that prohibits entry you could be fined 30 penalty units.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">None so large as Uluru and surrounded by vast desert. Mt Connor (which is right next to it) is literally 4 metres shorter (859 vs 863). It's not sacred or was visited by the traditional owners because there's no water, thus remains on private property."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The rocks formerly known as the Olgas have been Kata Tjuta for a long time now.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,They seem to have been able to govern themselves quite happily for thousands of years before Europeans came here and told them they were doing it wrong. And in this case I‚Äôm not talking about a pan-Australian body. Uluru sits on Anangu land and so Anangu laws apply. What the rest of Aboriginal Australia says about it isn‚Äôt really relevant.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"In 2018 [three people were charged](https://www.cdpp.gov.au/case-reports/martin-brook-lee-kringsberg-and-matthew-skelton-environmental-safety) with offences under section 12.55 for straying off the path at Uluru. So, it seems reasonable to assume this is one avenue for enforcement."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You fly direct to Uluru. Do a tour, stay at Yulara resort, fly out."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Fly to Ayers Rock Airport, not Alice Springs. It's a long, dull drive from Alice. Stay at Yulara, it's nice enough. Nothing is cheap in the Territory. Ignore people who say don't go because you can't climb it: I climbed it in the 70s and you're not missing much at all. The walk around the base is spectacular (as long as it's not too hot). We returned several times to see the rock and surrounds at different times of the day and felt very welcome."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"7 days at Uluru would be a long time. Average is I think 3 nights that people stay. No Airbnb in the area so you will have to staybat the resort. You can do it without having a rental vehicle, but you would need to jump on organised tours as Yulara is not right there at the rock. Recommend if adding Kings Canyon, then do it as a tour in one day (lots of driving otherwise) otherwise stay at least 1 night at Kings Canyon."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We stayed in the local caravan park (had a camper trailer). We drove up from Adelaide, so also spent time in Coober pedy and Alice Springs. There is so much to do around there like the McDonald ranges and, kings canyon. We stayed for 3 nights in Yulara, watched the sunset at Uluru, ride our bikes around it, field of lights etc"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You can fly to Uluru and stay at Yulara. Forget about driving from Alice, it's a time waster."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,YOu can go straight to Uluru. Do a tour from wherever you are. You don't need to go to Alice Springs. Be aware that it's all very expensive. 2 or 3 days is ample time out there.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,2 - 3 nights is all u [need.As](http://need.As) others say fly direct to Uluru and stay at the resort. There are a number of price options. Uluru is great but Kata Tjuta is probably my favourite of the two... esp for walking. We rented a car at Uluru airport - but you must book ahead. Really popular and even with a rental booking there can be long queues
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Mate uluru is definitely not dangerous lol, I lived in Alice and thats not even dangerous if youre not looking for trouble, its probably one of the most expensive places youll experience and made up like a resort town. The drive from Alice is 5-6 hours which isnt that long but Ive done so much driving in my life I just hate it and flights into Alice can be pretty pricey so yeah you could fly straight there"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Flew to Ayers Rock Airport. Rented a car for 3 days for an obscene amount. Stayed at a hotel in that touristy town (Yullara?) The rock looks good but I wouldn‚Äôt do it again. Cheaper and easier to fly overseas
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Fly into Ayers Rock Airport, much closer to the rock than Alice Springs"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I recommend you fly to Alice Springs, rather than to Yulara-Ayers Rock (AYQ). There are so many scenic and interesting places to experience, that flying to the Centre just for Uluru seems such a sub-optimal choice. There are 3-4 wonderful drives from Alice - day-trips. The drive to Yulara is long, but we love it, and have done some or all of it many times. Kings Canyon should not be missed. For almost all the things that most tourists will do, Alice Springs isn't dangerous. We have old friends living there, and they advise that it's not the same charming place it was 30-40 years ago, but they're not trembling in their beds each night."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We drove from SA to Uluru, but depends on where you‚Äôre coming from and how much time you have. There is also an airport at Uluru, so you can fly there."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Doing it as a long weekend later in the year. Day 1 - fly into Ayers Rock, shuttle bus to Ayers Rock Resort. Day 2 - tourist bus to the Rock, hire bikes to ride around it, back to resort. Day 3 - late breakfast, fly home! I‚Äôve been told by a few people who have been there that this is plenty of time!"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You can walk around the base. Kaya Kjuta is also worth seeing, as is Kings Canyon if you drive from Alice and don't fly direct to Uluru"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Drive if you have time and a good car. Stay at Ayers Rock Lodge. Avoid Alice Springs. The walk up the middle of Katajuta is good.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I've been there twice. Flights arrive mid afternoon. Shuffle these key activities around according to weather conditions at the time. * Day 1: arrive, collect rental car, hike Kata Tjuta (late option) * Day 2: morning: Uluru Segway Tour; evening: Field of Light & Wintjiri Wiru * Day 3: Uluru sunrise, Uluru Cultural Centre, hike Kata Tjuta (daytime option), Uluru sunset * Day 4: return rental car for morning departure"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There‚Äôs a a variety of classes of accommodation at the resort, including camping. 3 days is enough Uluru, Kata-Tjuta and Kings Canyon."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,No point going to Ayers Rock cos the aborigines won't let you near it.
Reddit/EarthPorn,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One cool thing about Uluru is that, even though it‚Äôs in the middle of a desert, it has [a lot of trees and vegetation growing all around it](https://www.lovethesepics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Aerial-view-of-Uluru-aka-Ayres-Rock.jpg). This is because, when it does rain, all the water runs off the giant rock and gets concentrated around its perimeter."
Reddit/EarthPorn,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I thought you aren‚Äôt supposed to take pictures of Uluru, or is it just specific spots?"
Reddit/EarthPorn,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I visited Uluru years ago. So many people lined up to climb it. A friend of mine recommended I walk around it. I walked a portion of it. So happy I did. You get to see so much more in terms of detail and colour...and the walk is peaceful.
Reddit/EarthPorn,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I love the name Uluru. I get the compulsive urge to repeat it under my breath when I see it written. Weirdly, I dreamed of this place before I ever saw a picture of it, walking along it's ridge (a no-no in reality), when I did see a pic, my Aussie mate said ""Yeah, it's from the Dream Time"", and I just about flipped over backwards..."
Reddit/EarthPorn,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow, that's just stunning! There must be zillions of fantastic but identical photos of Uluru out there, but this is really unique."
Reddit/EarthPorn,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For a moment I thought it was another firestorm or some sort of crazy lava wall, but then I realised that it's Uluru itself. (or ""Ayers Rock"" as I heard it called growing up)"
Reddit/EarthPorn,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I love this perspective of Uluru. Most often one sees photos taken from a distance, maybe an attempt to capture its massiveness? I enjoy this photo for the texture it show in the rock in contrast to the trees. The rock looks like flowing lava."
Reddit/EarthPorn,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Not OP, but was at Uluru last year. There are specific spots where you're not allowed to take photos - plenty of signs instructing you not to and your guide will tell you as well. But otherwise, photos are perfectly okay."
Reddit/EarthPorn,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I get what you mean, but those are manmade objects, uluru is a natural formation that's existed for millions of years. No one truly owns it, since it exists outside of humanity. Aboriginal and european culture has been around for a blink of an eye compared to the age of uluru. Any thing else I understand but seriously it's 600 million years old."
Reddit/DeltaForceGlobal,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Where did you get killed? I killed that guy at the major sub dorm with uluru‚Äôs fire
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It can be busy but it‚Äôs still nice. IMO other places nearby like Kata Tjuta and kings canyon are actually a little more exciting because you can explore around a lot more, as well as being less busy. It can be very cold in central Australia in June, bring warm clothes!"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I don‚Äôt know about Uluru specifically, but in general if you want to drive around in Australia be prepared for how far away everything is I‚Äôve heard it said that there are places in the Outback where the closest people are in the ISS (if it‚Äôs directly overhead)"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Where are you flying to? Even Alice Springs is 5 hours to Uluru. Kings canyon is another 4 hours and the Olga's are 40 minutes from Uluru but a 3 hour walk to get there. As far as tourists go, there's plenty, but it's a big place. Unless you're sitting in the carpark you will easily be able to get away from the crowds. There's a 10km walk that takes you right around the base."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When you say hiring a car and visiting Uluru, do you realise it‚Äôs 450kms or about five and a half hours drive from Alice Springs? But that‚Äôs the easy bit. Alice Springs is 1500kms from Darwin or 1530kms from Adelaide. If you aren‚Äôt used to long drives then it‚Äôs much better as a shared journey so your passenger can help you stay alert etc. you also need to take lots and lots of water and food as well as ideally several spare tires. Being stranded out there can be life and death‚Ä¶ most people who drive to Ulu·πüu are experienced off roaders or they fly to Alice Springs and hire a car from there."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is more crowded in the dry season (May to October) because it's much nicer to visit then, but it's not crowded like the Louvre or Times Square. There's plenty of room to spread out and avoid the tour groups if that's what you'd like. The weather is cooler in the dry and there are less flies, so it's more popular with tourists. They don't bite, they're just annoying. Most tourists just buy a face net for a few dollars from the supermarket. It can also be very cold in June, overnight and first thing in the morning, so make sure you have layers."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'm not a huge fan of organised tours, but I did one to Uluru and Kata Tjuta from Alice and it was really worth it. I could just enjoy the scenery and relax and not have to drive 5 hours one way. We slept in swags by a fire (but you could choose bougier accommodation too) and the whole experience was great - wasn't rushed either. Do your research and find a good group - will end up being cheaper and more enjoyable in the long run, especially if you're inexperienced with multi hour drives each way in the desert."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is BIG. if you do the base walk even when it is busy you will be by yourself most of the time. A bit of insect repellent will keep away most flies.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I suppose you could rent a car at the Uluru airport, but you'd have to check. There is the rock itself and Kata Tju·πØa. I would personally take any indigenous tours on offer as you're likely to get a much deeper appreciation of the area. When I was there many years ago there weren't any, but I believe that's changed. It can get very cold at dawn until the sun hits."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru has more tourists than Antarctica... but it's about as close as you can get without freezing to death. Although it does get pretty bloody cold at night in winter. Definitely go in winter, because while temperatures can drop below freezing at night it's still likely to be hot during the day. You do not want to be there in mid summer. You don't even want to be there five months before/after mid summer. There will be a few tourists at the rock itself, but not many. And drive 30 minutes away and you'll be on your own with only dingoes to keep you company (they're pretty shy - we only ever saw footprints throughout our campsite each morning). Protect your food and rubbish like you would in bear country and you'll be fine. You will want to hire (or buy) your own car to avoid crowds - obviously if you take a tour bus to Uluru there will be a busload of tourists wherever you go. Flies are annoying but they don't bite - mostly they're just desperate to find water and will drink the water directly out of your eyes if that's the only water they can find. They are very sensitive to temperature and the temperature will vary massively from one hour to the next, so it won't be all day. Just certain times of they day. You can buy a mesh flyscreen that goes over your hat and covers your head. Definitely buy those, I only wore mine for about 30 minutes a day but it was life saver during those 30 minutes. Uluru is definitely the stunning thing in the area but there are countless other almost as amazing things within a couple days drive and it's worth spending a month or two in the area if you can afford to take your time. The other attractions are less well known and often you can drive an entire hour on a major highway without seeing another human. Cell phone coverage is non-existent. Make sure you have lots of water (enough for days) and a [Personal Locator Beacon](https://beacons.amsa.gov.au/about/beacon-types.asp) because a broken down car or unexpected rain can be a life threatening emergency in that part of the world. Your travel insurance will pay for it if they [send a helicopter](https://www.lifeflight.org.au/record-rescue-year-for-mt-isa-lifeflight-chopper-crew/) to save your life. The ""royal flying doctor service"" was founded in that part of the world and with a PLB you will be protected by the best air rescue system in the world. They rescued 7,349 people last year - an average of 20 per day in a thinly populated part of the world. It's a very real threat, so take it seriously. Even Bear Grylls cannot survive out there on foot. They dropped him off somewhere much safer for his Australian Man vs Wild episode. All in all, it's one of the most special places I've been in my life and I can't wait to go back. The touristy guided walk around Uluru is absolutely worth it, you'll hear stories about how people lived there a hundred years ago. Pretty amazing stuff, given how hard it is to survive. It rains about 5 days a year out there half the time it rains even less."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The carparks, tourist info centre and toilets are where u will see most crowds but its not like visiting Europe in summer or bus loads of tourists all in the same place, Uluru is a big place, u will get plenty of time by youself"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It‚Äôs pretty great. The ‚Äútouristy‚Äù aspect is in the accomodation and food. You pretty much are stuck staying in the resort. But there are varying tiers of accomodation, with some parts a little cheaper than others. Their restaurants are generally disappointing. But there is a grocery store with the basics. I did a trip like yours a couple years ago. Loved so much about it. I was very glad I rented a car. Uluru is fantastic. I liked Kata Tju·πØan even more. There is a viewpoint there that is amazingly serene. I did a sunrise tour of Ulu·πüu and Kata Tjuta one morning. The guide was excellent in explaining the amazing geological processes needed to create both structures. Otherwise, I was happy to explore on my own. In June, prepare for it to get near freezing at night."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It looks exactly like the postcard, but with flies. Just buy a postcard of Uluru and a hat with a veil. Stand in a hot dry place wearing the hat and squint at the postcard. That's it, you just saved yourself 4 days of driving. Job done. It's a big rock literally in the middle of nowhere. There's not a lot of exploring to do. The Olga's just down the road were more interesting, I thought. But again, just some rocks in a desert. Took maybe an hour to completely exhaust the exploration possibilities there. I'm not saying don't do it. Just that you should probably lower your expectations. No, a bit lower. Yeah keep going. Little lower. There you go. Driving two days through barren wilderness to see a rock. Exactly as interesting as it sounds."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There's literally no reason to go to Uluru except to be a tourist. It's the outback, there are flies."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is literally a big resort, avoiding crowds is close to impossible lol Next stop Kings canyon is few hours away, few more for Alice Springs. In-between all that is desert with no reception."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru itself is an amazing experience and I definitely recommend going to see it. It's a very special place and make sure you read all the signs telling all the traditional Aboriginal stories of the area to get a full appreciation. Staying at Uluru though is a bit of a pain. There's a ""town"" nearby that's essentially just a collection of accommodation options all owned by the same company and a smattering of food options. It's all tourists and it's pretty pricey for just about everything, but unfortunately it's the only place you can stay. Doesn't override the positive of seeing Uluru though"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I went to Uluru on a small bus tour and it was great. Much better to be in a small tour group due to the extreme nature of the environment. It was spectacular - highly recommend.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Kata Tjuta i enjoyed more than uluru tbh
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,As long as he's flying straight to Uluru airport and staying at the resort the drives are all short.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"OP, how old are you? There are loads of tours that go from Yulara. I did one that covered Uluru, Kata Tju·πØa, and Kings Canyon over three days. It was great to have someone do the driving, organise all the food, and have set times for everything (eg sunrise and sunset at Uluru, sunrise at Kings Canyon) - and getting up at 4:30am was a lot easier in a group! However the one I did was swag camping to keep costs down and mostly people under 30, it was also pretty active. I‚Äôm sure there are tours with older crowds/proper accommodation, though they will be more expensive as everything round there is extortionate - but you‚Äôll be paying a lot for Yulara accommodation, food, car hire and fuel anyway. There‚Äôs some great stuff out there but don‚Äôt underestimate the distances. And definitely bring a fly net! The flies don‚Äôt bite but you really can‚Äôt understand how annoying they are until you have thirty flies flying at your face constantly and getting into your eyes, nose and mouth."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,There's always Ayers Rock airport(AYC) .....
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Would fly directly to the airport near uluru
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You can fly direct to Ayers Rock Airport from Sydney and Melbourne
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"OP don't listen to this person. They obviously have zero idea. Tourism around there is still at peak levels. As far as your question goes, it is such a huge area, you really don't notice too many other people. I would be concerned about you driving long distances though. 1 group of tourists just got found after a week in the bush, they were very lucky not to have died. There is so much that can go wrong out there, so I would suggest not driving, as you can just catch a flight right to Uluru. Our flies don't really bite..... Unless they are horse flies, which can take a little chunk out of you. If you aren't use to flies, they will drive you crazy. The trick is to just embrace them...... Waving them away becomes second nature, eventually. Have fun, and stay safe!"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Don't fly. There are other things worth stopping for on the drive to Uluru. Kings Canyon, Serpentine Gorge, Finke ""River"" (dry river bed for a lot of it), Simpson Desert, etc. Those are a few hours drive apart and well worth spending at least a day, maybe more than a week at each one... and that's just within a day's drive of Uluru. There's more stuff worth visiting further out. Bring plenty of water, a PLB, and common sense, you'll be perfectly safe."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Didn't read my other comment? Just picking and choosing so you can have a go at someone? Must be fun at parties. ""Where are you flying to? Even Alice Springs is 5 hours to Uluru. Kings canyon is another 4 hours and the Olga's are 40 minutes from Uluru but a 3 hour walk to get there."""
Reddit/DeltaForceGlobal,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I can‚Äôt wait till you have to play against a competent double uluru team. There‚Äôs nothing you can do against essentially impact grenades but just guess where they are going to throw it.
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Honestly Uluru is not the cheapest place to visit (or even to live in for the locals). AAT Kings are probably the main tour company up there (or the largest at least). If you are booking accommodation/campsite it goes through ayers rock resort and the website says its complimentary with accommodation. They meet all flights. There is a hop on hop off bus that runs. It looks like you can book multi day passes if you want to self guide. Remember that you will want to be going out morning and late afternoon though, the middle of the day will be hot and generally unpleasant. Kata Tjuta will shut for tours/hikes if the temperature hits a certain level by like 10 or 11am as it is not safe."
Reddit/RareHistoricalPhotos,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The clothes in the dingo den were found because a British tourist fell off of Uluru (known as Ayer‚Äôs Rock long ago) and landed near the dingo den several years after Azaria was snatched, while her mother languished in prison. They found the den and ultimately Baby Azaria‚Äôs clothes when retrieving the tourist‚Äôs body. The whole ‚ÄúA dingo took my baby!‚Äù event was very revealing and unfortunate. It showed the vicious mentality of the general public and the media. Baby Azaria‚Äôs mother was convicted in the court of public opinion long before she was convicted in a court of law, with significant help from the media and law enforcement. As for evidence against the Chamberlains, a chemical that shows blood lit up under the front dash of the car they took to Uluru, but later (AFTER Lindy Chamberlain was convicted) it was revealed that the chemical also lit up for the insulation/sealing product that the car manufacturer sprayed along the body of the car, including under the dash‚Ä¶ But at the time, nobody (except _some_ Aborigines) believed that a dingo would or could steal a human baby and successfully run off with it. Yet in the years after this happened, there have been a few concrete cases showing very clearly that YES, dingos absolutely CAN, and if desperate/hungry enough, might try to steal a human baby or a toddler. In one such case, a father had to (successfully) fight off a dingo who was dragging his toddler away‚Ä¶ The movie ‚ÄúA Cry in the Dark‚Äù (titled ‚ÄúEvil Angels‚Äù in Australia) with Meryl Streep and Sam Neill is a great movie about the Baby Azaria case. It shows how everyone turned against the mother, all because the media fueled the strong belief that a dingo could never, ever, have done what the mother claimed, heh. Oh, and Meryl did a great job with her fake accent. :) Of course now we know they were all wrong. Ultimately, Lindy Chamberlain was released from prison, and all charges were overturned/dropped for her and her husband in 1988, but it took until 2012 for a Northern Territory coroner to finally agree that Baby Azaria was in fact killed by dingos‚Ä¶ And to this day, the phrase Lindy cried out after she saw a dingo run out of the tent with her infant child, is still famous: ‚ÄúA dingo took my baby!‚Äù And at least now we know it was the actual TRUTH‚Ä¶"
Reddit/RareHistoricalPhotos,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A young girl and her mother were nearly attacked at the same camping site I wanna say within a few days of Azaria's death! The authorities refused to acknowledge that the dingoes in the area were growing more bold around humans. They didn't want the number of visitors at Uluru to decrease which probably had something to do with the insistence that the parents must've done it. Rip Azaria! She and her parents deserved better!
Reddit/RareHistoricalPhotos,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Sorry, I meant on land. Yeah, saltwater crocodiles are orders of magnitude more dangerous than most other predators. But they‚Äôre not gonna be roaming around the bush near Uluru"
Reddit/RareHistoricalPhotos,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is also remote. Really, really fuckin remote. It may be a popular tourist destination, but it‚Äôs way out in the desert miles and miles away from anything. If you‚Äôve ever seen the picture of a giant plateau jutting out of the outback, like a mountain with its top sheared off ‚Äî that‚Äôs Uluru. Back then it was called Ayer‚Äôs Rock"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,How often does it rain on Uluru?
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My wife and I were on a honeymoon to the Outback during an extremely rare period of rain that they had there a few years back. Literally every hike we had through the national sites there included a storm, and all the tour guides were going nuts, because they had never seen waterfalls coming off of ~~Ayers Rock~~ Uluru and other sites. I managed to nab a pretty nice picture of ~~Ayers Rock~~ Uluru with some storm clouds over it: * https://500px.com/photo/191418727/clouds-over-uluru-by-milton-georges This video certainly brought back the memory :)"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Tourists used to be able to climb Uluru, however I believe that has been stopped in the last two years. It‚Äôs a sacred place to the aboriginal people, and climbing it is very disrespectful (the comparison often made is the equivalent of climbing a church). A particularly racist and vile Australian politician got stuck up there when she climbed it as part of a protest against banning tourists from climbing it, much to the amusement of the nation."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Just Uluru :)
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I've always wanted to visit Uluru.
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Am Australian. No one ever refers to Ulu·πüu by any other name especially any reference to that fuckwit Henry Ayers. It‚Äôs Uluru. Nothing else. An extremely sacred site which should never be touched let alone climbed upon.
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is such a satisfying perspective of Uluru. It‚Äôs often displayed with aerial shots or super wide shots that show the whole thing in one frame, but this closeup ground level shot really lets you understand how massive this rock is. The little waterfalls all over it are beautiful!"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru seems to appear on almost every map in Civ 5
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Wtf I've never seen tree surrounding Uluru God Damn
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Since Uluru always spawns in the middle of dead, dry deserts, I always thought the quote was a joke, as there would never be a wet season where it is."

It's one of the only places I've visited that gave me a magical, almost mystical feeling, just by being in it's presence. John Williamson is one of Australia's most prominent and well loved folk singers who writes music pretty much exclusively about Australia and our diverse cultures. This song is as close as you can get to seeing the rock without actually seeing it."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I visited Ayers Rock once many years ago and it's still one of the hottest places I've been. I can't remember what time of year I was there but the temperatures were in the upper 50's (Celsius)

Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The mythology around Ayer's rock is simply wonderful - > The world was once a featureless place. None of the places we know existed until creator beings, in the forms of people, plants and animals, traveled widely across the land. Then, in a process of creation and destruction, they formed the landscape as we know it today. A·πâangu land is still inhabited by the spirits of dozens of these ancestral creator beings which are referred to as Tjukuritja or Waparitja. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluru#Aboriginal_myths,_legends_and_traditions"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'm from AZ and when we get heavy rain, we have flash flooding. I came to these comments to see if that's the same case in Uluru, especially since these mountains are just big rocks with no soil Just my guess as someone from a different desert, but I'd assume there would be flooding that would temporarily create pools and creeks"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Hi! I've always thought about doing a trek to Uluru, but never had a chance to talk to anyone who's done it. What was it like on the way to Uluru and what was the experience at Uluru like? I've heard from other people that there wouldn't be much to look at or do on the way there and there wouldn't be much other than Uluru once you get there. Heard there might be some aboriginal caves around, but thats it. Edit: I just wanna thank everyone for their informative responses. With the other additional activities people listed, I feel comfortable adding Uluru to my bucket list (not that additional activities make or break anything, but it's nice to be able to experience multiple things on a taxing trip). Thank you thank you thank you guys"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru. It‚Äôs **Uluru**.
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's called Uluru and as noted by another commenter, it's in Australia. What's crazy is that if you look at it on a map, you'll see that it's right in the goddam middle of Australia. The area is mostly Aboriginal sovereign land and usually permits are required to visit. If you're unfamiliar with Australia, know that there's a reason very few people live in the central areas of the continent- it is hot, dry, and harsh. Much like the natives of the Americas, the Aboriginal peoples of Australia have been treated horribly. Areas like Ayers Rock (Uluru) see more tourism than most other natural parks in Australia, but the local tribes are still very poor. To this day, there are ongoing slavery lawsuits between Aboriginal people and the Australian government. While Australia is a great country, there are many serious issues there and like the US, histories with which they have yet to adequately address."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Can confirm this is Uluru, aka the big ass rock in Australia"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Nah you're right, no Australian calls it Ayers Rock any more unless they have a very specific motive for doing so..."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You probably have, but in the wide shots of Uluru people are used to seeing, the trees almost look like scrub. Uluru is just so huge it has that effect."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is!!!! But Uluru is like a fabulous oasis, and when it rains it REALLY rains in big hits and creates flooding."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Australia, It‚Äôs called Uluru"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,*Uluru
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It‚Äôs Uluru, deserts have trees, it‚Äôs raining so it‚Äôs not as red."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For your reference, the name 'Ayer's Rock' is sort of frowned-upon now. 'Uluru' is the name given to it by Indigenous Australians. There's been a big push recently to return Australian landmarks to their original names, pre-collonialism, to recognise the original owners of the land."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Also, a lot of the tales and legends can only be told at the place thay occurred so there's no written accounts of a lot of Anangu history. I've been living at Uluru for the past 6 months and it's just such an intensely spiritual place it's impossible not to be affected by the energy both here and at Kata Tjuta. It's a place that you really have to experience in person."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Actually Uluru is more of an oasis in the middle of the desert. You can see in the clip the land around it is very green and lush, there's a lot of unique native wildlife that lives there too. Uluru sees quite a bit ob rain compared to the rest of the desert."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Only a small correction, but uluru is just one rock. Biggest one in the world."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I‚Äôm not the person you asked, but I visited Urulu back in 2002. I was a student at the time. I went on a three day camping trip around that area. We left from Alice Springs in a mini bus. The first evening we watched the sun set over the rock. I have a series of photos taken about 10 minutes apart, it‚Äôs fascinating how the rock changes colour as the sun goes down. We slept in swags under the stars, which everyone should do at least once in their lives, and just before dawn the next morning we went on a walking tour around the base of Uluru. It probably took a couple of hours. There were a few places that are considered very sacred and you‚Äôre not allowed to film/take photos. The thing that surprised me was the shape. Everyone‚Äôs seen that classic photo where it kind of looks like a loaf of bread, but close up it‚Äôs a lot more irregular. There are caves and pools of water. Some of the caves have Aboriginal art in them, which might be 100s of years old. We also visited Kata Jtata (the Olgas) which is quite close, and on the third day on the way back to Alice Springs we went to Kings Canyon (like the Grand Canyon but smaller) It‚Äôs probably changed a bit since then. Sorry if I rambled on a bit, but it was nice to share some happy memories. I hope you get a chance to go there one day."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Definitely do it! It's so worth it. Not just Uluru and Kata Tjuta but the entire Red Centre. I'm particularly fond of Kings Canyon myself but there's so much more to the Outback than just Uluru. Definitely do your research and be prepared, it's a beautiful place but can also be very dangerous."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"While we did drive a large portion of the Eastern Coast of Australia we did not drive to Uluru. We mapped the possibility but decided to fly there instead to save time. (In retrospect knowing what we know now I would advise anyone attempting our route to check the flights to Uluru first; we drove from Cairns to Sydney and then flew to Uluru--via Cairns which was the only reasonable way to get there. In hindsight we would have started our driving trek in Sydney because we had to fly in there to get to Cairns and in essence saved both money and time at the airport. What can I say, we were young and didn't have any planned agenda other than get ""lost"" in Australia.) As others have mentioned, there isn't much there and I highly recommend reading up on local customs and beliefs. Not only does this make it more interesting but it ensures you respect the indigenous peoples' way of life. Having said all of this, we thought of this as one of the highlights of a very memorable trip and I do recommend it if you can find your way there."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If I remember correctly - there's a thing in this particular tribe's culture where sacred knowledge is only allowed to be shared at sacred locations. I'm not really sure the rules, but I remember my tour guide saying he couldn't tell us a story at the campsite, we had to wait until the actual tour. By extension, certain parts of Uluru are involved in their creation myth(?), and so sharing photographs is tantamount to sharing sacred knowledge in the wrong way. Of course, it was 20 years ago, I might be remembering that wrong."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is famous for changing colours in different lights.
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Would it be disrespectfully to visit Uluru if you can get a permit or is it more or less welcomed to support the local economy? Edit: all these responses are making me really want to go! Thanks everyone!
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It‚Äôs **Uluru**. Ayers Rock name came from Henry Ayers (English migrant turned state premier). Nothing else. It‚Äôs deeply disrespectful to refer to Uluru by that name.
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Or to help tourists know what you're talking about... followed by a firm but gentle insistence on ""Uluru"". I wish we would bring back more traditional names for landmarks."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I really don't believe the beautiful earth should be held hostage based on one groups beliefs. I also don't believe in private beaches or trails... Everyone should be able to enjoy mother nature AND treat it with respect. Should people leave their trash on Uluru or piss on it? Hell no! But someone should be able to hike up it. Like I understand the natives think some holy mumbo jumbo that if someone gets hurt on the rock, their soul is trapped there or something like that? I forget the details since it has been awhile since I looked into it. But basically no one gets to climb an amazing world wonder because of some ancient , backwards , nonsense beliefs."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Yeah the area around Uluru is actually teeming with life if I remember correctly. Al the plants and animals evolved to be very resilient to dehydration but they still need rain to survive.
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Alice Springs? I got to live there when I was young, saw Uluru in the rain. It was awesome."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes they do, it's still referred to by both names but the traditional name is always given more importance. Same as Kata Tjuta is still often referred to as The Olga's."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I asked a geologist about Uluru and Kata Tjuta once, he told me that they are the vestiges of ancient mountains which were formed by extrusion then weathered away to leave what we see today. When you are there it is easy to see why they dominate the stories and culture of the Anangu people and why they are held sacred - they are the only place for hundreds of miles where water and food can be found at any time of year"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,There used to be guided climbs of Uluru before it was returned to the traditional owners - as it's a sacred place it was a very disrespectful practice. There's no disrespect in visiting and learning the stories of the Anangu people as long as you are respectful and leave nothing behind. There's nothing else out there as it's so remote so visitors are needed to keep it alive.
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Welcomed, and there's plenty to do in kata-tjuta national park. Uluru during the sunset is mind blowing. Changes from Orange, to purple, to blue."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is not disrespectful to visit, it‚Äôs the same as visiting most places in Australia, respect the land the animals and the plants, do not litter or destroy things. When it comes to Uluru, go there with the understanding that it is native land, go there with the intention to learn."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You fucking donkey Regardless of how you view religion, aboriginals believe in it, they view the site as sacred and don‚Äôt want people to climb. Right there should be enough for most people. Time for them to arrive in the 21st century? If you actually knew anything, anything at all about Australia you‚Äôd know that the government has at once killed and destroyed aboriginals for two centuries, and also hasn‚Äôt given the surviving communities 21st century resources. Fast internet, clean water and power are not given to most communities. Therefore most aboriginals still practise a more traditional way of life, not all of them and not all the time, but a definite section of the population. And again, they don‚Äôt want you to climb. You say they should arrive in the 21st century, kinda hard to go that when your people are stolen, killed, relocated, underfunded and oh yeah, genocide. Finally, again proving you don‚Äôt know anything at all, the tourism around Uluru is massive, camping grounds, luxury hotels, charter planes and buses to the site, restaurants, gift shops and car parks. It‚Äôs all owned by whites mainly, who used their resources (resources the aboriginals don‚Äôt have) to establish the tourism elements. Most aboriginals would want to make money of off Uluru, (but not by letting people climb) but again cannot do that cause of how they‚Äôve been treated historically. So we have a group of extremely disadvantaged people, who are holding onto a singular religious site of great importance. They cannot make money off if, and cannot even stop people from climbing if they really are determined to be scum. Their wishes should be respected, it‚Äôs literally the least we can do"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"That's fair, hahaha. I just went to Uluru as a kid, and didn't expect it to be so cold during the night because I didn'tunderstand the whole hemisphere thing at the time. The best part was a snowman in July on Craddle Mountain."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Sorry mate I didn‚Äôt realise when it‚Äôs raining in Florida it doesn‚Äôt rain at Uluru.
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"that's contested, people aren't sure if Kata Tjuta, a few KM away actuually connects to Uluru or is a separate piece of shell."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is an ancient sand bed deposited as part of an extensive alluvial fan originating from the Petermann Ranges. It‚Äôs a mountain of sand if you will.
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You don't need a permit to visit Uluru, rather a pass to enter the national park it sits in (these do not require a specific application process). And yes up until I think either 2020, or 2019, you could climb the rock up to the top, but it was strongly discouraged, and they'd shut down the climb if it was even slightly windy. They've recently permanently closed the climb which is great. It is a sign of disrespect in the Aboriginal community to climb it. And it is also extremely disrespectful to remove pieces of the rock, even pieces that are on the ground, to take home. It is a sacred space. I visited in 2003 through my high school, and we walked around the rock instead. It was a 9km-10km walk and extremely warm! But a beautiful way to experience it. It was so fascinating to see all of the formations, little waterfalls, the Aboriginal rock paintings, and the view from the other side of the rock which often doesn't get shown in pictures and postcards -walking around the rock is well recommended if anyone gets the chance to visit! https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/do/walks/uluru-base-walk/"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"just as pretty in the morning when it does it in [reverse](https://imgur.com/a/PQLE87Y). The first is Uluru, the second is Kata Tjuta"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,[but I‚Äôm right...](https://www.worldhistory.org/Uluru/)
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> It is a sign of disrespect in the Aboriginal community to climb it. I just want to put this in a bit of historical context. The aboriginal people were the ones that originally installed the guide chains for climbing and used to encourage tourists to climb it (and get a majority share of park permit funds). This lasted for decades. The narrative of it being offensive only started to spring up in the 90s/00s. And I don‚Äôt want to discredit it and say it‚Äôs false; if they say it‚Äôs disrespectful, then it is. But, it coincides pretty strongly with a major tourism boom from another ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúmainland‚Äù country with the largest population ‚Ä¶ and some tourists being generally awful. Uluru was being constantly littered with trash and plastic water bottles, as well as human waste (no bathrooms or portapotties on the long climb up). Additionally, some tourists have died or been seriously injured attempting the climb, and the aboriginals claim this causes them sadness & guilt of responsibility. I think that if tourists had always been respectful and clean, then the climb would still be open today."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well, it‚Äôs not always be called that, only since the 1800‚Äôs. For tens of thousands of years it‚Äôs had another name. The Pitjantjatjara people are the ones who actually look after the land, are it‚Äôs caretakers and protect the national park and Uluru itself. They‚Äôre not some random tribe, they‚Äôre the people responsible for it. What some random person who‚Äôs never done anything to protect Uluru thinks is much more silly than the people who actually live there and care about it."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,>The aboriginal people were the ones that originally installed the guide chains for climbing and used to encourage tourists to climb it (and get a majority share of park permit funds).

Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I am not really buying that story, for what it is worth. I went to Uluru on my first trip to Oz somewhere in the mid-Aughts, and climbing it was already looked down upon. I don't think the great Chinese tourist boom had kicked off by then"
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I don‚Äôt think the removed ability to climb it is a deterrent to visit. People still visit the Sydney Harbour Bridge and don‚Äôt need to climb that (it‚Äôs heck expensive to do it). Uluru still spectacular regardless of whether you climb it or not. Plus there is so much to do and see in central Aus beyond Uluru. When people visit, it‚Äôs typically either fly in and fly out of Uluru airport, or it‚Äôs a massive road trip to and from Central Aus. As far back as at least 2003 its been strongly discouraged. There was signage everywhere saying it‚Äôs disrespectful, so we didn‚Äôt climb it. Only going off what I saw and read and experienced when I visited. Also for most of the Covid period, residents from NT, WA, SA, TAS and QLD have still be able to visit. It‚Äôs mostly just NSW and VIC (and possibly ACT?) who haven‚Äôt, yes they make up a large chunk of the population but the people in the remaining states can‚Äôt travel internationally so my hope is they still had at least some domestic tourists. It is bloody expensive to travel domestically though‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a bigger deterrent for local visitors than not being able to climb it."
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Hasn‚Äôt changed jack shit in terms of numbers, has made guests far more humble and respectful.

Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Let me guess, you are an American who has never left the state they were born in and has no idea about other countries and cultures, also by the way Christianity and Judaism were both created much much later than the Dreamtime stories of the aboriginal people so what do you think of that. Also the whole resort idea is fucking dumb, firstly it would take a hell of a long time to install, secondly it would be incredibly dangerous, thirdly do you know the fucking shape of the top of uluru? Guess what, it‚Äôs not just a flat plain, fourth it takes away from the majesty of Uluru by just plonking a fucking pub on top of it. By the way there‚Äôs already a resort a few km away that is very good and I doubt your idea could ever in a million years beat theirs. Also do you know what sub you‚Äôre in?

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Glad to see. It's a beautiful sight and sacred to the indigenous Aussies there. If you ever go, Kata Tjuta is the far better attraction which is sadly not as well known or advertised."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,My cousin was a ranger there when we visited. I had given my family the choice of whether they wanted to climb it before we got there even though I had decided not to myself. After talking to him about the reasons why the local community were not in favour of visitors ascending the rock they also pulled the pin. Basically it comes down to people being injured or killed while climbing. The locals felt there was a duty of care on them to look after visitors to their land and deemed themselves failing that duty when something happened. While not explicitly stated the another reason it seems was that they regarded the spirit of those who lost their lives climbing the rock would remain at the site. Indigenous people can be incredibly superstitious and having strangers spirits wandering their place was certainly an uncomfortable thought. That is not to say they were alone in their superstitions. The mail room contains basket after basket of packages from around the world containing rocks that were taken from Uluru but sent back after visitors later learned it was bad luck to remove them. The rangers could not return them without knowing exactly where they came from so instead they continued to be stored at the center. In the end we walked the perimeter and we really glad we did. There were a couple of areas out of bounds but some of the permanent water holes and other sites were pretty awe inspiring. I'm glad the climbing will stop in 2019. edit: grammar.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"As I've heard it, 16% of tourists climb it now, but it's closed 77% of the time, i.e., only 23% of tourists have the opportunity to climb it. That sounds to me like about 70% of tourists who have the opportunity to climb Uluru do so. Yes, I'm making some assumptions here but, if the numbers are roughly right, it seems to me that quoting the 16% number is disingenuous."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I've climbed Uluru twice and I'm sad to see them close it.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I feel conflicted about this, Uluru, Is a very important cultural icon to Aboriginal Australians, but on the other hand I've always wanted to climb on Uluru just at least once. Oh well, guess it's only fair, should atleast give them this one."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"1. It's Uluru... why be a dickhead and refuse to use the name it has been called for 80,000+ years by its owners/custodians? 2. It's nothing short of amazing that Australia has indigenous Australians with direct lineal decent to this land and the culture. No other country has a living 80,000 year old people who still know their culture inside out. I lived in Japan for a while and their indigenous Ainu people are dead. Wiped out! While Japan now has lots of cool castles and stuff, they will never recover their indigenous culture, which is completely lost. Show some fucking pride in your country and respect the owners who are just trying to preserve the world's longest surviving culture!! It's fascinating shit and something I'm far more proud of than a fucking meat pie and VB. 3. It's actually the whole national park that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so it's prohibited '[t]o commit any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples'. In all honestly, we should feel privileged that the owners even let us into the national park. They could be like 'well this is a cultural site with 10's of thousands of indigenous structure, artworks and cultural sites... all this shit is priceless so GTFO unless you're here purely to protect it!!'"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,In 2003 my year level went on a Central Australia trip and we finished it off at Uluru. Before hand we had a tour of the museum part and then the guide sat us all down and tried to discourage us from climbing it. She told us the significance of it to the Aborigine people and how it wasn‚Äôt fun having to go up there and collect the bodies of people who had been stupid and fallen and died (the climb itself is extremely narrow with steep cliffs either side and a single knee height chain fence that divides up from down.. no idea if this has been changed). About 5 people in the group didn‚Äôt climb and just walked around the base. The rest of us believed we had sat on a bus for the past week to get here and we were climbing the damn thing. I completely understand the Aborigines point of view but it was damn awesome at the top and an experience I‚Äôll never forget.

The only one of these I haven't done is skydiving, I've done all the rest of these experiences at Uluru. And all of them are fun and exhilarating and rewarding in their own way.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It literally says ""Please don't climb Uluru"", I don't get people sometimes. And it's not just for spiritual reasons, people have died climbing it and the owners don't want any more deaths."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"what time of year did you go? the kata tjuta pics on google look like a zoo, i'd also like to go when its empty."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Except the view from the top is *spectacular*, despite what Lonely Planet etc claims. I climbed it back when it was allowed, and I'm not taking a position on whether it's ""wrong"" or not. I did it, and that's that. From the top, climbing at dawn, you see the shadow of the rock pointing like a long, thin dark needle towards the Olgas/Kata Tjuta, which look like opals as the sun rises and begins to catch. It really is a once-in-a-lifetime, spectacular, unique sight. I can't truthfully say that I'm sorry I climbed it. I think it's the kind of view that anyone on this earth has the right to see, if they treat it with respect and don't foul up the rock."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"IIRC, for one the main climbing path takes people past sites that were used to initiate children into either manhood or womanhood. Photographing or trampling over such sites affects the dignity of the ceremony and the status of men or women in their community. Second, in many indigenous cultures there is no such thing as an accidental death. Someone dying accidentally can be attributed to malignant intent or witchcraft. Before colonisation, if one aboriginal person visited another group's territory and died it could trigger inter group suspicion and conflict. So if an indigenous group invites you onto their land, it is greatly distressing to them if you then hurt yourself or die, as many attempted Uluru climbers have."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I dunno, I looked at both and uluru just looks more spectacular to me. Something about it's singular nature."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No. >A decade ago, 38 per cent of visitors climbed, and recent figures provided to Fairfax Media indicated that about 20 per cent climbed. >Because of the unreliability of motion sensors used to count the number of climbers, a new and independent analysis was commissioned from statisticians at Griffith University. >It estimated that only 16 per cent of visitors climb, said a spokeswoman for Parks Australia, who added that the experts took into account the days that the climb was closed because of wind and when it was considered dangerous to climb. [Source](http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/uluru-very-likely-to-close-to-climbers-its-not-a-disney-ride-says-chairman-20171031-gzccjo.html)"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"They adjusted for that. As per the article, >Mr Wilson said data collated in 2015 showed that of the days the park was open and data was collected, 16.2 per cent of visitors climbed Uluru"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This isn't true. They have staged protests to try and stop it. My dad has a t-shirt saying ""I DIDN'T climb Uluru"". It's something the elders have wanted for a long time. I'll AMA my dad who was the head ranger there for quiet a while over the later 80s."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It wasn't exactly much of a choice. The traditional owners were handed back the native title, with some conditions. They had to agree to lease the land to the government for 99 years, and part of that agreement stipulated that they could close the climb when the proportion of visitors who climbed fell below 20%. Closing the climb has always been part of the plan, they just haven't been able to do it until now - the proportion of visitors who climb is now at 16%. And to be honest, for most people, just hearing 'the Anangu would prefer you didn't, and this is why' is enough. 84% of visitors to Uluru just hear that request, and respect it. Anangu culture places an emphasis on individual responsibility. They can educate you on why it's a jerk move to climb Uluru, but ultimately, it's up to you to take that information on, to weigh your options, and to take responsibility for your decision."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> If you're one of the traditional owners of the land then more power to you and I recommend you do so. The A·πâangu people do not climb Uluru, due to its significance in the Dreamtime."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I also went to Uluru and chatted to traditional owners and got quite varied opinions. Perhaps the most common was: >""climbing the rock is dumb because there is nothing up there. All the watering holes and paintings that make the place important are around the rock. Climbing it misses the point"". Another frequent one was: >""We feel responsibility to visitors to our land and climbing the rock is dangerous. When people are injured or die we feel sad because we failed in our duty to protect our visitors"". My personal view is that liberalism should apply. Do whatever you want as long as it doesn't impact others. If you got to a cathedral in Europe as a tourist you'd be welcome to climb the spire or visit the crypts, even if that's not something someone who worships at the cathedral will do. You'd also be welcome to pray or observe a minute's silence. Sometimes they will close the cathedral for worship. Once finished they'll reopen it to tourists. I think a tourist could be sensitive to the above concerns *and* climb the rock safely *and* let the traditional owners practice as they see fit. Not everything needs to be a zero sum game."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yep, Kata Tjuta won me over 40 years ago. Beautiful magnificent place."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Let alone fuckers taking a dump or having a piss or dropping empty water bottles on the altar. All of which the tourists do while climbing Uluru.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Haha, the policeman telling him he couldn't climb it because he doesn't own it. He needs to tell that to the people who climb Uluru."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is an argument I can get behind, though I would still question a double standard of whether wonder likes the great barrier reef, Uluru etc could be claimed exclusively."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"[This](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-01/uluru-climbs-banned-after-unanimous-board-decision/9103512) source: >Mr Wilson said data collated in 2015 showed that of the days the park was open and data was collected, 16.2 per cent of visitors climbed Uluru."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I can see the situation from which you're probably coming: if you decided to swing by on your way through in like a caravan on a day trip, then yeah, you wouldn't have seen anything until you got inside the park. But if you do basically any research beforehand (there's literally a link entitled 'can I climb uluru' on the Ayers Rock resort webpage with info on the park entrance fee), especially if you've visited the visitors centre at Yulara or Mutitjulu, there's definitely literature asking you not to climb. Even if you do pay the 25 to get in, you can still use that to walk around parts of Uluru, and Kata Tjuta. Also, it's a park. It's not like a museum with no paintings or a doctors surgery with no doctors-- you're paying for entry into a park, you get entry into a park."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's a bit different this situation. Their religious and culture history, religious legends, cultural traditions and their ancestors are all entwined specifically with the land and the features in their specific tribal region, from the rivers and lakes to rocks and mountains. Ullaru is extremely sacred to them. They believe the spirits of their ancestral beings still reside there, as they have done since their creation over 60 thousand years ago. Plus they were there for tens of thousands of years before European settlers arrived. It's historically their homeland and they are the custodians. They will tell you themselves they belong to the land and have a duty to protect it. A proportion of visitors just aren't respecting it, so they are choosing to enforce a ban for the preservation of the site. http://redcentre.com.au/about-the-red-centre/uluru-in-aboriginal-culture/"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Aboriginal culture developed over thousands of years to be based around nature, not buildings. In that context, Uluru is comparable to a memorial or monument."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you have a spiritual connection to Uluru, go live near it and learn about it, don't go stomping over it then out for cocktails and back on the tour bus to the next landmark."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,There's a pretty big difference for YOU. I'm sure Indigenous people in the area put a HEAP more significance in Uluru than some war memorial that was just a bunch of murderous whites killing each other to them.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well then if you are happy to remove yourself from that history, do us a favour and remove yourself from this debate because the nuances of the Indigenous cultural claim to Uluru are clearly lost on you."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru was given back to the local people, under the proviso that they leased it back to the National Park. There was actually an agreement made between the owners and Bob Hawke that climbing was to be banned. That...didn't last long. > Can a mountain in a national park be 'owned'? That doesn't seem right to me. It's always going to be owned by someone. If not privately, then by the Government. There's areas of the rock that are still used for ceremonies to this day."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,And so did the Aboriginal tribe that was there before the current set of traditional owners. You don't seriously think that the current tribe has owned Uluru since the beginning do you?
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah, but when ""within reason"" is up to a white person we're fine with it, when ""within reason"" is up to Aboriginal Australians we're not. They're literally telling us that they think climbing Uluru is unreasonable. But apparently that didn't matter because what they think doesn't count, and the white Australians in this thread get to decide what's reasonable or not for them."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If I can resist walking into a church and pissing in the font, I think I can resist walking on Uluru. It's not about race, it's about respect for what the other holds sacred, even when you may not hold the same beliefs."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You're not allowed to walk anywhere you want in the Vatican, at the Grand Mosque or any other holy place, Uluru is no different. To you it's just a rock but to the traditional owners it's much much more."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,They converted it into a school camp type of place. I went there for Year 8 camp in 2005. The fibreglass Uluru was the mess hall. Fun times.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"and the penalties for those who do so, if caught, will be treated the same as they are now....vandalism.. A few shit heads facing sentences/suspended sentences for damaging uluru will set the message straight."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I've said this elsewhere, but it's not as though the ONLY thing to do at Uluru is to climb it. You can walk the 10km around it, hire a bike and ride around it, take a segway tour around it, take a helicopter flight over it, you can even skydive over it. (I've done all of them except skydiving, and they're all awesome ways to experience Uluru.) It's not like there's a lack of other ways to experience it and that without being able to climb it, you're having a lesser experience. There's plenty of awesome ways to experience Uluru, and none of them involve being culturally insensitive. Everybody wins!"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What about climbing over the St Peter's cathedral altar, or over the War Memorial? You'd be fine with that too? It's still ""just climbing on"" something that's sacred to people. People are still welcome to visit Uluru, just like they can visit Anzac Cove."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No it's not comparable. One is a half a billion year old natural formation, the other is a structure built out of need of a group of people. No one culture can claim a natural feature. If a family of inuits in Canada want to claim a spiritual connection to Uluru it holds the same as the natives that live in Uluru."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I think there's a distinction there between 'ownership' and 'stewardship' - the latter is how I see the government's role in areas designated as national park. (Legally, I have no idea - I'm speaking from my moral intuition rather than a legal standpoint). I don't have any problem with people having ceremonies in a national park. Hell, I got married in one. The problem I have is that religious beliefs get to dictate whether people have access to an area that is otherwise a national park. Maybe Uluru should be private land and not part of a national park - I don't know! Then again, I think about how I would feel if the Catholic church fenced off a creek in my local national park, because they'd used it for baptisms in the past. I'd be furious, and I think a lot of people would feel the same."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,That comparison would make more sense if this was Mt Kilimanjaro banning people from climbing. Uluru is not a mountain climbing achievement that die hards want to tick off their list. Like man you can't even reach the base camps of Everest without climbing a fuck ton.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,> Uluru is no different. Yes it is. It a natural geological feature. It wasn't built by any group of humans for religious purposes. It makes as much sense as Catholicism claiming The Twelve Apostles off the Great Ocean Road.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just to chip in, they close one of the tracks from 11am if the temperature reaches 36 degrees or above, and the Uluru climb from 8am at same temperature."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No, they had an independent study undertaken which factored in the times the climb was closed due to weather etc >It estimated that only 16 per cent of visitors climb, said a spokeswoman for Parks Australia, who added that the experts took into account the days that the climb was closed because of wind and when it was considered dangerous to climb.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I think it's more a case that the Traditional Owners lease the site to the government to run as a national park, rather than the other way around. They own it and can set the terms of the government lease. http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2010/10/on-this-day-aboriginal-australians-get-uluru-back"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Not necessarily, the tours only grant you access to selected parts of the palace just as the new restrictions will only grant you access to certain parts of Uluru - The ground around it."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah, I was there the first week of Oct last year and it was already reaching closing temps. Additional note on the Kata Tjuta trails, probably 70% of it is out in the open with no real shade/shelter. Adding to the necessity to heed the closure warnings. I ended up getting there later than I had planned, if I recall there is one lookout point where they put up a trail closure sign, then a second lookout point about another 40 or so minute hike. After that point is where you really become exposed and out of any shelter. I turned back at that point. As for the Uluru climb. I didn't even realise they still opened it, with all the issues surrounding it I was under the impression the Rangers used every excuse as cause to close it for safety."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Man, I can't at all speak for Uluru, like at all. I'm not even Australian. But as an American who has backpacked, like, a fucking lot, people shit and leave their shit everywhere. Awesome for you that you didn't encounter it, but I'm willing to bet that that's more to do with you not paying attention to the whole site, rather than there being no signs of vandalism/disrespect there."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I visited the Uluru some time ago (didn't go up obv) and I'm not Australian, so my view on Australian racism is basically whatever I learnt in a ""Racism in Australia and America"" course I visited at uni while I was there for a semester BUT don't you think it's hypocritical to say ""man made structures are more worthier of respect"" to a culture who specifically DOESN'T have man made structures? You imply that all your man made structures are more worthier of respect than their ""found objects"". Why? Aborigines instilled Uluru's ""worth"", otherwise it'd be a hill in the middle of red sand. A nice hill, but let's be real, I've got a lot of nice hills where I'm at. It's sacred and the mythology around it is what makes it wonderful. So yeah nah mate, what's controlling is stealing their land till 1985 and killing their children's ties to their culture but you do you."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Fair enough - I didn't realise that was the case. That said, it's not accurate to say that religious beliefs aren't a factor in the decision - they absolutely are. Regardless of how people behave while there (and don't get me wrong, I hate that people would disrespect the place), A·πâangu people have a wholly separate set of reasons why climbing and other activities aren't okay. Some of those rules I fundamentally can't agree with. I don't care how you slice it, I don't believe in places on the planet being 'for men' or 'for women' only. On one hand, I don't believe that human beings can claim to own a 600 million year old rock, but on the other hand, I claim to own my puny piece of property, so how can I talk? I guess, given that Uluru is an incredible natural wonder, I would like to see that it is _not_ owned, and that everyone who went there would treat it with respect that befits its natural beauty. Most people do, I'm sure, so maybe we're left with yet another case of a few dickheads ruining it for everyone."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's cool, just refer to the rock as Uluru, no one has called it Ayer's rock for a long time, I was introduced to it as Uluru when I was in year 3, when I was 7 and I'm 24 now. Calling it Uluru also respects the Indigenous people of Australia"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's not Ayers Rock. It was named that against the wishes of it's previous namesake, Sir Henry Ayers (I am pretty sure, but a hard thing to googlefu without an insane amount of reading), and against the wishes of the indigenous population. How had a long established name, Uluru. The name 'Ayers Rock' is a symbol of a more racist colonial time that has passed. That name is pretty much only appropriate to use in a historical context, and is openly by most Australians (funny enough, including a lot of right wing nutbags) considered outright racist in the way you used it. Don't call that monolith 'Ayers Rock', it's Uluru. &#x200B; EDIT: Because reddit has shit markdown that deletes half a post during the act of posting every now and again."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It‚Äôs no longer referred to as ayers rock.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,That's some fantastic art! I hope you don't take learning about the cultural significance of Uluru the wrong way. Not that it isn't important but not every commenter needed to separately mention it... Do you have a site for your work? A twitter or something?
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The thing that boggles my mond here is that the artist got the name right in the piece's name, and then proceeded to fuck it up... I... they must have either has enough forsight to research it and get the aboriginal name, and still called it Ayers Rock. They also didn't call it Ayers Rock in the other subreddits you posted in. I'm just boggled"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Now animate red, black and yellow coming out of the black hole to fill the sky with the flag. And don't call it Ayers Rock lol"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,That's beautiful! I'll send it to my friend who works outside Uluru - I'm sure he'll appreciate it! :D
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I God dam knew when I click on this thread there would be non stop comments crying about it being called Ayers rock. Cool art work.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's Uluru, not Ayers Rock Don't spoil your brilliant artwork with racist language. You may not be aware, but the people who 'own' it were slaughtered or brutalised by the savage, primitive colonialists when Uluru and all the surrounding lands were illegitimately seized and renamed."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,There's a pixelated Uluru in Fatal Fury 2. &#x200B; https://www.fgbg.art/game:fatal-fury-2/big-bear
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is a way way better name than Ayres rock.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I love the idea of Uluru being some ancient alien construct. I'd like to make a sci-fi series based on that concept one day.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"As per the other comments, great artwork but quite funny that the title managed to piss off both your average aussies (calling it Ayers rock) and your racist aussies (mentioning uluru in the title) lol"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayers Rock is no longer appropriate to use fyi :). This totally rocks btw. Very cool.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Beautiful! Although I understand the contention in the comments, I was at Uluru the start of this year. People there definitely do still refer to it as Ayer‚Äôs Rock, but not without it being obviously paired with Uluru (it‚Äôs true name). Not arguing as to whether it‚Äôs racist or not, but it definitely isn‚Äôt a case of ‚Äúno one‚Äôs used Ayer‚Äôs Rock in years so just say Uluru‚Äù. Lastly, beautiful piece! Gives me chills thinking about being there."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is the correct name, nobody really calls it Ayers Rock anymore. Cool art though"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Love the art mate, been a long time dream of mine to visit Ayers Rock with the family"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This looks sick, but I don't get why there is a blackhole hovering above Ayers Rock? Regardless must have taken a lot of time and effort."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Hey, I just want to say, your art is really cool, and I'm sorry it's been overshadowed by the Ayers Rock thing. It's really not that big a deal, and you wouldn't have any way to know how angry some people get."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayers rock looks great
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It's called Ayers rock champ.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A blackhole through, Electric Uluru"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great stuff. I guess Uluru itself is referenced from a photo, it looks too much like it was traced. The sky is fantastic!"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I agree I was going to comment something similar and am glad you said it first. I also want to note that once a year 1 teacher insisted every called it Ayers Rock which I did not enjoy
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I'm only 3 years older than you and I was introduced to it as Ayers Rock (though I refer to it only as Uluru). I wonder when exactly they changed how they referred to it in schools. Or maybe my school was just backwards and referred to it incorrectly for longer than they should have
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I think that would have been unusual for the time, up until 2002 it was officially referred to primarily as Ayers Rock, and I think most schools (and school books) probably took quite a while to adjust to the name changes. Kudos to them for changing the curriculum so fast, but beware generalizing your experience on that one."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Might show the age of the guy / girl who's art it is. I'm 38 and still think of it as Ayres rock sometimes too.. However, It's titled 'Uluru black hole' Perhaps we could just admire some time and effort some one put into depicting an iconic Australian land mark and leave the politics for a change instead of getting upset."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was in class of 2020 and only ever heard of it as Ayers Rock in class, the only people I heard call it uluru was my parents, maybe different states ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is and should be it's first name of course but I think it is worth preserving a place for European names because they are like it or not part of our history. Ayers rock is a name that is still correct and connected to history and the story of European invasion and settlement, many place names are connected to the expeditions and wanderings of early European settlers. Australia has countless indigenous and foreign names for places. Eg. Garriwerd/Grampians Kunanyi/My Wellington. And of course the problem with European naming was that it ignored overrode and erased in some cases Indigenous naming and significance. Rightly efforts to rename and reintroduce original indigenous names should continue. But We shouldn't try to override the European names in the same way as it is more important to preserve the story of their names. Keeping both names valid means people will always ask why it has two names and hopefully understand more of our country's troubled but historically rich past. Reconciliation will only every happen when people realise All who live on this continent have a shared past."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> It's not Ayers Rock. It was named that against the wishes of it's previous namesake, Sir Henry Ayers It's not it's, it's its"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Jesus's christ calm down, I'm Australian and I thought Uluru was the name of the land the bloody rock is in not its actual name. And op I love the art it's amazing."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When I did an exchange in France, a teacher asked about Uluru and called it ""Aires rock"", I swear to God I didn't know what she was saying bc of her accent. When I said Uluru she looked like she'd never heard of it, It seems people abroad learn it as Ayers rock and not Uluru. So honest mistake."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Dont assume malice if naevity coukd produce the same result. Hell even the airport there is still called Ayers rock. Cut people more slack. You will get more respect. Edit. Old mate deleted his reddit account
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,>Ayers Rock no it's not
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Same here, 27 and grew up calling it Ayers Rock ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è was in a school that would have been on the pulse on that kinda stuff"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Honestly, that is such a backwards position for your school/teachers to take. While the name might ""officially"" still include Ayers, using the traditional name recognises the sacred nature of Uluru to First Nations people. ""Ayers"" means nothing in Australia - it was just some dude who was the Chief Secretary of SA in the 1870s."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Mate. It's Uluru now. Always has been.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wait until you find out the most recent and correct name for this is Uluru, just like the most recent and correct name for you is ""Cunty Mcgee""."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"[The name was changed in 1993 to ‚ÄòAyers Rock / Uluru‚Äô. In 2002, the order was reversed to ‚ÄòUluru / Ayers Rock‚Äô which remains official today](https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/about/ayers-rock-or-uluru/). It definitely seems like the sentiment of this comment section is at odds with official policy. If we want people to stop calling it Ayers Rock, the name should be dropped altogether."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Just checked a few different websites in German/ Polish / French etc. Everyone is using Ayers Rock.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah as if OP actually would go and animate one of the most iconic indigenous landmarks, only to use it as an opportunity to be ""racist"" by saying ""Ayers Rock"". I personally didn't really have a clue/it never crossed my mind."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What's so harsh about telling someone not to use racist language. It's the least we have to do, given the shit that came with the colonialist's seizure and renaming of Uluru, don't you think?"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is hinted heavily at in the Wikipedia blurb when you google 'Ayers Rock'. It is also the kinda thing that most Aussies will pick up on and correct straight away. It's nothing OP would need to puzzle out in any deep and complex labyrinth of folklore. Like yanks saying shit like 'Shrimp on the Barbie'. That kind thing gets repeated in our faces by foreigners enough that those are basically fighting words. In this case, I would say that not knowing better is not an excuse for this most basic of cultural ignorance. It's a 2 second google away. I find it hard to believe that OP couldn't figure this out doing the prep work for their art project..."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I said the language was racist and assumed that OP didn't realise. We all know of the hell that the owners went through to get to this point. It's Uluru. That's all
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Born in 01 and can confirm. I mostly heard Uluru although I did hear ""Ayres rock"" from time to time when I was younger"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was in primary school in the early 90s. It was definitely Ayer's Rock when we learnt about it in grade one. Later on (maybe grade four) we learnt it was Uluru. I suspect some older conservative teachers refused to call it Uluru, while some (usually younger) lefter leaning teachers favoured the correct name."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Very interesting! I'm also 27 and only ever knew of it as Uluru. Goes to show how different schools (even those on the pulse as you say) are at different stages.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"[The name was changed in 1993 to ‚ÄòAyers Rock / Uluru‚Äô. In 2002, the order was reversed to ‚ÄòUluru / Ayers Rock‚Äô which remains official today](https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/about/ayers-rock-or-uluru/)."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Mate the name was changed from ""Ayers Rock"" to ""Ayers Rock / Uluru"", so I'm pretty sure the teacher was par for the course on that one."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Most people aren't first aborigional and most aborigionals are not Pitjantjatjara, Uluru means exact the same as Ayers to the vast vast vast majority of people - which is not a whole lot besides a big rock, it's just a name. Use of the official title respects both the traditional inhabitants of the land and new history of Australia. You should definitely acknowledge and respect the Pitjantjatjara (firstly by calling them by name instead of lumping all aboriginal people together when they are a vast collection of wildly different cultures and beliefs) but that doesn't mean you need to erase 100 years of recent history in the area. Remember that up until 2002 Ayers Rock was the primary way that Uluru was referred to. And even after that it took a long time for everyone to adjust."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Except Melbourne is the name of a city built by European settlers and Uluru is a religious landmark that Indigenous Australians have worshipped for a long time. Imagine if I just started calling the Vatican coolsville because I didn't think that Italians were people.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wikipedia is supremely unhelpful in this matter. Opening line: > Uluru (/ÀåuÀêl…ôÀàruÀê/; Pitjantjatjara: Ulu·πüu [Àà äl ä…ª ä]), also known as Ayers Rock (/Àà…õ…ôrz/ AIRS) and officially gazetted as Uluru / Ayers Rock, is a large sandstone formation in the centre of Australia. It is in the southern part of the Northern Territory, 335 km (208 mi) southwest of Alice Springs. Even if you read the whole article, which has a whole section on the name, still, nothing indicates there is anything wrong with calling it Ayers Rock. So a foreigner going from the Wikipedia article concluding that it's fine to use either name seems pretty understandable to me. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluru"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Show me the sign that says uluru from 5000 years ago, oh wait zero permanent structures before colonialism."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Exactly, that was my point. Have an upvote Use Uluru"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Not the name, the rock itself but the significance of it. When googling ""Ayers rock"" the wiki article titles Uluru comes up and the 3 sentence states its significance."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Anyone that's calling it Ayers Rock isn't pretending that the ""Uluru"" name doesn't exist. Cognitive dissonance at its finest"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There's nothing worth remembering about the ""new history"". That new history came by way of the decimation of First Nations history. As I mentioned, the person for whom ""Ayers Rock"" was named had no significance in Australia at all except that he was a rich politician involved in mining and banking - he is a footnote with zero connection to Uluru. The first non-First Nations person who saw Uluru decided to rename it without even bothering to learn if it already had a name."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Except no English speaker in Australia considers Uluru sacred, so why is it so hard for people to acknowledge the *actual name of the landmark*? The ""English"" name was imposed on it by someone who didn't even bother to find out if it had a name already. I'm sure you know why that is. What I find strange is people willing to go so hard on this subject. Is it really that painful to let it be called Uluru, the name it has always been called, for longer than it was ever called Ayers Rock?"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Curiously, the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation owns and operates Ayers Rock Resort and hasn‚Äôt sought to change its name."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"That zero permanent structures thing actually is a myth dis-proven by archeology. It was something my ancient history course covered back in highschool. Im not sure what to tell you other then that even if you're right, it's not an excuse to just rename things ... because of higher technology society.. I also never said anything about Uluru being used for 5 thousand years. For all I know it could have been only used for 5 years before William Gosse decided to rename it (according to he's own accounts), after being told the name was Uluru. You do get how that's kinda a dick move right?.... right??"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Lol here you are claiming that in your school in SA you called it Uluru so that means everyone's school must be doing the same or they ""weren't up with the times!"". I'm saying everyone has different experiences and you can't make sweeping statements, so don't be hypocritical be sarcastic."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yep, because it takes time for teachers and textbooks to adapt. Not every school has highly educated teachers and brand new textbooks. For the most part people continued to refer to it as Ayers Rock because even after 2002 that's still part of the official name."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Side note, Japanese still call it the Japanese pronunciation of Ayers Rock (and probably won't ever change it due to how it sounds in Japanese -ururu). So I wonder if tourism is part of why they stick with the name?"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"? Everyone? I dare you to have a social interaction once a day. Might be hard. But go do it, it's worth it. Meet some people. Unless, In the very small chance you meet an indigenous person that actually has a heritage and roots surrounding the meaning of the rainbow serpents giant shit vomit (which is it what it is btw) nobody will bat 2 fucks, hold on. Nobody will bat a single fuck. That you call it Uluru or Ayers Rock. You're saying it a certain way, because you want to feel validated amongst the others that also want to feel validated, so you can be a part of a club that has the awesome motto of ""we call it Uluru, and not Ayers Rock, because some people really really care about it"""
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Oh they do, do they? In that case I'm wrong. You realise it's the name of a rock. Nice blanket there by the way, or was that not intentional? Some care about the name, some don't. But to insinuate that the ones that do, or in yours; all of them. Would go as far to expressly tell you (me) that it's worse than being called a pedophile; which is in my opinion worse than not saying the right word for a rock. Is wrong. Never said my judgement was better. Mine is however, one that has lived outside. Touched some grass and had a coffee or two at a nice place. Nobody. Literally nobody cares if you call it Ayers Rock or Uluru. Because it means the same thing in a general conversation. Now if we're talking about a conversation you may be having by chance, with an Aboriginal that deeply cares about it, I'd go out of my way to respect them. Because it's their culture. Keep in mind the ""deeply cares about it"" because it's not all of them or common that it's an issue. Good night"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You know the history yeh? You know the actual name it has and that it's shared yeh? ""Ah look at me I call it Uluru suck my dick because I love indigenous people"" Look at yourself and make some changes, because nobody really gives a fuck if you call it Uluru or Ayers Rock, they are both equally correct, and you're a wanker if you think otherwise And also ""gimme karma plz"" fuck off"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"""So sorry, I meant Uluru"""
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There's nothing on the scale of western monuments. But that's not the same as saying there's nothing. There is also a lot more then that. It was largely ignored to justify colonisation and ignore indigenous claims. Which was the whole reason behind the renaming of 'Ayers Rock' back to Uluru. Also your quip about the swan is not going to age well. There are several independent pushes within the current gov't that are pushing for renaming localities with dual names or just outright. A good example of this is some of the stuff with the department of agriculture's biodiversity work. So... yeah, you're not exactly correct about that."

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Give me a list or reputable article that says Indigenous people care about the name of their rock to the degree you're saying. I also simply don't and won't try, because I already call it Uluru. It just sounds better. But in the off chance I say Ayers Rock. I'm not going to go ""oooh fucken woopsie daisy Ayers Rock, sorry I meant Uluru. Fucken suck my dick now I'm really inclusive"""
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru began to form over 550 million years ago when sand, eroding from the Peterman Ranges, built up into thick deposits. Some 50 million years later, these deposits were compressed into sandstone by the weight of a sea that eventually disappeared. Within another 100 million years, geological events caused the sandstone to tilt almost 90 degrees, resulting in Uluru."
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This brings back such memories. On a trip to Australian outback in 1996, we drove to Uluru with an undetected slow leak in a tire. Pulled into the parking lot at the base, engine cut out. Out of gas. Look at the left rear tire, flat. Time? About 5 PM. Woman at the Alice Spring airport Avis, closed up, got gas for us, brought a spare. Aussies in the outback are special people. Thank you again."
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have always wanted to see this place up close, but I also understand how sacred it is to the indigenous people, so I will never climb it (it‚Äôs now banned even if I wanted to). A question for the Aussies, is there a way I can respectfully visit Uluru that allows me to take in the wonder of this landmark without disrespecting the native culture who view it as a sacred site? Is the land immediately surrounding Uluru also considered sacred?"
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I will fight anyone here that tries to call Uluru ‚ÄúAyers Rock‚Äù.

Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I don't know man... It looks more like Ayers Rock to me.
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What's an Uluru? I just see Air's rock
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Little known fact: There used to be a pub/motel at the base of Uluru. A guy got kicked out for being pissed and got into a fight. He then drove his truck through the pub and killed some people.
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is located in the middle of Australia, literally the middle"
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Climbing was banned last year but the road around Uluru will remain. There is a visitor centre next to the rock that is managed by the traditional owners which I would highly recommend.
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It‚Äôs more commonly known by its old name Ayers Rock
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The aboriginals referred to the tourists who climbed Uluru as the Minga mob. Minga meaning ant. From a distance they looked like a line of ants making their way up the rock.
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah you can definitely go and still be respectful. There's an amazing walk around the base of Uluru and just viewing it at sunrise and sunset is breathtaking as it changes colour quite dramatically. The visitor's centre nearby is awesome too, my family also had dinner under the stars nearby and went on a local bushwalk with a First Nations guide who told us about a lot of the Dreamtime stories. It was truly amazing."
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Still listed as both, Uluru/Ayers Rock and acknowledged by both the indigenous and invading people.

Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Now referred to by its first nation name Uluru it is highly encouraged to not climb it anymore. After thousands of tourists climbing up and down it is starting to erode. It also holds massive importance to local First nations people who also request it not to be climbed.

Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I never claimed it was a *rational* fear. But seriously Australia and specifically Uluru are on the bucket list.
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is no longer called Ayers Rock. The name was officially changed back to Uluru in 1995. Uluru is the traditional and cultural land of the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara people (also collectively known as the Anangu people), and the Anangu have lived in the area around Uluru for at least 30,000 years."
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So one Elder says in an **1973** interview ""If tourists are stupid enough to climb the rock, they're welcome to it"", and suddenly all the years of campaigning by the Anangu traditional owners to stop climbs on Uluru is ""open to interpretation""?"
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Only very roughly. There are actually at least 4 different [centre points of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_points_of_Australia), and all of them are over 100km northeast-ish from Uluru."
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Yeah I‚Äôm aware but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the world at large knows it by that name. As a Californian I know that Uluru would be unheard of but a good number would know about Ayers Rock. The name change wasn‚Äôt news here.
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Do snowflakes melt on Ayers Rock?
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I read that if anyone dies at Uluru, the local people have to do a lengthy mourning ceremony, so it's bad for them if someone falls off. I don't think that they climb it as a ritual."
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Weird! I‚Äôm Californian and everyone who knows of it knows it‚Äôs Uluru.
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Agreed. I was looking at it and wondered if Ayers Rock had another name.
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Littering is illegal anywhere in australia, including uluru and regardless of the hiking prohibition. Should mt everest be closed because people litter on it? A church is not naturally occurring, and is a functional space. Your analogy is totally strained. Not to mention that great religious buildings such as the Hagia Sophia and Golden Temple are open to the public."
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Twenty years? Really? That‚Äôs as long as I‚Äôve been alive and I only heard Uluru a year ago or so.
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"That may be true, but it doesn't mean there's no littering in Australia. Uluru is also very dangerous to climb, so retrieving liter is completely impractical. No, but a church is repairable, a rock is not. You wouldn't hand every tourist the Shroud of Turin, the most sacred Christian artefact. Similarly Uluru is perhaps the most important symbol of Indigenous culture in Australia. People are free to look at it and interact with parts of it, in the same way they are for symbols of other religions. Uluru is functional for Indigenous ceremonies (in its caves and fissures), and not all of the Hagia Sophia and other monuments are available for public access (for a variety of reasons including degradation)"
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One of the unique aspects of Uluru/Ayers rock, is its homogeneity. You‚Äôd just be looking at the same thing."
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So you don‚Äôt think it says something about the cultural, historical, and spiritual significance of a place that despite all the differences between these more than 250 groups, they all agree that Uluru is important and sacred? Christians don‚Äôt even agree on where Mt Sinai even is!"
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Yeah exactly. The only reason people know it‚Äôs name is probably because their parents visited it back when it was Ayers Rock.
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah, I've never really heard another Australian call it Ayers Rock"
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Yeah if you told someone what Uluru was they‚Äôd probably think it‚Äôs some PC fad.
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Only one of those 250 groups are traditional land owners. I doubt they spent 10,000 years not climbing/walking up the rock themselves. I'd conceid one should not climb if they can't do it barefoot. >Christians don‚Äôt even agree on where Mt Sinai even is! If were going to compare the significance of the two, how's this? Sinais physical location isn't even what matters; it wouldn't even need to exist in order to be more significant. The significance of the story of Moses at Mt Sinai and it's application to Judaism, Chsitianity and Islam far outweighs any vague claim any person can make that Uluru was anything more than just a shady spot in the desert. And I wouldn't use lack-of-consensus as an arguing point when you're talking about a rock with questionable spiritual significance at best. Where the story of Moses may lack consensus; it's spiritual significance goes literally 9 steps beyond the modern demands of ""don't climb muh rock""."
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Essentially this conversation has come down to the root of all prejudice. You believe that one belief system is more significant, superior, and important than another belief system. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible to erase someone‚Äôs prejudices over Reddit. But I will ask that you do more research on not only Uluru, but also the Aboriginal people as a whole, the atrocities committed against them, and how they are today trying to regain the culture and spirituality that was taken from them. I think you will find it goes far beyond the modern demands of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt climb muh rock‚Äù"
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THIS???? **I** know it‚Äôs Uluru. But buy acknowledging the inconvenient fact that many people around the world might not, **I‚Äôm** the ignorant one??? You‚Äôre putting words in my mouth. This is what I always see in non-American views on history or similar subjects. You fix something (perhaps superficially in some cases, not this one) and pretend everything is fine and dandy across the world. Then when Americans actually acknowledge the inconvenient truth that we have a long fucking way to go everyone points out how racist just because we address issues we can‚Äôt tackle instead of pretending they don‚Äôt exist. Do I know American education is lacking? Of course, we just had a clown for President for four years(no insult to clowns intended). But I don‚Äôt have a solution to that. And what do I get for pointing out that people may not know a pretty minor fact? I get shit on. I‚Äôm trying to be helpful buy making context available. But the moment it was re-renamed everyone and everything across the globe was supposed to magically have all instances of ‚ÄúAyers Rock‚Äù replaced with ‚ÄúUluru‚Äù apparently, so my bad I suppose. I‚Äôll also have you know we‚Äôve done the same thing, Mt. McKinley was renamed Denali at some point, the original name. This was a bit of a smoother transition though because as far as I know the National Park was always Denali NP. But I‚Äôm not going to go ballistic over someone pointing this out, as if it‚Äôs something to hide. It‚Äôs just history. It happened. And if someone says it happened, I‚Äôm not going to be mad about it."
Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Oh we get a lot of Asian, European, and African history. We had an entire European history course.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I somewhat agree, however her political competence has been vastly exaggerated due to media sensationalism. For example, arguably at the height of her recent political career, her performance in the 2017 Western Australian and Queensland Election was abysmal. In WA, she got less than 5% of the vote with merely two upper house seats won while in Queensland she got 13% with only 1 seat yielded (this is despite Queensland being the home of her loony party). In both elections there were massive predictions for her party but they all fell short. Additionally, this can partially be explained by her campaigning. I can't recall the exact details, but I remember she made some embarrassing mistakes in WA when she visited the state that ruined her chances there. Not only that, but in the last federal election she gave a piss-poor terrible sobbing interview with Tracey Grimshaw where she humiliated herself on national television but bursting into tears about how victimised she feels among other such pithy remarks. Now One Nation has 2 senators from its record of 4 and barely any elected members scattered throughout the country. And we've had her latest embarrassing political stunt, in which a right-wing strong-man (Pauline) is shown shrieking on the side of Uluru complaining that she's scared of slipping off. Instead of enticing voters, I think many of them will just be pissing their pants laughing that such an embarrassing person ever got elected into politics. While many other right-wingers easily recover from such stunts (think of Boris' flying-fox stunt in London), Pauline really can't think up anything on the spot, or indeed at all."

We have people saying they have seen it, and news articles and comments from caretakers that's the case I found in a couple of minutes of google searching: * https://www.environment.gov.au/topics/national-parks/uluru-kata-tjuta-national-park/management-and-conservation/please-dont-climb * https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-10/uluru-climb-closure-breaking-point-overflow-tourists-waste/11296256 * https://twitter.com/surely_you_jest/status/916205007791255552 * https://abcnews.go.com/International/International/tourists-flock-sacred-uluru-site-climb-ban-leave/story?id=64303970 etc etc etc and then you saying it's pristine and the tourists are apparently more decent and clean there they are everywhere else in the world. I didn't know much on the subject till this piqued my interest, and maybe there is some vast Australian conspiracy to convince the world that tourists have taken a shit at Uluru, but based on the things I've seen in my own travels I have no trouble believing there's going to be asshole spoiling it. If it's a site of cultural, environmental and religious significance I fully under understand and have no problem with a measure to cut down on harm. My heart's not breaking because there's one less thing for people to stand on in the world if it guarantees it'll remain healthier for us to look at."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> maybe there is some vast Australian conspiracy to convince the world that tourists have taken a shit at Uluru, Pics or it didn't happen. Right now there are RECORD numbers of people climbing the rock - every cunt has a smart phone on them 100% of the time. So where is the evidence? I've got pictures of fucking FISH that live up there on the rock! (Wanna see? I'll post them) The top is awesome, amazing, spectacular! Climbing is an achievement - it's very, very difficult and dangerous - I don't know if you've noticed that there's not much/ anything to climb in Oz? There are only 4000 Aboriginals in the local tribe that lay claim to the rock and the most vocal critics are guilty white slacktivists, like you. I hope you never lay eyes on the rock, and if you're ever lucky enough to get out there **I hope you get a yearning to climb**, it's a natural feeling for some people and I'd fucking LAUGH if it happened to you and the fucking thing was closed. lol. I've climbed twice, I've got no kids, I care that it's closing but it no longer affects me directly. It's also mega expensive to get out there and to stay there. It's privilege for the elite, really, I believe that's how they are able to get so much support for the closure. Poor people will never experience the rock so they have nothing to lose with the added bonus of a feeling of superiority. (does it feel good OP?) ya dickhead. No one shits up there, those claims are outright lies. Show me some photographic evidence of it and I'll apologise."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Just been to Uluru two weeks ago for the first time after living here for 28 years. The whole area and colours are just so beautiful!
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru, before I went there, cynical me thought it was over rated. Proved very wrong. Such a weird vibe coming off of that big beautiful rock. Loved every minute there."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,To Uluru from where? To where did you return from Uluru?
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Highly recommend a bike ride around Uluru
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru and back to where?
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I travelled to what was then Ayers Rock in 1965 on ""bulldust"" covered dirt tracks, digging the car out of bogs with the help of strips of old carpet. But we got there and back to the main north-south road and we loved every minute of our journey through the Australian Outback. Uluru only featured a Ranger hut and one lonely Ranger. We camped where we liked and walked where we liked. These were the truly ""Good Old Days"""
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's great the first time. Just make sure you're well rested and have some good in-car entertainment lined up before you do the Glendambo to Coober Pedy stretch. It's called Gafa* Country for a reason. If you are driving from Uluru to Alice Springs (or reverse) via Lasseter and Stuart Highways (i.e. not doing the Mereenie Loop), if your car can handle some light offroad and there hasn't been any major rain recently, consider taking the Ernest Giles Road. So long as you have a 4WD and the road's been graded recently it's pretty easy. There's much less traffic, it's a beautiful drive, and you can check out the Henbury Meteorite Craters if you're into that sort of thing. The impact occurred about 4,700 years ago, and is one of only three impacts in history that have occurred in populated areas (i.e. people were actually in the area to directly witness the impact). At least one of the local Aboriginal peoples has a story about the craters being formed by a great ""fiery devil"" that came down from the sun. *Great Amounts of Fuck All."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's definitely worth doing. There is a lot of nothingness but it's pretty nothingness as you can see! Coober Pedy, Uluru, Kings Canyon, the water holes on the way to Alice Springs and the Devils Marbles are all worth the time. The stars and sunsets are amazing and some of the best I've seen. Also wildlife spotting, saw tons of wild emus, goats and camels - obviously don't drive at night! Negatives would be the sheer amount of time it takes, we did if from the Gold Coast return in 2 weeks and advise allowing more time so you can do less driving each day or stay at places longer - but just buy an Audio book or 2 and time flys. Also the ridiculous amount of flies! We had very attractive fly nets for our heads."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Top left red dirt NSW, top right sunset in SA, bottom left NT with Uluru in the distance, bottom right QLD after heavy rain and everything goes green!"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Open up the camper trailer and have a beer until someone goes past? I think that's the Aussie way. Surprisingly there was reception most the way until after Uluru. We had a spare tyres, fuel and a recently serviced car. The biggest problem would've been hitting Roos or wildlife which we thankfully managed to avoid."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is our over night stops and very briefly what there is to see: -Gold Coast -Moree -Cobar (open mines) -Port Augusta (look out for amazing salt lakes on the way to Coober Pedy) -Coober Pedy (underground town build in caves, Opal mines, one of my fav places) -Uluru (Yulara is closest town, 15km, Olgers are worth seeing, as well sunset over Uluru, you can walk and drive round the whole base) -Kings Canyon (the walks are closed over 36 degrees so we couldn't see much) -Orminston Gorge (nice camp site in the gorge next to a lovely water hole, as well as Ellery Creek Big Hole further down the road) -Alice Springs (Anzac hill for sunset) -Devils Marbles (lovely low cost campsite right in the middle, amazing view of the stars) Mt Isa -Winton (where Waltzing Matilda was first performed. Dinosaur stampede 110km off the road, worth the trip) -Longreach (Quantas museum) -Morven -Gold Coast We did it in 16 days but there was some pretty big drives in there, I think 3 weeks would've been good, just for more rest day in between. We camped but lots of these places have little motels too. The 'camper mate' app and our fly nets were our best friends. Hope this helps! :)"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'm English and the seasons definitely don't change as much in Aus, it's more like 2 seasons: wet and dry. They do say you should do everything in both as it can look completely different, apparently Uluru can have waterfalls running down it in the wet season!"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just don't do it in a shit old Hilux that can't go over 110km/h, with no AC during the middle of Summer. It was still worth it though to be honest, drove from Sydney to Adelaide to Katherine via Uluru, then back to Sydney via QLD."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We recently did a stint from TSV to Uluru and back. Serial podcasts saved our sanity. Or messed with it. Still not sure which...
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You definitely should! Depends where you're starting from and how long you have obviously but we did: Gold Coast - Moree - Cobar - Port Augusta - Coober Pedy - Uluru (Yulara) - Kings Canyon - Orminston Gorge - Alice Springs - Devils Marbles - Mt Isa - Winton - Longreach - Morven - Gold Coast We did it in 16 days but there was some pretty big drives in there, I think 3 weeks would've been good, just for more rest day in between. We camped but lots of these places have little motels too. Hope this helps :)"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did Townsville to Alice Springs (Uluru/Kings Canyon, etc) and up to Darwin. It was also an awesome route. I was heading up north for mango season at the time so it worked out pretty well."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This image was a difficult one to get, as the national park around Uluru closes at night. Luckily there was a five minute window where it was dark enough to shoot the sky before we had to leave, and the center of the Milky Way was perfectly positioned above the famous landmark. feel free to check out more of my [work](https://www.instagram.com/max.nti/) :) if anyone wanted this image as a print just flick me a message!"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When did you take this photo? Looks incredible. I just went on a walk around Uluru today during the rain this morning! Incredible place, felt lucky to see running water going down it (definitely not waterfalls though, that would've been amazing to see)"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is amazing. Uluru itself is breathtaking, but this is beyond."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I had a dream that Uluru was man made. Can‚Äôt remember much else, but it made so much sense to me.."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There are some groups that have permission to shoot after dark. We did a specific star-gazing/photography session on our recent visit. The guide spent most of the time recounting aboriginal stories about eh constellations, then tried to flog some composite shots of people with Uluru and the stars in the background. But you were free to ingore the whole lot and just walk off by yourself to take your photos if you have the right gear. We had the bad luck to have a full moon on the night, so we didn't manage anything like this though."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"As its likely a 50mm lens on a full frame camera, exposure time is limited to ~10s before you start getting star trails so he's probably taken a few dozen 8-10s shots and stacked them for the background and a much longer one for Uluru itself. (unless he has a startracker mount in which case your guess is as good as mine)"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Was there about a month ago! Took this as soon as it got dark. Uluru in the rain is pretty awesome, it rained there our second day too"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayers Rock is a beautiful place
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Some guy with that name was exploring the outback and saw a large rock that he thought looked neat. Ever since then, non-aboriginal people have been referring to it by that name. However, it already had a nicer name ""Uluru"" and it's been called that for way longer by the native people of the land. Out of respect to their culture, most people now tend to refer to it by that name. Some older people might continue to call it Ayer's rock out of habit, along with a few other people who purposefully call it that just to annoy other's."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/about/ayers-rock-or-uluru/ It‚Äôs an alternate acceptable name as per Parks Australia. A lot of people don‚Äôt realise that it‚Äôs officially it‚Äôs called Ulu·πüu/Ayers Rocks.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I mean they only use Uluru in the park, take from that what you will."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When I visited Uluru, our local tour guide said that there are parts that we weren't even supposed to _photograph_ let alone climb."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Why climb it besides the fact its a landmark? Pretty sure mount olga (i cant remember if thats how its spelled) is ""nearby"" and is way cooler to climb than uluru"
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is not the reason Uluru is impassable in game.
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"In Australia the people who live on the lands don't tend to be political. But sometimes others try to get them to be. That's when you have things like this occur. When my parents first went there, they drove the two wheeled track and shot a few dingos for their scalps to pay for their fuel. There was no climbing, because there was no chain. The town was just fuel and a bit of food. Mostly there to serve the community nearby, not a lot of tourists. When I first climbed Uluru (Ayres Rock back then). You drive up to it after crossing the countryside and climbed it. There wasn't a big bus park and a line of people. You might see a couple of other 4x4s at the base and pass some people on their way down while you were on your way up and have a chat etc. Around the back, where a road led off to the Aboriginal town, the waste as everywhere. I guess the tourists mostly took their waste with them, or rangers cleaned it up, but the town was a tip. The second time I climbed it with some relatives from overseas. Yulara was a lot bigger. There was a gate to pass through before getting too close to Uluru, run by indigenous people, but not Anangu, they were from Sydney! The place was imaculate, that gate fee clearly payed for a lot of cleanup, signs, fencing etc. This was the first time I had even heard about an issue with climbing, other than the physical dangers of course. There were a lot of visitors and if you were going to feel anything spiritual you would probably have to come at midnight when the crowds had died off. It's become political more than spiritual. A big stone power play. By the way, the view from the top is spectacular. There may be ""nothing"" around, but that's the point. It makes you realise just how unique the rock is. How isolated. The land around you goes on forever and you feel raised up in the middle of nowhere. You will never feel that way in a helicopter or see the same sights with a drone. I regret that my children will never (potentially) experience this unique experience."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ok, so... I'm torn on this, in the same way I'm torn about any sort of eco-tourism. On the one hand, I have a great respect for indigenous cultures, and think the shit-show they get from colonizers really does suck, even to this day. And there does need to be some form of natural conservation to ensure ecosystems can continue to function. But I don't think either of those should extend to blocking people off from experiencing the majesty and beauty of places like Uluru or Bear's Lodge/Devil's Tower, or any other natural wonder. In this case, I think the Anangu are in the wrong about Uluru. People *should* be allowed to climb, and the Anangu should instead welcome people to make the climb and even consider instructing tourists on their cultural practices within Uluru. Denying access to anyone is wrong, regardless of the reason. There *has* to be a happy medium."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Kata Tjuta (Mount Olga) is even more sacred, and climbing is totally forbidden there. It's so sacred, you're not even allowed to know what the ancestor spirits did there to make it so sacred."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What can you see from the top of Uluru? Nothing. Now the top of mount Olga on the other hand, you get a great view of Uluru!"
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I climbed it when I was about ten years old. I don't feel bad about it. Declaring topographic features to be sacred is a tricky business. How many people do they have to be sacred to before we restrict access to them? A hundred, a thousand, a million? Does it matter for how long they have considered it sacred? Could a group arise tomorrow and declare this, that, or another thing to be sacred? I think management of natural features must balance the interests of all users, and all of the activities those users want to engage in. But I'm not mad that climbing Uluru is now forbidden, either. I'm not calling for that policy to be reversed. Let it be."

Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Do you keep it quiet when entering a church? Do you go in trying to not show too much skin? Do you silence your phone when in a western sacred space? If yes, you're following religious rules. Why would you not follow them on the Uluru? Edit: Typo"
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You can experience the beauty from Uluru from the bottom? Why would you want to climb it? You can't see something you are standing So many people have been fighting for this for so many years and it was a huge win when it was banned
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"They *do* teach you their cultural practices at Uluru (‚Äúthey‚Äù being tour guides and the signs). All around the outside of Uluru, you can find things like caves with carved maps and symbolism and meeting places, as well as important parts of Uluru representing the events of mythological stories. They also show you the local flora and fauna and how they were used by the Indigenous population. It is amazing how much cultural and historical information there is in this one big rock. I absolutely support preserving it. Plus, there are places to hike besides Uluru - Kata Tjuta is absolutely stunning, and that‚Äôs just the best one of many. I insist that we *have* a happy medium already; climbing Uluru is basically the only you *can‚Äôt* do and everything else you can do around the site and the region is great. Besides Uluru being equivalent to a church (I‚Äôm really oversimplifying for the sake of making my point), one of the other reasons the Indigenous don‚Äôt like people climbing on it is because people die on it."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Sorry that Australia doesn‚Äôt have Mount Everest but you‚Äôve underestimated the height of Uluru.
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I thought the deal with olgas was that it is entirely passable to men but not women. In part thats why the olgas are more ok to climb because the locals didn't really want to use their only justification to be ""hey dudes can but not women"" vs uluru where even their own tribe only allow the elders to travel in times of need to convene with spirits. Bunch of religious nonsense to me, but they were shafted with land theft and while not just handing them back 300k acres of park land, I say let them have their rock because we took all their other shit."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"How about if the people who lived there call it sacred, we restrict it? Does time matter? No. If a commune in the middle of [insert western city here] arose tomorrow and declared their shared garden space to be sacred, then I would be inclined to say ‚Äòfair enough‚Äô and respect that. Uluru is not a ‚Äònatural feature‚Äô that has an inherent economic value like a forest or clay pit. Instead, it‚Äôs value comes its aesthetic power and also its history. As others have noted, the peak of Uluru is not a stunning viewpoint, so climbing it purely existed to facilitate some desire to climb a rock (a very natural and human obsession) and also give to ‚Äòdo‚Äô at Uluru- there ain‚Äôt much else out there to keep tourists around. So while I agree with your premise that the Earth should be managed with consideration. However, I feel the wants of outsiders are greatly less important than the wants of people who live there. If the Aborigine leaders wanted to monetise and allow climbing, fair play. If they want tourists to stop treading on their sacred rock, equally fair."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,There's a difference. No one is pissing on the Uluru. Or atleast that's not what I'm advocating for. Religion shouldn't stop them from exploring it.
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> begging to be climbed, I don't see Uluru itself begging for people to climb itself let alone the natives who hold it as sacred place"
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"That's such an important idea, especially here. The Anangu are already hugely marginalized. If ""piss Christ"" happened in place that was intolerant or hostile towards Christianity, that would be more of a problem. I also think there's a difference between a picture of Christ, or drawing a representation of Mohammed, and a holy site, or relic. Uluru is irreplaceable, and singular. A picture of Christ is not. There's a picture I like about equality and fairness, where it's three kids trying to look over a fence. One of the kids is tall enough, the middle kid barely can't see, and the short kid can't see at all. If you give all of the kids a step a foot tall to stand on, it helps the middle one see, but the tallest one didn't need it, and the shortest one still can't. The shortest kid needs a larger step to see, the middle one only needs a small step, and the tall one is fine as they are."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'm an atheist too dude (and as a filthy commie I dislike the idea of separate countries). But, how much are you really gaining from walking on Uluru, vs how much are you harming future generations by contributing to erosion. Also, obviously as an atheist you don't respect the religious reason for not being able to climb it, but that doesn't mean you can't respect those who live in the area and who obviously don't wish you to climb it."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"please show me evidence that the aboriginal australians climbed uluru until 20 years ago, because every reputable source i can read says that they believe it is a creation of the ancestors that is more sacred than others and do not climb it"
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"there‚Äôs nothing on top... What i‚Äôm saying is religious taboo and restriction takes different forms for different cultures. Peeing on one of Catholicism‚Äôs holiest churches is obviously bad and disrespectful for catholics. Climbing uluru represents the same for the Anangu people. For the pueblo, for example, their language is holy and cannot be spoken by ppl who are not pueblo or be used in entertainment, which is why the pueblo were not added to civ. Respecting cultural and religious traditions means respecting ALL cultural and religious traditions."

Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">""Something that is sacred is dedicated or set apart for the service or worship of a deity[1] or considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion; or inspiring awe or reverence among believers. The property is often ascribed to objects (a ""sacred artifact"" that is venerated and blessed), or places (""sacred ground"")."" Specifically, as people have explained, the Pitjantjatjara Anangu consider it sacred. While not an expert I understand that is connected to their creation stories. What is your line of questioning here supposed to lead to? That one shouldn't respect their beliefs which in turn justifies climbing Uluru?"
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If youre an explorer and like going places that not many people go to then whats so special about Uluru, probably the most famous rock on Earth? And why climb it, a place that thousands of people climb yearly? Also a big part of the philosophy of explorers is respecting the land. Any true explorer respects local cultures and customs, and the land that they explore, as to preserve it for future generations to enjoy. Its very selfish to just want to climb where you want and damage where you want in the name of 'exploration' and its spitting in the face of every true explorer. Uluru is perfectly mapped as is due to satellites and as I said you can gain a much better view from down below as you cant really see it when standing atop it, so theres not much to 'explore' up top. While I agree that I don't think man should have claim over land as land belongs to everyone, I dont think that means you should be able to just be disrespectful to people's culture. The locals to every sacred place have no legal ownership of the land and won't force you off it, so you can go if you want, but you are heavoly disrespecting them by doing so. If its an accident then they'll let you off, if its intentional then you're a dick and thats it really. You sound like the typical 13 year old edgy athiest and its really tiring, it makes me embarrassed to call myself an athiest. Just because I dont believe in gods doesn't mean other people are stupid for believing in them. People can believe in what they want, its a free world, and I only have an issue if their beliefs encroach on my freedoms which is only an issue very infrequently. Theres a difference betweeb choosing to not believe in something, and then being mean to everyone else who does believe in something. Like I said its really not that hard to just not be disrespectful, being disrespectful is an active choice and choosing it makes you a dick, no 'if's or 'but's."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There is certainly a cultural taboo among the Anangu, and has been for thousands of years. That taboo was not shared by other people until 1985. I'm not suggesting this is a good thing, but the fact is that from the time of European settlement, no regard was given to what the Anangu thought until custodianship of Uluru was given back to them in 1985. There were other signs there before then- relating to safety. Sometimes even closures due to high winds. Maybe those are the signs you're recalling."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> If youre an explorer and like going places that not many people go to then whats so special about Uluru, probably the most famous rock on Earth? And why climb it, a place that thousands of people climb yearly? I already climbed it in the 90ies before it was unacceptable to do so, i've climbed most of the major mountains at this point - still got some more i want to climb though. Respect the land is the motto but that means don't litter/destroy the place etc. That is not the same as don't go some where due to people's made up beliefs that it is sacred. Thats a human thing not a nature thing - the land doesn't give a shit about that. >Like I said its really not that hard to just not be disrespectful, being disrespectful is an active choice and choosing it makes you a dick, no 'if's or 'but's. Everyone has a different level of what is considered disrespectful. There is nothing edgy about me rejecting made up beliefs on natural landscapes. But sure you if you want to go to the level of name calling go for it - i will keep my responses at the very least civilised since i can keep my emotions in check unlike yourself."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ok so if Christians had asked ""hey please don't put our messiah in a jar of piss"" then it'd be different. If piss christ is ok, then so is climbing Uluru and drawing Mohammed. If you think any of these are unacceptable solely along the basis of ""its disrespectful to their religion"" but don't apply that logic unilaterally, you're a hypocrite. Again, my point is all of it's ok or none of it's ok"
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It was never acceptable to climb it though? Its not like in the last 30 years the locals got together and then all decided to make up a backstory for Uluru and then declare it disrespectful to trespasse. If you thought it was okay to climb it back then, then that means you didn't do enough research into the local area, and if you didn't learn much about where you were travelling then you aren't much an 'explorer', just a tourist (which is okay by the way, I'm just a tourist to most places but I don't claim that I'm an explorer). Plus its like Geography 101 to learn that high foot traffic equals a lot of erosion, thats how natural paths can form in the space of a year along a highly travelled route. So sure it may seem like just one person walking along the rock isnt a big deal, but when thousands do, eventually that all adds up and leads to extra erosion. I agree that everyone has a different level of what is disrespectful. But that doesn't mean that your description of what is and isn't disrespectful is always right. You may not think that it is disrespectful to climb Uluru, but the natives do. And since you are in their native lands and are actively disrespecting them by climbing their sacred places, then they have the authority to declare that disrespectful. Nobody is saying that you have to believe in their gods and hold that specific rock sacred to yourself, just that you respect those who's ancestry and culture traces back millenia to that rock. You can only decide on what is disrespectful to yourself, not what is disrespectful to others. And then from there you can decide whether or not you will disrespect someone. And by the definition of the word 'dick' (when used as an insult), someone who purposefully disrespects somebody else is a dick. Not really name calling, just a fact."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Don‚Äôt act like you would have ever climbed uluru if it wasn‚Äôt sacred. You would have never known about it.

It's only been in the recent times when people can have a voice online to bring awareness did any one outside of Australia really know - and even then in the 90ies Australia did not respect the natives quite the same way they do now. There were no signs back then - it was just a rock to climb. >someone who purposefully disrespects somebody else is a dick I love the hypocrisy in that statement given name calling is disrespecting some one. By the way you should really not confuse me disagreeing that we should not be allowed to climb it due to nonsense ancient beliefs versus some one who will still climb it even if there are signs. I wouldn't climb it if there are signs there but i would still strongly disagree with it. But if that still makes me be a dick for having an opinion - oh well."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"They're the ones who think their religion should trump the freedom of others. There's a difference between not adhering to their beliefs and actively disrespecting them. If someone pissed on the Uluru it's disrespectful. If someone littered there it's disrespectful. Etc. Since when should they be able to dictate the rights of others? Practise any belief you want as long as you don't impede others. It's a public place, anyone should be able to explore it. If it was a private property then the Anangu can do whatever the hell they want with it, but the fact is they don't own it."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The aborigenese of today has not experienced genocide but yes. I don't know too much about how they're treated in modern times but I imagine they have far bigger problems than tourists on the Uluru.
Reddit/gifs,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,That's really cool! Is Uluru the name of the place? Or just a neat name?
Reddit/gifs,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru, the biggest rock in the world, located in Australia. Its pretty amazing."
Reddit/gifs,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayers Rock was its colonial name that has been officially replaced by its original name of Ulu·πüu.
Reddit/gifs,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Officially it hasn't, officially it is known by both names as Uluru / Ayers Rock. The 2002 change to the name just swapped the order in which the two names are written, it didn't actually drop the name Ayers Rock entirely. I didn't realise this either, and it's long-overdue that we just officially name it Uluru and not Uluru / Colonial Compromise"
Reddit/gifs,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru AKA Ayers Rock. Located in Central Australia
Reddit/gifs,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Not known as Ayers rock anymore, it's seen as a somewhat racist colonial name for a very important indigenous location. Haven't heard it referred to as Ayers rock here for a good 15 years at least."
Reddit/gifs,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"OP cross-posted this to r/Australia and got some clapback for referring to it as Ayers Rock. It's worth noting if you are not Australian or haven't had much exposure to domestic Australian culture, you may look up the name of the rock, find it is still officially known by both names, and unknowingly use the wrong one."
Reddit/gifs,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Heard someone say Ayers Rock semi-recently and my first thought was ""Where have I heard that?"""
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I actually thought the great pyramid was roughly the same size as the Eiffel Tower. Shows what perspective can do. Uluru's a strange thing. Most of the time I never really give it much thought but every now and then I realise we have an inexplicably massive rock smack bang in the centre of our country and it blows my mind. I can't imagine what the original settlers would have thought when they made it to the area and saw that in the distance after thousands of kilometres (and weeks of travelling) of dead flat ground. Little wonder that it holds such spiritual significance.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,And Kata Tjuta is 200m taller than Uluru!
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great diagram! One of my funnest ""Uluru moments"" came 14 years ago in a YHA in Halifax, NS, Canada. I was sitting in the lounge chatting with a couple from Emerald, Qld, just a normal Aussie bloke with a gorgeous wife (if I wasn't 6'5 he might've biffed me for being so friendly/flirty with her; she didn't seem to mind though), and he proudly and loudly (chortle) claimed that Australia, while a fine country, ""really doesn't have any history"". On the wall behind him was hung up a large picture of Uluru. I simply could not resist casually replying ""well, except for that big rock on the wall behind you, mate, that's been there about 100 million years"". :) English people suffer the delusion that 100 km is a long distance. Australians and Americans suffer the delusion that 100 years is a long time. ;)"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"They omitted Burj Khalifa, Empire State Building, et al for a reason. By the way, was Uluru built by the Anangu or another nation? I am really ignorant about the history of that magnificent architecture masterpiece."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,How does Uluru compare to Mt. Augustus?
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Did a little research. While Zuma rock is not as wide as Uluru, its 725m high."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I've walked around Uluru and across the Harbour bridge, so I know their sizes first hand. I had no doubt Uluru would be bigger than all those other landmarks, but I find it surprising how much closer they are in size to the harbour bridge. I thought the state of liberty and the Pyramid would be way bigger than that. Didn't realise how big the Eiffel tower was either. Though I did read that it was the tallest man-made structure ever when it was built, so I guess I knew it was bigger than the Pyramid, but I thought it'd be closer than that."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I never thought Uluru was that big?! Holy crap.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Flying around Uluru in Google Earth's Flight Simulator mode is fun
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,God dam Ayers Rock is big
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"TIL how big the Eiffel Tower is, bigger than I thought. I mean I've seen Uluru, it's **big**, but I've never been to France. Now I don't have to! Our rock still wins."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah Ayers rock is pretty huge. Fun fact, up until the Eiffel tower was built, the great pyramid was the tallest structure built by man."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Can you climb/hike on Ayers rock?
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"From memory, the whole thing used to be underground and all the surrounding land was washed away over time leaving the denser rock which is Uluru. I think it will continue to get taller as well."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If they ever removed Uluru, Australia would fall off the map"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I‚Äôve been three times and it never, ever gets boring. Walking around it I get weird feelings and cold shivers in certain spots, I‚Äôm not religious or spiritual at all but I damn well can understand that there‚Äôs something...there. Like I dunno if it‚Äôs spirits or a weird magnetic field or fucken aliens whatever it is, I know it‚Äôs there and I‚Äôm always hyper aware of ‚Äúit‚Äù when I‚Äôm there. Real hard to explain to somebody if they haven‚Äôt been there or walked around it. There‚Äôs a reason hundreds of people from around the globe post back the ‚Äúsouvenir‚Äù rocks they stole from that place each year. The place has some legit juju happening and it can be physically felt. If anybody is planning to go there soon-ish I highly recommend the sounds of silence dinner + the field of light art show. I challenge you to find anything better than eating amazing food while watching the sun set over Uluru, getting a stargazing talk by a local guide, before being unleashed into a literal field of lights. The whole thing is surreal as fuck."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is big, really big. You might think it‚Äôs a long way down the road to the chemist, but that‚Äôs just peanuts to space! Listen..."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Eiffel Tower really is quite huge it just doesn't look that large in pictures. the pyramid being as small as if not smaller then the ET is what really suprised me, if you asked my stupid monkey brain to make this picture with guesses i would've put uluru and the pyramid at near the same size towering above the Eiffel Tower."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What's Kata Tjuta?
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,They say that it wasn't slave labour but really people devoted to the cause of building Uluru. Makes you think don't it.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Mount Everest isn‚Äôt a rock though, it‚Äôs part of the edge of the tectonic plate. Uluru is a single rock, embedded into the ground."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayers Rock. There's a name I've not heard in a long time.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,*Uluru
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is the largest \*monolith\* rock, but Mt Augustus is the largest rock overall."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yup! It's an inselberg, meaning that it's of a different geological composition that's harder than the surrounding land. There's a few different ways they can form but I'm pretty sure the ones here are all of sedimentary origin. Also I think Uluru is actually within an inselberg field, given there's a few others like it like the sisters (relatively) close by. Australia actually has quite a lot of them, so does east Africa and America, where they're known as Monadnocks after the native American word for the phenomena. They're also found off the coast of northern Norway and Sweden, where instead of forming giant 'island mountains', they just form normal islands."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you pull the great plug, aka Uluru, out, Australia sinks"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I did the Field Of Lights tour a couple of weeks ago, but the morning version. Up at 5am to go see it followed by setting the sun rise over Uluru. Pretty cool experience."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yep, I worked in Yulara for a year and I can't say I found it that exciting. I preferred Kata Tjuta and Kings Canyon."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,And it's bigger than Uluru!
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To contextualise the size of it. Uluru doesn't exist in mountain range, it's not a mountain- and it is so flat all around it that photos struggle to relay the sheer scale of it. I assumed when i was younger it was under 100 metres in height, and was gobsmacked when i first heard its taller than the eiffle tower."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The other name it is known by is the Olgas. It's a rock formation of a few rocks that were pushed out of the earth at a similar time to Uluru
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I... have no idea if your serious or not, but this completely summarises people visiting Uluru..."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Though objectivity is subjective, and both sub and objectivity are in a sense surjective (one to one, and onto), Uluru is objectively the most amazing thing on earth"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I believe that adding /s defeats the purpose of sarcasm. The first thing that caught my intention was that Uluru is the only natural feature among a bunch of man-made structures.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Unless you can find a higher authority than the Northern Territory Place Names Register, Ayers Rock is acceptable: https://www.ntlis.nt.gov.au/placenames/view.jsp?id=10532"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">\*Uluru In the local Aboriginal language, sure. The Germans don't get the shits with us calling Munchen ""Munich"" and the Italians don't get upset about English speakers referring to ""Florence"" instead of ""Firenze"", though, and I'd suggest the same logic should really apply to the large red rock too. There's no reason it can't be ""Uluru"" in Aboriginal and ""Ayer's Rock"" in English, and people can use whichever one they like."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Entirely agree. Having been to both, Uluru is far more scenic! And MUCH quicker to walk around!"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A monocline, so Uluru remains bigger monolith"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It is called Pine Gap and not far from Uluru.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Of course, I'm just saying that when you're contextualizing the scale of something you generally juxtapose it with similar things, in this case other large geological formations. Which don't have to be mountains btw, you could compare it to other notable inselbergs (yes that's the geological name for the kind of formation Uluru is, yes it sounds like an iceberg where we quarantined all the incels), plateaus, or massive cliffs like in Dover that are perhaps more alike. Maybe people are more familiar with monuments but it's a bit strange to me when we're dealing with something that's so much larger, like using a banana to understand the scale of a cruise ship"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"They weren't pushed out of anything. &#x200B; Back in ye olden days, the WA land mass and NT land mass collided, pushing up a mountain range 15 km high. &#x200B; This mountain range eroded down and formed layers - boulders at the bottom - then layers of gravel stone - then layers of sandstone - topped by layers of siltstone. &#x200B; Ages later the whole bedding layer was twisted and uplifted at an angle. The lower layers exposed in the west and the upper layers in the east. &#x200B; Another round of erosion occurred. At the western end we now have Kata Tjuta-Olgas, made out of gravelstone. In the middle is Uluru-Ayers Rock made out of sandstone. In the east almost all the silstone has eroded away - apart from one place where the siltstone was capped by a harder rock layer protecting it. There is now a siltstone mese there named Mt Connor.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Eh, it's more complex than that. For starters English contains all the phonemes for Uluru, which can't be said for those examples. More importantly I think it's worthwhile using original Aboriginal words where possible as a small gesture considering their utter cultural destruction. Naming it after an actual person is an extra level of insulting. English guy: ""I discovered a big rock, and will name it after me!"" Aboriginals: ""Um mate, we've already got a name for this thing we've been aware of for 50000 years."""
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The difference is that with Munich/Munchen it is a translated word, Ayer‚Äôs Rock is a completely separate name to Uluru with no link to it."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"In case you aren't aware why your comment is controversial and coping downvotes. Those situations aren't analogues.'Munich' and 'Florence' are completely different to 'Ayres Rock'. They're anglocised words. Foreign language words that are pronounced and written in a way that makes them easier for English native speakers to read and pronounce. The words have the same meaning and origin. 'Ayer's Rock' is not the anglocised word for 'Uluru' it it is a name chosen to honour Henry Ayre, South Australian Premier, by William Gosse. An analogue would be if the Hawaiian islands were instead called 'Cook Islands', or if Crimea was now renamed to Putinania. Like going to Botswana and referring to it as 'Bechuanaland' that name that the British gave the country while it controlled it's land. Or visit Sri Lanka and insist on still calling it Ceylon (the name used when it was a British colony, in reference to what the previous Portuguese colony called it)."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Firstly, it's traditionally and culturally respectful. Secondly, people in Australia don't call it Ayers Rock, because it's called Uluru. Thirdly, in 1985 the Australian government handed ownership of Uluru back to the Pitjantjatjara people - who call it Uluru. Lastly, it was called Uluru first!"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I totally get what you're saying, but scale maps sometimes do mix 'large and small' and different category objects in order to make a point. I feel like natural formations are hard enough to visualise in a way that does it justice, whereas buildings and monuments are things people spend a lot of time around, both up close and at distances where they can be seen standing against other structures small, medium, and large. The reason I was so wrong about my preconception of Uluru personally, is because photos taken of it have to be done wayyyy further in the distance than you expect or can even really tell given the perspective of the terrain. What makes the place special is not really that it's so huge in comparison to world natural formations, but just that it's so huge and imposing in the particular place and way that it is. Kinda like how the Giant's Causeway is not impressive just because it's a bunch of big rocks, but the specific conditions and natural beauty in the context of where the formations took shape, if you get my meaning."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is privately owned
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It doesn‚Äôt matter what you call it. You call it Uluru, many others still call it Ayers Rock. People still are going to know what you‚Äôre referring to.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,There are still things to do. Walking tours around the base that give some insight into the cultural significance of the Uluru. Still get to go see arguably the most iconic landmark Australia has to offer in person. Though I can‚Äôt speak on if Tourist numbers are down or not.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Isn't the valley of winds walk at Kata Tjuta? A lot of tourists that go to Uluru go there too!

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You can still go! Despite being an Australian with exclusively British heritage I genuinely felt that visiting Uluru was like going on a pilgrimage. It was almost spiritual. Climing the rock is closed now, but you can annoy it by driving to the viewing locations and doing a guided walk around the base. There‚Äôs the nearby Olgas, which have a variety of easy to more challenging walks. And usually people also stop at Kings Canyon as part of their journey. The walk at the start almost killed me, as an alternative there‚Äôs a beautiful walk along the bottom of the Canyon."

There is a community that lives in the same national park that Uluru is also in correct? So if someone with Covid were to trespass illegally while it wasn‚Äôt open to the public, they could infect people and endanger lives correct? I was never wrong I just wasn‚Äôt super specific. I never disrespected the people who live in that park. I never said they lived at Uluru, I said ‚Äúthey live there‚Äù. They live in the same park where Uluru is. Edit: I was also not talking about any resort towns, I was talking about the aboriginal community that lives there."

To answer your further questions: >There is a community that lives in the same national park that Uluru is also in correct? Yes this is correct, it's Mutijulu > if someone with Covid were to trespass illegally while it wasn‚Äôt open to the public, Yes. In Australia it is illegal to enter an Aboriginal community without invitation or justified purpose at any time. This is managed by the relevant Land Councils.

Reddit/SteamDeck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Not usually! Like I said, we got really lucky because Uluru usually doesn‚Äôt get rain, and when it does, the rain fall creates waterfalls in the rock. Very beautiful to see although if you‚Äôre ever going to the Australian outback BUY A BUG NET!"
Reddit/Art,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I love it! is there a particular reason you chose Uluru? (sorry if getting to off-tangent, but this is said to be the location of the Earth's solar plexus chakra, and obviously it is sacred to native Australians)."

Reddit/miniminutemanfans,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's obviously high quality chocolate. Big cocoa wants to hoard it for themselves while they continue to give us the shitty stuff. The Australian natives (we can't be bothered to learn the official names of people groups) originally made pyramids out of chocolate, and they were kept cold during the ice age. Sadly, most of them melted after the ice age. Uluru is the last remaining chocolate pyramid because the natives covered the what was left in cocoa pods. They weren't able to get all of it covered in time, which is why it isn't a perfect pyramid anymore. Seriously though, the cocoa industry is extremely corrupt and really supports unethical labor practices i.e. child slave labor"
Reddit/miniminutemanfans,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It definitely looks like a one story stone building that was melted. WHY DON'T YOU DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND FIND OUT HOW BIG ULURU IS
Reddit/miniminutemanfans,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well Uluru is a 1 Tile impassible Natural Wonder that gives +2 Faith and Culture to all adjacent tiles.

Reddit/miniminutemanfans,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru was fun too. You could jump over those little ridges which were just big enough to make it feel like leaping over a ravine at the top of the world with the horizon all around, but not big enough to be scary for a 14 year old."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Went to flightscanner. Put in Perth to Uluru, chose two green dates (cheapest) and hit go. For the cheapest flight, $930 return for one person with a 18 hour travel time for the first leg that has me leaving Perth at 5.55pm and arriving into Uluru at 1.40pm the next day. The return leg leaves Uluru at 2.40pm but doesnt arrive back in Perth until 7.20am the next day. This is probably why for a vast majority of people who travel interstate. You would need to add on additional hotels etc just to get there and back. When you can get to SE Asia in 6 hours and for half the price, why would interstate tourists even bother?"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Went on a 6 days family holiday there last year. Will never go back. Uluru was really neat and were glad we got it off the bucket list but everything else about the holiday was a shit show. A lot of the visitors are older international tour groups as well that have still not fully resumed to normal levels. 1) flights into yalara are insane, $850/pax from Melbourne where as it was only $350 into Alice 2) Accommodation at Uluru is not nice unless you stay absolute top tier. When we went they still had a lot of the resorts/rooms unavailable to book due to staff issues. Everything took forever, room was dirty, property was not maintained. Not fun at all, felt like we just wasted so much money out of some form of ""social responsibility"" 3) Alice Springs has fallen into a police state of nightly violence and crime. Our last night there we went out for dinner walked from the restaurant to a taxi queue, while waiting watched someone stab a taxi driver in the shoulder with a pair of scissors over an unpaid fare. Guy was not even the passenger in the taxi just looking for violence. Stabber and the passenger were blind drunk at 8pm. Went on a guided 4x4 tour and spoke with the guide who grew up in Alice. In 2019 he said he moved his family to Queensland to get away from the violence, he operates the tour company with a partner now and they fly back and forth to keep the business going without having their families in Alice. He was dealing with multiple home break-ins a year, car thefts, his wife being assaulted was the final straw."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"*""Ms Manison also said there was a ""social responsibility for all Australians to make sure they are travelling to the Northern Territory"" to help improve economic outcomes for the jurisdiction.""* Absolutely idiotically entitled take. I enjoyed Uluru a lot, but the accomodation was absurdly overpriced for what it was and I didn't have to deal with any of the Alice Springs shenanigans. Try making the experience better value, easier and cheaper to get to and the jump-off town safer...you'd probably find it would compete better in the market."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was there last year. The resort is nothing like what I remember from a prior visit about 15 years ago: - There's a focus on high-end experiences with high-end prices. That's fine, but it wouldn't hurt to maintain the cheaper accommodation or the campground a bit better. Everything was run down and tired, and in need of more maintenance than just a lick of paint or some watering of the grass to make it look and feel like a nice place. - There are no staff. When I was there, the petrol station was open during limited hours because the staff had other jobs cleaning rooms or running tours. Not great for the road-tripping contingent. - Everything takes forever. See above - there are no staff. Check-in, paying for fuel, getting a meal. Be prepared to wait. My Calipo melted between picking it out of the freezer and paying for it at the counter. - There is no competition and no incentive to do better - either in terms of services, prices, or amenities. - There was a weird approach to alcohol. You can't just go to a bar or restaurant and buy a beer. You need a ticket or a voucher to do so. I don't know exactly how it worked (are there per-person consumption limits?) because I didn't have alcohol with my meal, but it's not conducive to a smooth or welcoming tourist experience. - The cultural experiences are great. Expensive but great. Limited opening hours made it difficult to fit everything into a reasonable timeframe. As an aside, a friend lived and worked there as a pilot. Living conditions and ""perks"" to keep him there were slowly eroded once GPT sold the resort to the Indigenous Land Corporation. He left and now flies for an airline in Asia. Would I go back? Sure, I will, but I hope things improve a lot before then. It's not a good way to represent one of our more iconic natural wonders. My experience gels with what I had heard about it in the leadup to my (somewhat accidental - we weren't planning to be within about 500km of Uluru) trip but it was a surprise to see it for myself. I suspect the word is out that it's expensive and poor value."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Another reason why people arent going is because of the absolute monopoly that is Yulara. Australians love camping, in 2017 the popular app Wikicamps had 50+ free campsites listed in and around the Uluru area, on little bush tracks tucked away, and heaps of desert camping. By 2019 it was all gone from the app, with signs up all along the Lasseter HWY saying to keep away. This pretty much forces you into Yulara, an overpriced town that feels like you're in a Swedish prison."

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"the three factors potentially causing this other than covid. 1: the uluru climbing ban.2: the crazy violence in surrounding areas.3: flight costs going through the roof (thanks Qantas former CEO). But for real, why not allow climbing? there are plenty of sites that allow climbing across the world that are ancient and heritage sites to specific cultures. I never understood why exactly they gave the ban?"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We planned a trip to see Uluru. Want to know why we never went? The prices... the airfares and accommodation were like going overseas. who do they think they are charging those pricesü§£
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"blind freddy could see this happening. The demand for Uluru slumped immediately after the climb was stopped. The demand based element of flight prices could be seen with astronomical pricing and demand leading up to the close, and immediate drop back the day after (I remember looking to se if a quick trip before it closed was reasonable - it wasn't) It is expensive to get there/stay there, but there isn't that aspect which was a major drawcard. No surprise the tourism will slump compared to what they used to have. call me cynical but I expect it to be like other places that close down due to cultural reasons, only to be reopened but with an additional fee for a cultural guide who somehow makes it all ok to do what was being done before."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Voyages (the company humanized in the article as being indigenous owned) monopolizes the whole place, it's not just that airfares are expensive, accommodation is something like $400 a night and you have no alternative if you want to spend time there, they're just as much a problem. The whole concept needs to be thought through again, a daily coach tour or hire car from Alice Springs that also takes you past Mount Connor and Kata Tjuta is a better way to go about seeing more for less. Re the ministers comments, Australia at large is a shit-tier tourism destination, we probably lose billions in respect to foreigners visiting the biggest cities + Uluru and not wanting to come back at all (this is also a jab at Sydney lol), attributable for some of the reasons outlined before. We aren't a country that ticks by foreign or domestic tourism, some smaller towns might do so but it usually ends at council. Nobody owes you anything and planning around it is just point blank bad financial planning,"

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My partner and I flew into Darwin, hired a 4WD camper, drove down and visited most things along the way like Litchfield National Park, Katherine, Devils Marbles, Uluru, and looped back up to Alice Springs via Kings Canyon and Redbank Gorge on the Mereenie Loop (wish we had more time to see more of the MacDonnell Ranges). We went on a bunch of hikes, waterfalls, and swimming holes in those places and in between, although we also missed Kakadu unfortunately. From Alice we flew back to Sydney where we only paid a bit extra to drop the 4WD camper. Pretty sure this whole trip cost us ~$3000-$3500 for the 10 or 11 days, so about $1.5k-$1.75k each. But this included everything - flights, car rental (and accommodation since we slept in the 4WD camper), one night accoms in Darwin and Alice, fuel (got a bit expensive the more outback you went), and food. And my partner and I look back on this fondly as our favourite interstate trip. I think if you only went to Ulu·πüu flying in from Yulara, you‚Äôre gonna have an overpriced trip and makes it less worth it."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just searched for quickest to avoid the Jetstar layover and surprise, it's almost twice the cost at $1700 per person for a Qantas flight that takes 11 hours including a stopover in Sydney. For comparison, a flight to Bali (because, obvs) for the same dates was $467 return per person and they were the next category up of ""expensive"" on the website, being orange dates. Flight time just less than 4 hours and accomodation likely to be cheaper when you get there too. In this economy, those fares, flight times and amenities at Uluru just don't see value for money."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Best way to do it is to hire a campervan. I know not everyone can do it but in 2021 we did just that, flew in and hired a campervan at Darwin, made our way down to Uluru and flew out of Alice. Took us 10 days. Wish we could‚Äôve done it for much longer."

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I found flights okay if you go with Jetstar direct to Ayers Rock Airport. They constantly have sales on for flights from Melbourne. Accomodation prices are actually insane in Yulara! I loved going there and I loved being able to take my grandparents to a place they haven't been but my goodness a 5 day holiday adds up
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"By the end very few people were climbing anyway, and the rate was declining. It was endangering highly localised species. The rubbish, piss, and shit left behind by visitors was fouling up the fragile ecosystems on the rock as well as the surrounding water systems. Anangu found all this disrespectful, which is fair enough. People don't want Anzac memorials or fragile areas of national parks treated this way. The relationship Anangu have with sites around Uluru goes beyond this, however. It doesn't neatly translate or have a direct equivalent, because it is an integral part of a radically different cosmology/ontology/relationality (keep in mind that the last uncontacted group, the 'Pintupi Nine', were only brought in in 1984). I'm happy to go into this further/provide resources if anyone is interested. So there's the declining commercial significance of climbing Uluru, environmental concerns, and the very genuine cultural connection to land (cultural meaning linguistic, cosmological, ontological etc.), the depth and dimensions of which are not immediately apparent. Almost forgot that on top of all that, there are the safety concerns. >Thirty seven people have died climbing Uluru since 1950, the last as recently as July 2018.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yulara is crime infested? You do know Alice Springs is 470km from Uluru, right?"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The statistics say otherwise. Prior to closure the rate of visitors climbing Uluru had dropped to its lowest ever and was still declining.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Qantas cancelled my direct flights from Uluru to Cairns last year and we had to route through Sydney. Of course there were delays so we almost missed our connecting flight.

For a family of 3 we probably spent 4-5k on the trip, had 1 fun experience not related to Ularu, got eaten alive by flies, ate shitty food most of the trip and capped it off with having to explain to my 6yr old son why the cab driver got stabbed for no apparent reason."

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Look, as much as I personally disagree with the act itself, I'm supportive of the rights of the Aboriginal people to close Uluru to climbers and other visitors.... but this 'dangerous' claim is demonstrably stupid and detracts from more legitimate arguments, since it just gives naysayers something to cling to. During the same period you cite, over 9,000 pedestrians were killed in Australia just walking down the street or crossing the road. We don't forbid being a pedestrian as a 'dangerous' activity.

After a while that picked up into a shower, then eventually a storm, and then sheer torrential rain. It's genuinely awe inspiring.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visited uluru in 2010. It was incredibly rainy that winter in the area and when we got there it had already been storming all morning. We all felt kind of bummed, but the tour guide said we were really lucky because rarely does anyone ever get to see the wet side of the area. It was pretty sweet. There were little water falls everywhere, pools or water and nice little plants. We got soaked but man was it fun."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Shrimp living in honest to fuck the God damn last place I would ever expect to find a shrimp. Killed by a shit man that's sad. If I found a shrimp on Uluru I would honestly shit myself aswell.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Huge overreaction with not using the politically correct name of Uluru. Never change, /r/australia."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru changes colour ? That‚Äôs amazing I had no idea, how is this not more known"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It'll confuse the tourists. Uluru = orange. Come and see it.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"parents visited in the 80s and i remember a postcard or wall poster with 9 or 12 photos of uluru all with different colour. [sunset and sunrise](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/10/fd/81/10fd81659edcc9309d4b4a29399960f7.jpg) provide many of the colours, but also as in OP rain and clouds change it too."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When my parents visited nearly 20 years ago now, Uluru was blue and streaming with water."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Is it though? Sincerely, I've got no idea. However, I also lived out there for a stint, and seeing it wet was completely different. It's like it gets a wash. There's literally rust on it, that oxidation is why it's that colour. When it's wet it reveals more of the fresh arkose, which is grey. You can have grey and red patches next to eachother, at touching distance, dry. That's not refraction is it? Arkose is just a different colour... Like, there's patches on uluru that flake off, and underneath it's grey, which turns orange on the surface over time. Even after a storm, you see it change colour the days after as the surface oxidates again... Unless I'm missing something, like literally all colour is because of refraction..."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,what assumptions exactly? That the original owners want to call it Uluru?
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Well akshually many aborigines are happy for the tourist dollars and only SJW libtards who are the real racists are against defecating on Ayers Rock /s
Reddit/theydidthemath,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For the first one: Antipode of Uluru is in the middle of the Atlantic, falling far to the east of US and actually relatively south of the entirety of Arizona too. Barringer Crater's antipode therefore falls off the coast of Madagascar to the southeast by a fair distance. I'll let someone else deal with force, because that's a wild question."
Reddit/theydidthemath,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Weirdly enough, there is evidence of this EXACT THING happening on Mercury! https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloris_Planitia The Caloris basin was created when a ~62 mile diameter object slammed into the planet. At the exact antipode of the impact site there are a series of hills and ridges that many scientists believe were created by the shockwaves of the impact circling the globe and converging together. https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975Moon...12..159S/abstract That being said, the ridges are on the order of 10m tall (still significant for how smooth Mercury is) so these are 35x smaller than Uluru. If we assume that the ridge size is proportional to impact energy, you would need 35x more energy than the 2x10^27 joules that created the Caloris crater, so 7x10^28 joules. The meteor that formed the Yucat√°n crater and wiped out the dinosaurs was only 7x10^19 joules, so you‚Äôd need a meteor 1,000,000,000 times more powerful to create Uluru. (Note that this is assuming that the seismic behavior is similar between Earth and Mercury, which is 100% untrue but gives a good enough ROM to see how absurd this would be) EDIT: after doing some additional research, it looks like energy goes as wave magnitude squared. So that means we need 1225x more energy instead of just 35x. So the total energy goes up to 25x10^29 joules."
Reddit/theydidthemath,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,When did the impact happen and when was Uluru formed? We need a geologist here.
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Beautiful photo! I was there this past May for a few days. My first trip to Australia and Uluru is absolutely stunning. It rained for most of the time we were there, which was disappointing at first‚Ä¶until the waterfalls started to cascade down all around the rock face. It was so gorgeous!"
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayers Rock you bewdy
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Looks like Ayers Rock to me
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Are you serious? The distance. Most of us live on the coast. Uluru is in the centre of the continent. To get there by car is like a 2 day drive from almost anywhere where the majority of us live. To fly there is crazy expensive. Alice Springs is also like a war zone of crime. Doesn't endear people to stay there even for the experience of Uluru.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Right now the crime in Alice is over the top, you literally cannot go out after dark. Is seeing Uluru worth the risk to your family and belongings it takes to get there."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I just searched on google for how long it would take me to drive there. Yeah.. nah In the last year I've literally not even travelled 50km away from my home town (Helensburgh NSW). Not because I'm boring or anything, there's just so much to do and explore. At this rate of exploration, I should reach Uluru in about the year 2080."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Essentially for our family it comes down to priorities. Until my recent retirement, my husband and I could rarely take leave at the same time if we wanted our kids to be with at least one parent during school holidays; family holiday time where both parents were available at the same time was a precious commodity. We used that joint time to visit our respective families overseas. Taking three young boys to Uluru as a solo parent was not an appealing proposition - too far, too restrictive, too expensive for the quality of the experience. Easier by far to take them to Fiji etc, or just to places like the Gold Coast or Port Douglas."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I don't see anything appealing about Ayers Rock.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Nah. It's just an old rock. I've got some rocks in my backyard. I'm gonna have a beer, lay on the ground for a while, look up and imagine my backyard rocks are really big like Uluru. ""Hay Sharon, bring me another beer will ya luv..."""
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I would like to go and hike around Uluru, Kings Canyon and Kata Tju·πØa. I‚Äôve got two tween kids though and they would not be interested in that. Maybe when they‚Äôre older I‚Äôll take them, or go by myself once they‚Äôre grown."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It takes longer to fly from my town to uluru than it does to fly to Los Angeles.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It‚Äôs Ayers Rock‚Ä¶Ulu·πüu for the coons
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Travelling within Australia is expensive. I have never considered Uluru mostly because I don't have a bucket list of things to see and do out there that will justify the cost.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Cost - I did think about it, maybe a year ago, for around now, end Nov (so not cold, and not hot, now seems to be the sweet spot). The cost knocked it on the head, so went to Tasmania instead (less than half the cost, and really enjoyable, can't go wrong with anywhere in Tassie). May get to AYERS Rock one day, before the whole of central Australia is off limits to everyone, except for a few. Gets more and more annoying as time passes that even as a born here Australian, I can't go to all of Australia, but that's another story ;-)"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Do some people still call it ayers rock?
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I've been before and after we were banned from climbing Ayers Rock. It's underwhelming without being able to climb it, and going through Alice Springs is horrible due to the people inhabiting it."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,No point in going if you cant climb ayers rock
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I will state this first: the climbing ban doesn't factor into my decision. For the time and cost to go to Uluru there are other places in Australia which are as spectacular, cheaper and much more accessible to get to."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Hello! I'm not Australian but I did travel around Aus ten years ago. I saw Uluru and Kata Juta on a Groovy grape tour. A small bus tour starting from Alice Springs, might be a cheaper/same price option as staying in a hotel at Uluru for one night? And more fun! I highly recommend (if they are still going a decade later! Shout out to Clancy the awesome tour guide. ü§ô"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The fact that it is no longer possible to sit on top of Uluru and admire the desert landscape.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Because Australia has just as many lovely places to visit, where I will actually feel welcomed to go. I did a short stint in Alice Springs for work, and the 2 months I spent in Alice Springs was enough for me to never want to go back. I also did another stint in a regional indigenous community (Fitzroy crossing) and had no issues with the locals whom were lovely enough. The locals don't want us there, so I rather give my money to people that do. I'm fine with the whole not climbing Uluru since it's a sacred site, but the level of disdain they have for tourists, I would rather go to exmouth, busseltom/ Margaret River, regional NSW, QLD even tasmania where the locals actually treat tourists with respect."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Cost. I wanted to go to parrtjima and uluru for my 40th. Cost would be around $8-10000.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Flights, and accommodation to visit Ayers Rock and we can even walk up it anymore. For the same price you can see a million other better places. It's on the list but at the bottom."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Being a single female traveller who is not into group travel, I visit places where I feel safe. Unfortunately Uluru isn't on the safe list"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Cost. Extra costs. What else to do when there. Can‚Äôt drive there from where I live as too hard. Would be very tempted with a 3-4 day deal for a couple. But not sure what I‚Äôd do to fill in time beyond Uluru. My fault for not researching.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A lack of interest in Uluru.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is amazing but nothing is worth visiting Alice Springs. If you've ever been there you know.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Because I don't fancy visiting a place incorrectly described as the biggest monolith in Australia: [https://www.westernaustralia.com/au/plan-my-trip/planning-tools/travel-stories/australias-biggest-rock-and-it-isnt-uluru](https://www.westernaustralia.com/au/plan-my-trip/planning-tools/travel-stories/australias-biggest-rock-and-it-isnt-uluru)
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Money, not enough free time, there are other places I'd want to see before Uluru and I don't like hot weather."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After being there myself, I loved it. Found the walk at Kata Tjuta was way better, less people and shaded spots to relax at. However, my 2 cents, I think people prefer travelling to SEA or Asia in general because we can travel for the same cost but live like the rich. With cost of living now I think people just want a taste of life without having to worry about $ and SEA countries provide that for us. So I think this might be stopping people."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We got a great deal on those Jetstar flights‚Ä¶ who knows what time we‚Äôll end up actually getting there and getting home given it‚Äôs Jetstar lol, but for $89 + baggage each way from Melb to Uluru direct, had to do it! We booked three nights at the Outback Hotel at Ayers Rock Resort and it‚Äôs costing my friend and I a total of $756 for the three nights, for a room with 2 queen beds‚Ä¶ reviews and pics look fine‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre going in March, so probably not the best time of year to go as still very hot but it‚Äôs what suited our work schedules. Maybe time of year changes the accommodation price, but I thought it was a pretty sweet deal for 3 nights."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The only place to stay out there is all under the Ayers Rock resort. It‚Äôs a series of hotels with different levels of prices and amenities. There is a campground with cabins and tent/caravan sites which is possibly the cheapest option. But it‚Äôs ALL operated by the same umbrella company. None of it could be called cheap. But still well worth a visit. Fantastic area. Great walks. Not just Uluru but Kata Tju·πØa. And kings Canyon as a side trip on the way out.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you live on the east coast, it's often cheaper to go to NZ than to Uluru."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I loved Uluru but man you‚Äôre really tempting me with the crocodiles
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is in Yulara which has an airport, they are both a 5 hour drive away from Alice Springs. What does the crime in another town 5 hours away have to do with anything? Also return flights are around $400."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I was there when it was raining and waterfalls were coming off Uluru. That shit was pretty spectacular.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Do you live in Australia? It shouldn‚Äôt take more than about 6hrs to fly from anywhere in Australia since Uluru is in the middle of the country. It‚Äôs about 16hrs to fly from the east coast to LAX
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I honestly don't think being able to climb it would add that much. (And this is coming from a climber who loves to climb to the top of everything). When you are up there you can't really see the beauty of the rock itself and can only look into the flat surrounding of uluru. For me the most special was the drive into the national park approaching the rock. You are on this winding road and after every corner you see Uluru getting closer and closer. This huge perfect rock that seems completely out of place in this otherwise flat landscape. It was really cool imo. I understand the cost thing. Though if you have the time for a road trip and are willing to give up a bit of comfort and luxury it doesn't have to be all that expensive. There are still free camping options available nearby (look on wikicamps australia app). So you could do a roadtrip there and maybe combine with kata tjuta, king's canyon and macdonnel ranges and whatever interesting there is in between there and where you live while only paying for fuel and cheap food."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Technically the big Uluru is the small Uluru
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Yeah so basically it IS just a big rock but has tens of thousands of years of history and significance. That usually isn‚Äôt people‚Äôs thing. Most people don‚Äôt go to FNQLD specifically to visit the oldest rainforest in the world. Most people don‚Äôt go to Tasmania to see the tallest sea cliffs in the southern hemisphere. I feel like it‚Äôs kinda the same thing. I went to Uluru specifically because I like nature and had a great time. Others I know who typically visit places for a more interesting history or architecture don‚Äôt like it so much
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Thanks for sharing your insights, I spent some time in the Tanami so I'm not too worried about the heat (and love the landscape/nature out that way). Uluru and Cape York are the two road trips for next year."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our country is massive and full of other sites where you can go and explore more freely though that also have those same benefits, and on top of that are also probably much easier and cheaper to get to than Uluru is. Generally, the view from the top of somewhere is more incredible than the view from the base of it too so it's not like not being able to see that view is that far-fetched of a con for ""white man."""
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes, I live in regional Australia, so the flights I've looked at have started at my nearest airport, to Brisbane, to Melbourne, then to uluru. Or to Brisbane to Cairns to uluru. If I put my airport to uluru in the virgin or qantas app it doesn't even give me results for the dates I've tried. I can get to LA in 16 hours. Brisbane then a short hop, and there are more flights. Not every place in Australia has a direct route to every place"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I ain't no geographical expert but I'm pretty sure Adelaide and Darwin are closer to Uluru than Perth
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was there a month ago. There are still free camping options if you know where to look. Download an app called ""wikicamps australia"". It shows locations of all campsites, rest spots, water tabs, showers etc all across australia. I stayed at a free campsite like 20 minutes from kata tjuta that I found through that app. I've done a whole roadtrip from cairns to alice springs and surrounding national parks and then down to adelaide and melbourne with a bunch of stops along the way while pretty much only paying for fuel that way."

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is the name of the rock. Alice Springs is a name lf a town near uluru. The name westerners gave uluru was Ayers rock
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It shouldn‚Äôt be. Pretty disrespectful to refer to Uluru as Ayers Rock apparently, I think the bloke it‚Äôs named after was a really shitty person and was horrible to the aboriginals or somethin like that.

The walk around the rock is quite impressive ~13kms if memory serves me correctly. The Olgas (Kata Tjuta) is more impressive IMO, and is worth a look."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Exactly! I'm expecting to see some TIL Alice Springs isn't near Uluru post.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Only fly to Alice Springs if you actually want to visit there. There's not anything to see on the ""road trip"" on the direct route - 470 km of nothing. Yes it's interesting to see the empty outback - for about 5 minutes - not 4+ hours of it. There is an alternate route via Kings Canyon which is a point of interest but that takes even longer - okay if you stop overnight at Kings Canyon. My suggestion is to fly in and out from AYQ, but take three days there and drive to Kata Tjuta for one of the days. Do rent a car so you're not stuck doing overpriced bus tours and you can go to and from both areas (Uluru and Kata Tjuta), as you please."

Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Primarily because Ayers Rock is a single large rock feature on an otherwise flat plain. This is why it stands out in the first place. But with nothing around it, even other geological features, it needs some sort of comparison to scale. If it was just sitting amongst a normal mountain it'd just be a hill."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is, but its indigenous name is Uluru. It holds a lot of spiritual and cultural signifigance for Aboriginal people. And slapping ol' Sir Henry Ayers name on it to make it a landmark to honour an Englishman is horribly insensitive and outdated."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes, but not at all. 11% of Australia's land mass is owned by Indigenous people, and Uluru is a great example of how that can be a great success. All the park income supports the Indigenous owners, and how it is run is decided by locals. The park rangers work for the Indigenous owners, and are learning a lot about fire management and other things. It's such a rare model, officials from all around the world visit, to see how it might be replicated in their countries.

Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I've lived in Australia my entire life, I've travelled to most of the world's continents, yet I saw the sydney harbor bridge for the first time last year and I've never been to Uluru. I suck at australia."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Isn't there! If you plan to do WA, Uluru, Barrier Reef, Sydney and Tasmania, they're all about as far away from each other as possible! Which really means lots of airplane trips, or a couple of visits."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"GBR, Lake Vic and RoG are all better than Uluru and I would argue that Mt. K is also better."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,or older people. I still say Ayers Rock half the time.
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Thats not true at all. Every aussie used to (and most still do) call it Ayers Rock until the PC police came in a few years ago. In fact I think it would be more likely to be tourists that call it that, as that's all they've known it by"
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah, when I was growing up (90s), I always heard it referred to as Ayers' Rock. Never heard the name Uluru."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Having been to uluru and walked around it and all that jazz I honestly thought it was substantially smaller than the eiffel tower
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I wouldn't have a clue how tall the Chrysler Building is. Or even *where* it is or what it looks like. Sorry, but for me at least, the Eiffel Tower is much more an internationally recognised tower. And even having been to Uluru (twice), I still wouldn't have guessed it was taller than the Eiffel Tower."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The best bit is its the tip of the iceberg so to speak. If I recall it actually connects up with Kata Tjuta under the ground
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Haha. I was the same, but caught the train on a whim from Darwin to Adelaide, taking a detour to Uluru. Totally magical thing to do."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The problem is that Uluru is so far away that it's like taking a trip to another country to get there. 3 hour flight from Sydney and another 5 hours by bus.
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I lived in Oz for 6 years and did not visit Uluru either, because it was cheaper to fly to San Francisco or LA."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To be fair, I love it when you can climb to the top of cathedrals. Another thing about Uluru is it's in the middle of a desert and it's too hot to be running and climbing and prancing about."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,PC isn't always a bad term. The rock was names Uluru long before it was named Ayer's Rock. There's no issue calling it Uluru. Don't let emotions guide your thinking.
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"That's not true at all. I, and most everyone I know, call it Uluru. Maybe old people still get it wrong, but it's always referenced as Uluru now."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A grammar nazi looking for a few points.... here's one, maybe it's time to wash all that sand out of your vagina. And Ayers Rock doesn't have the possessive apostrophe you dumb cunt....."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> And even having been to Uluru (twice), I still wouldn't have guessed it was taller than the Eiffel Tower. It's probably because there are more things around the Eiffel Tower that make it seem large by comparison. Kind of like how the moon looks bigger when close to the horizon than up in the sky."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Who's Kata Tjuta?
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"And I'm going to keep calling it that, just as this will always be Ayers Rock to me."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Also known as 'the Olgas' another large rock structure, not far from uluru"
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> hipster or leftie Correction: old people AND assholes. I grew up being taught it was Ayer's Rock, and then when the name changed I looked into why, and changed what I called it when I realised it was the right thing to do. It was called Uluru for 10,000 years by the Pitjantjatjara, and only got the name Ayer's Rock from some white dude in 1873. The only reason we don't abandon the name Ayer's Rock all together is because we're too afraid of losing the tourism dollars. People who call it Ayer's Rock are either ignorant, not good at changing habits, or just pricks."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Alright, first of all, I'm going to need you to calm right down. Not once did I say trigger, so if you could refrain from projecting some kind of 'tumblr feminazi angry bitch' persona on me, that'd be great. The reason I am standing up for the traditional name of Uluru, is because I have studied, visited and spent time with elders that would definitely have something to say about how much of a ""big deal"" it is to them. Secondly * > So, respecting the history and understanding the context of it triggers you? Two different cultures called it two different things. OMG so insensitive. There is an official name that it gets called by one group of people, and other groups of people call it something else. Common sense is an uncommon virtue. Both its proper context is not wrong. Stop being triggered by things that no one means any disrespect by. It really is not a big deal. FTFY"
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Definitely agree with you there. However in this case Uluru is basically a cathedral for the Aboriginal people. I understand why they wouldn't want it named 'rock', particularly after some dude turns up and says that he discovered it"
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,So basically you're saying that we should all speak Aboriginal dialects then? Ayers rock wasnt the only thing with an aboriginal name before the white man came. Do you even think before you speak? If you are aboriginal call it Uluru. If not then call it bloody Ayers Rock you muppet.
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Hahaha you think I need to calm down when I said this is not a big deal. I shrugged my shoulders at this debate. You clearly have a agenda and do not understand context. If I was talking to elders, I would use the name Uluru, That is common sense. If some people called it Ayers Rock, I would call it that. We are talking about a name, witch this has multiple. And in the proper context both are fine. Again it is not a big deal. Proper context Is everthing, not what the PC updated outrage book says."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Alright, there's clearly no convincing you on this one. But to make clear, context is bullshit. We're not talking Burger King in the US and Hungry Jacks in Aus here, it's a name that it shouldn't have been given in the first place, and needs to stop being used if you want to be respectful. Saying you'd use Uluru to elders is like saying you call your Mum by her name to your family and to your friends you call her whore. I mean you might, but that's not the point. There's no point being respectful if you're just going to change the next second."
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What am I censoring? I am so confused. Uluru is what they call the rock. I have no problem calling it that.
Reddit/todayilearned,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Unfortunately TEXANS_fans_SMELL there are too many of these self absorbed SJWankers in Australia. People will call it what they want and as for Ayers Rock being a cultural/spiritual/ceremonial/clown shoe site ....it's a fucking rock you dumbarse tumblr feminazi angry bitches.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I went there years ago and when we got there it was pissing down. Fantastic sight seeing the water pouring off of Uluru.

This is one of those things like the Eiffel Tower, the Pyramids etc. that you see pictures of and think ""Yeah that's huge"" but when you see it up close in person it is mind boggling. It is 348m (1,142 ft) high and 9.4kms (5.8 miles) around! This thing blew my freaking mind. Also only 10% is above ground, and it is the single largest solid piece of sandstone in the world."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru waterfalls is now on my places to visit
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I don't understand how Uluru looks like that.
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I can actually see why it was named that. I'd name that sort of pattern Uluru too.

It seemed to freak out everybody else, but I was unfazed, because I *knew* that the waterless dessert stuff is pure propaganda aimed to keep the northerners away from the riches of the continent :-)"
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I read uluru as urethra and was really disgusted by the thumbnail at first...
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Don't go to Ayers Rock ... a dingo might steal your baby.
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,As opposed to Uluru waterfalls anywhere else.
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Haha, same here. First I'm hearing of *water* being anywhere near Uluru."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'm pretty sure Uluru means ""pussy"""
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"if you hate bugs, you may want to invest in a net you can put over your face. The mozzies around Uluru, and really all around the outback are intense. Also, try kangaroo, it's awesome. Also, try kangaroo tail, it's absolutely disgusting."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just note no one in Australia has called it Ayres Rock for at least a decade or so, as it has been given back to its original owners, it should be called Uluru. If you call it Ayres Rock people might think you're being disrepectful or imperialistic - this is something many tourists aren't aware of."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just remember that Australia is HUGE, the same size as mainland USA, and Uluru is smack in the middle of the country. So if you're going make sure you plan to fly. Otherwise you'll spend a week of your time just getting there by car. Also, it changes colour throughout the day. Make sure you see it at sunrise and sunset."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It is also extremely disrespectful to climb Uluru. I did it though. Cause I can.
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So true. I just kept looking back at it when we left. And furthermore, don't just go to Uluru, visit as many places as you can in central Oz. Kata Tjuta, King's Canyon... There's so many spectacular things to experience there."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru *
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is correct
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Can't climb it, can't take pictures of it...what's next? No looking directly at it? Do not taunt Uluru?"
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is australia, if you call it Ayres rock instead of Uluru you can be sure no one will give a shit."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"That's crap - the two are used pretty much interchangeably. Please note that the (only) resort there is called [Ayer's Rock Resort](http://www.ayersrockresort.com.au), and the airport is Ayers Rock Airport."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It should be called Uluru but most people won't care if you call it something else because of all the casual racism we have.
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's been called Uluru for 22 000+ years and Ayers Rock for 140, I think one of those definitely has more weight then the other. I'm so fucking sick of Australia's constant lack of respect for our indigenous people, yes they do have problems, but they were brought on by us white fellas. They managed to live in this country for 50-70 000 years, comfortably and without having any detrimental effect on the environment, and we roll in, for 200ish years and completely fuck it all up."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is something many Australians aren't aware of also, my entire life I've heard it called Uluru and Ayers Rock interchangeably. Nobody cares, nobody finds it disrespectful, that's just one of the names that we use for it."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Oh I tried to avoid jargon. Its in any fluid mechanics book you'll find. It's called a hydraulic jump. Whenever fluid moves very rapidly its profile thins and becomes supercritical. When the flow loses enough energy, due to friction or something, it jumps to subcritical flow. This results in a great deal of energy being dissipated into the surrounding environment and causes a great deal of erosion. Engineers have to design spillways very carefully to ensure that the jump happens in an area that isn't vulnerable, if not it has enough energy to literally tear soil or weaker materials apart. I should not have worded my response the way I did, because I am not 100% sure if this is the case with Uluru, but it seems to be the most plausible explanation."

Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The airport is called Connellan Airport. And Ayers Rock Resort's proper name is Yulara, but the man is right, neither refer to the rock itself so they can be called whatever they want."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"That may be so, but the *proper* name is Uluru. People still call it Ayer's Rock because change is scary. And neither the hotel nor the airport are the sacred land in question, and are therefore quite free to continue calling themselves whatever they please."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah, they had things pretty rough. But I'm sure if I call a rock 99% of them have never seen, will never see, and have no more connection to than I do 'Uluru' instead of 'Ayer's Rock' that will make everything better, now won't it."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"i disagree. if mt. mckinley can become denali, ayer's rock can damn well become uluru. why would anyone object?"
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It's called Ayer's Rock or Uluru

Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah, It really is kind of draining after a while. I live out at Uluru, and just the sheer amount of ignorance I see shown by fellow aussies every day is mind boggling. You know its bad when overseas tourists are willing to be more culturally sensitive than people who actually live in the country."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's not shut off yet, although there are proposals to do so. The local aboriginal people strongly request visitors do not climb it, but last year [about 1 in 4 visitors did anyway](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/9630609/Climbing-Uluru-could-be-banned.html). Apparently if it falls below 1 in 5 they'll probably ban it completely."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The way this was explained to me there was: it's not that it's sacred (the concept doesn't work well with aboriginal culture), more like it's their home. So climbing on Uluru is like going to someone's home and dancing on their ancient table that's been in the family for generations even though you've been asked not to."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Probably thought it was a river. Not everyone in the world knows what Uluru is.
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Just search Uluru Australia
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For thousands of years it has been Uluru. The English discovered it and gave it a name, didn't give a fuck what it had been called for the past 40,000 years because in their eyes the people who named it had the same rights as animals.

Not only beautiful, but extremely rare! I wish I could be that lucky, but the video is great"
Reddit/megalophobia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It was still a cultural symbol back then wasn‚Äôt it? I find it simply‚Ä¶ weird and maybe somewhat lacking respect‚Ä¶ that you could climb on such an important cultural and religious landmark. I was at Uluru a couple of months back and I just wouldn‚Äôt think of climbing up there
Reddit/megalophobia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,it was a thing back then. Indigenous people had to beg for decades to get ignorant tourists like you to stop destroying their sacred land. just because it was legal once doesnt mean it was also good. Uluru was a stolen heritage sight and climbing it was a colonialist tradition. ask any Indigenous Australian and they would tell you it was never right to allow tourists to climb Uluru
Reddit/megalophobia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ignorant? As I‚Äôve already mentioned, if I was aware that it was culturally an issue I wouldn‚Äôt have climbed it. It was never mentioned to us at the time. It is what it is. I can‚Äôt unclimb it now can I? It was 40 years ago and the requests to not climb it was relatively recent. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7239093/Aboriginal-elder-no-problem-tourists-climbing-Uluru.html"
Reddit/megalophobia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We don‚Äôt disagree. It is inherently racist for colonizers to decide who is and isn‚Äôt indigenous. We know who is and isn‚Äôt indigenous because they were there before we showed up. The forced breeding of indigenous populations by colonizers through rape makes ‚Äúmuddies the waters‚Äù, but the bottom line is that you know you aren‚Äôt indigenous. So don‚Äôt try to climb Uluru. What you‚Äôre describing is common in the US. It‚Äôs called the blood quantum. It amounts to textual genocide, because in a world where indigenous people are being actively pushed into extinction through loss of territory and forced interbreeding and kids doing everything they can to leave the rez because it‚Äôs a fucking nightmare eventually nobody will have that magical 1/8 blood quantum and there will no longer legally be indigenous people. It‚Äôs hard to tell if your comment was in good faith or not, but self identification is an eminently valid means of determining who has access to the monolith that was forcibly taken from the local indigenous population. If you‚Äôre not indigenous and claim to be, there‚Äôs no trial. You‚Äôre a shitty human being. Maybe someone picks up on that and beats the shit out of you. You‚Äôre a thief, and you come from thieves, and so goes the entire history of colonization. It wouldn‚Äôt be unique. It‚Äôs unfortunate and we would hope people try not to be monsters. Your comment seemed to miss the point of the piece. That indigenous people ARE catalogued according to western conceptions of indigenousness which are wholly ignorant of tribal lines and cultural existence is bad. It‚Äôs what exists because the colonizers won."

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Also known as Uluru...
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No, looks like Uluru."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I've already been warned after posting a photo of an unusual plane at the airport and happened to have a corner of uluru in the background. There is a fee to be paid for any photos not for personal use
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Honestly, this is true. Growing up in Anangu community with some family being TOs of Uluru, it all came down to personal choice. They'd still you rather not climb it, because of their philosophical beliefs, but also due to people being ill-prepared and getting injured. Also due to the environmental impact of climbing. One of the main ones being people shitting on the Rock and it washing into the waterholes, polluting them."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A church was built by a religious institute, for a religious institute, so religious people could use it. Uluru is a rock formation that was built by millions of years of erosion, they're not really comparable in my opinion."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"With all due respect to Queen Olga, it was already called Kata Tju·πØa and didn't need naming. But yeah apparently it's actually taller than Uluru, so I'd love to go check it out one time. Take the family on a mad road trip and check out the sights."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I visited Uluru over 10 years ago. I really wanted to climb it, but didn't. I take my shoes off when I don't want to, wear long clothes in hot places, and am quiet when asked in other places of worship. I'm a dedicated atheist, so a building or a natural feature mean the same to me as far as religions go. I can be respectful and appreciate other cultures though. I agree about the land use point; we've really stuffed things up and it is going to take a lot of work to get it back to equilibrium."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is sacred because of the meaning attached to it, just like churches are sacred because of the meaning attached to it. Churches wouldn't be sacred if not for that meaning invested by people's faith, otherwise it would be like an office building or a shopping centre, just another building. Uluru is sacred because the indigenous people have that invested meaning, just as churches have that invested meaning. Being man-made or not doesn't change that."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,So a bunch of people put some rocks in a nice formation to make a church and that‚Äôs God‚Äòs will and beyond reproach. As opposed to the rainbow serpent forming Uluru and therefore nominating where the holy place is? Were there a God-and I believe there is not-the natural formation has a greater claim to be an act of a God than a bunch of people putting some bricks together. Classic first world cultural superiority complex.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Kata Tjuta covers more area then Uluru, has even more significance to the anangu people and is taller by some 100+m. Both are absolutely stunning places with the culture to boot. People that climb can make their own choice but if you do you‚Äôre an ignorant cunt that don‚Äôt seem to care about the wishes of others."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A church is exclusively built for the religion it's dedicated to. It's meaning is that it's a house of worship to the God of said religion. Uluru can't have that single, agreed upon meaning because it's not man made, it's a natural formation. People decided that an already existing thing was sacred to them, now that's fine, but it's debatable whether that means they have the authority on how they think it's should be treated."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's not about God, it's about who owns the land and to a lesser extent who built the thing in it. A church is built by actual living people. Uluru, as I said before, was built by erosion. Like, I wouldn't give Mt Sinai to some Jewish people just because it happens to be a holy site. Just because some place is a holy site isn't a good enough claim to some free land. You can acquire the land like anybody else would instead of going ""muh holy site"" > Classic first world cultural superiority complex Where do you get this from? I never claimed any culture was superior to another."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If I recall correctly, the Olgas and Ularu are part of the same rock formation, called Kata Tjuta. If we took away the sand they would be joined."

I don't know what others around the world are taught to call it these days (and it rarely comes up in conversation overseas) and understand the accidental misuse in some areas of Aus as times have changed and updates can be slow to spread, but throughout Australia (unless one is part of the backwards Hanson crowd which I'd hope no one here is) it's something that's definitely frowned down upon because based on the traditional owners (The Anangu people) for thousands and thousands of years, and in most official capacities, it's Uluru. With brackets added for reference for the benefit of older aus/internationals. May not be a super overt social rule (most people aren't especially confrontational about it), but it is definitely coded language and discouraged for a reason. Most people will gently check the other in conversation e.g. oh you mean Uluru? Yeah. Etc. Country or city. Those who still refer to an indigenous sacred site as 'Ayers Rock' (which has has been falling out of favour since the early 90's) are generally quite older/out of touch, genuinely misinformed/international or unfortunately, proudly racist. My aboriginal friends give tours here, and it's something they all view as disrespectful. Not having a go either, I share your enthusiasm and joy of knowledge, just want to spread a bit of awareness if I can for anyone who sees this and encourage others to do the same. It helps alleviate some of the burden of our first nations people, least we can do is use the correct name, no matter where we're from."

Reddit/Reverse1999,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"folks, as a new player - where can I know more about this Uluru - I haven't seen or encounter this in main mission (I'm already at Venice part)... so is this like a filler patch or something? Also, where can I find more info about Tooth Fairy? is she like ...... Semmelweis where she only appears at one of those limited time game modes?... I wish I can know more about these kind of characters - from the looks in the character pool there seems a lot of characters who are added sometime before in a patch or event but I won't be able to get to know them since they are all over..."

Reddit/Reverse1999,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Tooth Fairy was a main character in the 1.2 patch, Horror at Green Lake. The event already had it's rerun so they'll add it permanently to the game in the future. Uluru was visited in the 1.5 patch with Spathodea, Ezra, and Desert Flannel(Plus Ulu). Both 1.2 and 1.5 are side story patches, so their stories aren't permanently available."

Reddit/geography,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I spent not a small amount of time there in 2000. There were a lot of social problems. Not a great place to grow up. Intense displays of the fallout of the colonialist destruction of Aboriginal ways of life. Interesting arts and culture scene juxtaposed with blatant struggles with substance abuse and marginalization. A trek to get to Uluru and overall a humbling desertscape to be reminded of the ephemeral and minute existences we experience.

Reddit/geography,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No freaking way, Alice Springs has a globally known tourist attraction, Uluru. Needles has... Well... It's where Spike from the Peanuts lived."
Reddit/geography,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is 270km off the main highway, the turn off is 200km south of Alice. Australia is huge and empty, there's only four McDonald's between Adelaide and Darwin, that's 3000km. It's over 1200km between Port Augusta and Alice Springs there's almost nothing between the two. The furthest point to a McDonald's in the US (lower 48) is about 230km driving distance."

Reddit/geography,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Needles is closer to the Grand Canyon than Alice Springs is to Uluru. Both places have nothing in them but have things around them. I think it‚Äôs a pretty apt comparison.
Reddit/geography,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Needles has several major, globally known tourist attractions closer to it than Alice is to Uluru. The Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Hoover Dam, Los Angeles, even Disneyland (depending on traffic) are all within a 5 hour drive of Needles. That said, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time in Needles and surrounds for work, and I‚Äôll give you the point that it‚Äôs not exactly a garden spot."

For me, as a fifth generation Australian, Uluru is significant to me. Climbing it, viewing the vast landscape around it enabled me to reflect on the indigenous culture of my homeland... how they cared for and lived in the area for 10,000s of years.... I grew a greater appreciation and respect for our indigenous culture and felt connected to this land in a way I‚Äôve never been able to before. Only climbing Uluru did this for me.

Reddit/HolyShitHistory,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The sweater was only found years later, when authorities began searching for the bones of a conspiracy theorist who died around Uluru, believing it to be a hotspot of alien abduction. It was found next to the mouth of a dingo den"
Reddit/HolyShitHistory,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes, it's her, and yes, that was her age. The couple had 2 older sons before this beautiful baby girl, Azaria. This photo was just taken like this on the ginormous rock Uluru as a way to show her feet on it at that age. It was a quick snap for memories, and luckily, they did get these photos of her. You can clearly see she is very young by her tiny legs and wee face."
Reddit/HolyShitHistory,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The evidence used at the time was that there were no dingos in the area around Uluru (there absolutely were), and that they lacked the ability to carry off a small infant child. There were no drag marks found leading away from the tent, and investigators insisted a dingo wasn‚Äôt strong enough to carry a baby fully in its jaws and away from the campsite. Later tests proved that this is categorically incorrect. Dingos are strong enough to carry lambs away into the brush, animals much larger than a 2 month old child. And the police seemed so hellbent on keeping the case tidy that they were unwilling to entertain the idea that Lindy Chamberlain was telling the truth, relying on circumstantial evidence and speculation as proof she murdered her own daughter."

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Is Uluru a war memorial now? Or is it still a 600 million year old rock
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"In Europe, you can walk into/around/up/down every monolithic cathedral, some even during worship. To make this comparison is stupid. Also, Uluru is a rock - far more resilient than a human construction."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The war memorial is only meaningful because we place meaning on it. That's no different to the meaning of Uluru to Indigenous people.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,That's not even on par because we're hardly laying waste to Uluru with bulldozers and concrete.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For the Anangu people climbing over Uluru is disrespectful. For some religions, entering the temple with your shoes on is disrespectful. Or your hair uncovered. Or bare shoulders or knees. Different cultures find different things disrespectful. I don't really understand or believe in the covering the head thing, but personally, if I was lucky enough to be invited in to a synagogue to see their sacred site I'd follow their wishes and not do the thing that they'd told me was disrespectful."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Yeah but if you weren‚Äôt allowed to in those places would you respect that? There are plenty of sacred places in many different countries where you‚Äôre not allowed for various reasons. When you visit those places it‚Äôs expected to respect the wishes of the custodians so why not the same for Uluru?
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"respecting the beliefs and customs of local people is a basic tenet of ethical travel. recognising the cultural significance of a place does not detract but adds to the pleasure of visiting. most people that visit uluru also stop in at alice springs, which has the macdonnell ranges close by. miriad opportunities for climbing and walking there. you could even do the larapinta trail, 230 km long, one of australia's great walking trails. no need to climb uluru. EDIT: a word"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It seems obvious enough to me that Pope has used the Canberra war memorial as the rock that many white Australians hold sacred as a point of comparison with respecting the traditional owners views on Uluru.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's still a 1000s of years old sacred site. You can take the tour around the base, learning the history and culture of Uluru, the surrounds, the local inhabitants, how they lived on the land and their Dreamtime stories. Uluru is very impressive looking *up* at as well."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> a group will certainly still be climbing Uluru. > > Unless you're an Anangu Male, you will now be forbidden from enjoying this unique geographical feature. Got some references to that? Not that I'm doubting you, but I spent about an hour last night trying to find out whether this is a total ban, or a partial restriction with exceptions, to no luck."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Firstly, Australian Aborigines were not a single homogeneous culture. And its not true that they were stagnant for 50,000 years (nor that the only thing they invented was the ~~stick~~ boomerang). Nevertheless, I believe your conclusion is broadly correct. On the one hand we have an egalitarian point of view that says that Uluru is a symbol for **all** Australians, regardless of race, colour, sex, religion or creed, that we all have equal claim on the spirituality of the red centre and an equal right to climb the monolith and commune with the land; that even non-Australians are welcome to come and partake of this. And on the other hand we have a deeply racist and sexist point of view that says, no, it is only sacred for one tiny minority (the Anangu) out of a tiny minority of Australians; that people's access to Uluru depends on their race and sex (there are parts which are traditionally forbidden to men, and parts traditionally forbidden to women: the national park asks people not to take photos of those sections lest they are seen by the wrong sex); that only the Anangu can have a spiritual connection to the land there. We shouldn't dismiss a culture because it is old. We should dismiss it because it is elitist, racist and sexist. Yes, yes, I know that's the pot calling the kettle black. But at least we're *trying* to be less sexist and racist, not putting discrimination up on a pedestal and saying ""we've always done it this way"". If we white Europeans kept our traditional tribal beliefs, the Aboriginals would all be dead or slaves. Sometimes the right thing to do with traditional cultures is to toss them out."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A couple of things the significance of the war memorial is not what it is but what it commemorates. You could move the war manorial to another location and it would still hold its significance, the war memorial could be blown up and we would build another one and it would be just as significant. You can't do that with Uluru or ANZAC cove, and for this reason ANZAC cove has a sense of the sacred that the war memorial, for all its importance, does not."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"But the war memorial would not exist with out its cultural meaning, Uluru would, I am not trying to diminish Uluru as sacred and culturally significant I just think ANZAC cove is a better analogy."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"But what we are really talking about is respect, walking on ANZAC cove does not disrespect it the same way that walking on Uluru does, desecrating the site with say a McDonald's right there on the beach might be a better analogy."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Well... no. Just because you don't see walking on a site of significance as disrespectful doesn't mean that Indigenous people don't see walking on Uluru as disrespectful.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> For the Anangu people climbing over Uluru is disrespectful. For some religions, entering the temple with your shoes on is disrespectful. Or your hair uncovered. Or bare shoulders or knees. Different cultures find different things disrespectful. I don't really understand or believe in the covering the head thing Its a shibboleth. A meaningless gesture to enable people to distinguish between Us (the one true people) and Them (the savages and barbarians who think it is okay to eat meat on Friday, pray facing the wrong way, shave their bead but not their head, grow a bead, eat shrimp, fail to eat pancakes on Shrove Tuesday, etc.) The whole point of a shibboleth is to be: 1. Trivial and meaningless. 2. Difficult for outsiders to guess. The more difficult the better. Is it forbidden to climb Uluru, or is it everyone's duty to climb it at least once in their life? Can men climb it, or only boys? (Climb up the rock a boy, climb down a man.) Will rubbing your hand on the rock bring good luck or bad luck? Only one of Us will know for sure. Everyone else has to guess. (This should not be confused with *ritual*, which is usually [costly](http://core.ecu.edu/psyc/wuenschk/docs00/ReligRitual.htm), to weed out those who are not sufficiently committed.) The whole thing is deeply racist and sexist. (There are parts of the rock that men are not allowed to see, and parts that women are not allowed to see. The ancestors will be pissed off if their secret (wo)man's business is revealed to the other sex. If you believe that sort of shit. Ayer's Rock used to be a symbol for **all** Australians, regardless of colour, race, sex, creed or ancestry. Now one group, a tiny minority (the Anangu) of a tiny minority have a race-based elitist privilege over everyone else. Sure, its a pretty meaningless privilege in the grand scheme of things -- its not real financial, political or social power. It doesn't feed their children or prevent the Federal government's on-going war on Aboriginal tribal society. Its a meaningless gesture that really only affects a few(?) thousand tourists a year. But still, it goes against the core value (supposedly) at the heart of Australian culture: equality. And while, *in theory* at least I might work hard, smooze the right people, earn lots of money, work up the social ladder and become one of the privileged 0.1%, there is *no way in the world* I can change my ancestry and become Anangu. Even if there is some ritual I can perform to allow me to become a member of the tribe, that's conditional on me going along with the conservative ""traditional"" beliefs. As soon as I start agitating for change, for modernity, you better believe I'll be dismissed as ""not really one of us, he's done the ritual but his ancestors aren't our ancestors""."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"In what way are bridges anything like Uluru? They're structures with a purpose, they're not culturally sensitive. They were quite literally made to be travelled across."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"That's not my point. My point was that the comparison in the cartoon doesn't work because some such monuments people are allowed to climb, and so trying to make the statement that non-Aboriginal Australians are being incentive and hypocritical towards the Uluru custodians when we wouldn't want people walking on other monuments and landmarks doesn't make sense. I actually completely agree with the custodians banning people from walking on Uluru, it's entirely up to them, but drawing a parallel to attitudes about other monuments that doesn't exist is idiotic."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I'm a local person and I want to climb the Uluru. Just because there are two factions of local people doesn't mean you have to choose one over the other.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you pay what I charge, yes for sure. I would pay to climb Ayers Rock ! And I don't want to live on the rock you dipstick. I'd pay $30 fee to climb it - you can pay $30 to walk around my backyard for an hour."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,There‚Äôs no McDonald‚Äôs on Uluru. It is exactly the same as walking on Anzac cove. If you want to make that analogy that is.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> doesn't mean that Indigenous people don't see walking on Uluru as disrespectful. The Australian Aboriginal peoples are not a single homogenous group with a single culture, and Uluru is only ""sacred""^1 to a few tribes who happened to be in the area because their great-to-the-tenth ancestors killed off or interbred with whoever was there before them. Ayer's Rock was a symbol of Australia, for **all** Australians, regardless of race, colour or creed. No more. Now a tiny minority of a tiny minority have an unearned privilege over the rest of us. A symbolic one, to be sure, rather than any meaningful power or influence, but a privilege is still a privilege -- even if it is only the privilege to say ""No"". We (post-contact Australia) have certainly sinned greatly against the indigenous peoples of this continent. And continue to do so, e.g. the Intervention. Banning climbing on Uluru is a meaningless gesture that does nothing to improve Aboriginal's treatment, but panders to the worst parts of their pre-contact culture in a harmful way. I would hate for people to lose all contact with the ancient myths of their ancestors, but encouraging them to keep believing them is just a cynical way of keeping them ignorant and controllable. My ancestors believed a lot of nonsense too. Doesn't mean I have to. The bottom line is: do you believe that the rock actually was made by boys playing in the mud? If so, then you are too ignorant to have a say. And if not, then why encourage other people to believe something that you know damn well is rubbish? Why force others to treat these myths seriously? Why allow them to enforce sexist, racist and elitist superstitions on who can go to see what part of Uluru? Just because beliefs are ""traditional"" or ""spiritual"" doesn't make them good. ^1 I hate that word: whenever somebody claims that something is sacred, it is always a sign that some group is claiming unearned privilege over some other group. Whether it is scientologists, muslims, christians, or ancient religious, you know that some smug fucker is using it as an excuse to keep someone else in a position of subservience. You mustn't question me, because its sacred. You can't do that, because its secret men's business, no women allowed. Can't go there, because the gods will be pissed off. Don't ask us to pay tax, because we're doing gods work."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> What exactly do you think happened to the Aborigines when the English arrived? They all disappeared in a big poof of dust? That has absolutely nothing to do with Uluru. Your argument is analogous to somebody saying that we have to honour ""Bob's Burgers"" in Asslick Tennessee as a culturally sacred site because otherwise all those brave people in the World Trade Centre would have died for nothing. Australian aboriginals have never been a single, homogeneous group of people, and the experiences of those on the east coast at the hands of the English are not the same as those in the centre. Nor is Uluru sacred to the Aboriginal tribes of other parts of Australia, except in the modern, post-European colonial sense that Ayer's Rock is a symbol of Australia, a beautiful and awe-inspiring part of the natural landscape for **all** Australians to celebrate. We, collectively, have committed many sins against the Aboriginal people of Australia, and continue to do so. But we don't owe their religious superstitions any more respect than we owe respect to other ancient fairy tales about Zeus or Odin, and allowing one tiny group of Australians, whose membership is 100% based on genetic ancestry, privileges over the rest of us is just racism."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well, they have the legal rights to Uluru, so I guess you can avoid imposing on them your personal belief that you should be able to walk on it."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Climbing Everest from the Chinese side *was* banned until relatively recently. If the people who own the land Everest is on (Nepalese and Chinese gov't) banned climbing it then yes - organised climbs to Everest would stop. And that is what has happened here. The Anangu own the land Uluru is on and have power in dictating what people can and can't do on their property. Like you do on your land/house.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Well the Nepalese don‚Äôt like it and feel a sense of guilt for all the dead however unfortunately depend economically on climbers moreso than the custodians of Uluru.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Anangu have the title so they're the legal owners. There are conditions that it's leased back to the Commonwealth as a Nat Park, but nowhere in that are they legally required to let people climb on Uluru itself."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"According to the [Australian Government website for the Dept. of Environment and Energy](http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/national-parks/uluru-kata-tjuta-national-park): ""First declared a national park under Commonwealth law on 24 May 1977, the Australian Government handed the deeds to the park back to its Anangu traditional owners on 26 October 1985. Anangu then leased to the Director of National Parks, to be jointly managed under a board made up of a majority of traditional owners."" The Anangu are both joint-custodians and legal owners of the entirety of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"That is a very poor argument. Not climbing Uluru won't lead to death or genital mutilation. The indigenous connection to the land goes back 60 000 years, 60 000! This is 250 times longer than white people have been here. If you could comprehend this scale, you might understand why they don't want you to climb it. I can't fully understand that connection either, but I'm happy to respect the decision."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Of course if you completely remove the fact that one is a sacred spot to the oldest continual culture. I can make things that are the same be differently if i select what facts i choose on the topic. War memorial and Uluru are both scared spots to their culture. One is natural one is man made. What diff does that make
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Noone is stopping anyone from visiting. In fact, I'm sure they love when people visit and learn about their culture. They just want visitors to be respectful of their beliefs and not climb Uluru. Seems fair to me."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Then I guess it's lucky that the Anangu people don't hold Native Title over Uluru then, hey?"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No Maccas on Uluru, but there are steel poles and chains drilled into the rock - put there purely to assist people in doing exactly what the traditional owners have asked them not to."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"well sure you don't care, but a lot of people do, about the Vatican and Uluru. Shouldn't we let them have that? I don't like this idea that we should do away with religion and spirituality, it seems too much of an overreaction to the issues of religion. It has a place in this world, and gives people purpose and a moral code to build on. So long as no-ones being hurt I don't see a problem with it."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> I'm sure they love when people visit and learn about their culture. No they don't. They specifically ask that people not take photos of parts of Uluru, because of a sexist belief that some parts are only allowed to be seen by women (of their tribe), and some parts only by men. If photos of those sections are distributed, then men might see the secret women's sections, or vice versa."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What's there to respect about it? Oh, there's a beautiful, spiritual experience to be had at Uluru? We're going to keep it for ourselves, and everyone else can get fucked! Yeah, fuck that shit. I'll respect their culture when it is even a tiny bit worth respecting, instead of this ""secret men's business"" and secret women's business"" sexism and racial discrimination about who can climb the rock. Ayer's Rock was there long before the Aboriginals entered this country, it was there when we were still in the trees, and it will still be there long after we're gone. For one insignificant tribe to claim ownership of the rock is despicable. It belongs to all of mankind -- or, since national boundaries aren't going away any time soon, at least all Australians."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I didn't say I don't try not to cause offense, I said that you shouldn't limit rights based solely on offense. It's an absurd world if the majority argue for the curtailing of rights simply because someone finds something offensive. As much as I dislike George Brandis, people do have a right to be bigots, out response should be to dislike and ridicule those people, not to outlaw thoughts as some wish to. Likewise, people are allowed to be arseholes, our response shouldn't be to ban being rude. The only argument that should hold any water over Uluru is that they have some sort of limited sovereignty over the site, if that sovereignty gives them the right to stop climbs then so be it. But if this is the government changing the rules because it hurts their feelings then I'm not yet convinced the majority of Australians want that, and that instead it is simply the government making a rule because some are offended about something that isn't meant to cause offense."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">well sure you don't care, but a lot of people do, about the Vatican and Uluru. Shouldn't we let them have that? I see no reason to encourage any aspect of it where rational thought is suspended. >I don't like this idea that we should do away with religion and spirituality, it seems too much of an overreaction to the issues of religion. It has a place in this world and gives people purpose and a moral code to build on. So long as no-ones being hurt I don't see a problem with it. The problem with this is there is no reason to assume that moral code is any good. There are plenty of aspects of religion that have what most people would consider poor moral codes. I'm not suggesting that we do away with what people refer to as spirituality, just the poor thinking that goes along with it. It's perfectly possible to have spiritual feelings and experiences without having some story to explain it all. These experiences can be explained rationally, and can still be enjoyed. Nothing stops someone from feeling connected to nature or at peace or any of the rest of that. There isn't any value in having stories that are clearly mythical at best be treated as though they are credible. The thing is, people do end up getting hurt by this poor thinking. From religious hate to quack health care claims - the source of the problem is that people cannot evaluate the likelihood of something being true, in part due to accepting other unreasonable beliefs as credible."

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> So how is the Anangu simply barring tourists from climbing a sacred place that holds significant cultural importance the same? Are millions of australians negatively impacted by being unable to climb a monolith just to catch a sweet view of the landscape in your view? Ayer's Rock was a symbol for all Australians, and it is deeply, horribly racist to think that only the Anangu (or Aboriginals in general) can feel spirituality about the red centre and the Uluru monolith. What you call ""a sweet view of the landscape"" is a deep spiritual connection to the country. This land is *old*, older than we can possibly understand, and we are a tiny part of it. It is awe-inspiring, and the fact that one group of people should be able to ban that for no good reason should be an affront to all Australians. Spirituality need not be based on superstition and myth, and we should not pander to it when it is."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You‚Äôre correct. In my Dreamtime stories Uluru is the womb of our mother. This is sacred, and if you look from Birdseye you‚Äôll see Uluru lays where a woman‚Äôs womb does. This is our Ngynganatea.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Can't visit the top. Can't look out from the top of the monolith at the desert stretching out for hundreds of miles and feel what it is like. Can't engage with the full spiritual impact of being on a rock structure that has existed longer than human kind, because I'm not the right race. Spirituality is not just believing fairy tales of two brothers making Uluru from mud. But if your spirituality doesn't involve made-up fictional characters and magic, it apparently doesn't count."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Right, so when ""Australians"" vote on what to do with the site, who wins that vote every single time - the majority white people with no historical connection to the site, or the people who've been living there for thousands of years? The difference between Uluru and Stonehenge is that the people who find Uluru sacred have a continuing and unbroken tradition of living on that land. No one even knows for sure who built Stonehenge or why, so it'd be impossible to even identify the descendants of the traditional owners. The Anangu people have been living around Uluru for thousands of years before our ancestors even got here. Yeah you can find some modern hippies who think they're wizards or whatever - they don't have the history of connection to that site that the Anangu people do to Uluru."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> Accepting the denial of rights in any circumstance than leads to a question what scale, and who determines the scale There's a difference between denying rights and denying permission. It's not like the Anangu elders are denying people their *rights* to eat, sleep, live a happy life. They're not *hurting* anyone by restricting people from climbing Uluru, they're *denying permission* on the basis that the Board of Management agreed that the [Uluru climb would close once one of three preconditions, including less than 20 per cent of visitors climb and that the cultural and natural experiences on offer are the main reasons why people visit the park, had been met](https://www.environment.gov.au/mediarelease/uluru-climb-close). There's your scale."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">Both are examples of ancient cultural religious practices dictating what other human beings can and can't do on this planet. It is that simple. Yeah. But I doubt the Anangu deciding to ban climbing on their sacred place is really going to be seen as 'dictating what other human beings can and can't do on this planet.' They're not even issuing a full ban of tourists to Uluru, they're literally just saying you can't climb on it anymore. There's been a history of incidents and stupidity that have influenced them to make the decision. >Why do you believe the religion of the Anangu is somehow more deserving of respect over Christianity? Or Islam? Or Buddhism? It's not a organized religion we're talking about here, it's a spiritual aspect of their cultural traditions. There is a massive distinction between religion and spirituality. >Or is the cultural religious practice of marriage not as worthy as the worship of a big rock because it doesn't affect you as much? What? They don't literally worship Uluru at all, they just see it as a place of spiritual significance to the history of their culture and people. The issue of marriage affects me way more than not climbing on a landmark ever will."

I have better things to do than deliver empty platitudes over Facebook in an attempt to absolve myself of guilt for my inaction in any meaningful capacity. I disagree with the concept of property rights but I am supportive of the cultural and spiritual history of different people. To discount that history because you want to trample all over that particular rock is disrespectful. Land, natural formations and structures have history. If you acknowledge they have history then assuming you have something resembling morals and respect you recognise the importance of preserving that history. The great pyramids can't be climbed because of their historical significance. Uluru is no different. It's inconsequential whether they built it or not because it has been part of their culture for 60 000 years which trumps any ""but they didn't build it argument"". Do you have any objection to the clearing of old growth forests? No one built them yet they still hold important value environmentally and historically. Similarly Uluru holds important historical and spiritual value. You may disagree with the concept of religion and spirituality like I do but respect for others is more important than forcing your irreligious values on others."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I'm not saying that what you said was false. I'm saying that your factual statement was of little value or insight when some common sense is applied to it. You are minimising the significance of Uluru because there are thousands of tribes that don't regard it as sacred. Those thousands of tribes have no reason to though because they didn't live near it for thousands of years and likely didn't even know it existed. Why bother trying to minimise the significance of Uluru through a silly argument like that?

You‚Äôre correct that it‚Äôs an enormous rock, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs wrong to call it a small mountain either.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ayers Rock was officially renamed as Ayers Rock / Ulu·πüu in 1993, then the order was officially reversed to now be Ulu·πüu / Ayers Rock. So its been at over 30 years know as Uluru. I grew up knowing it as Ayers Rock, but the name change has now been around so long that my first inclination is always to call it Uluru (which I think sounds much better in any case). Fraser Island was only officially renamed K'gari in 2023. So this name change hasn't had much time to sink in and become a familiar name for most people.

Decimalisation stuck because it was a 1 way change. Metrication laws had a 10 year sunset clause and straight after, I noticed a snap back to inches and feet by some older Aussies.

Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I was given a first class all expenses paid trip to Uluru about 15 years ago and it rated very average in my opinion.
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you can not touch it or climb it because of some recently made up beliefs, why would you bother going there in the middle of no where any more? To me it seems like a group got listened to and acted upon. So what is the problem? &#x200B; > In 1973, as part of land rights discussions, the federal government recognised Paddy Uluru as the legitimate, principal owner of Uluru. Paddy Uluru was a fully initiated Anangu man familiar with all the local laws and customs. His views about tourists climbing the Rock were summed up in an interview with Erwin Chlanda of the *Alice Springs News* which quotes him saying, ‚Äúif tourists are stupid enough to climb the Rock, they‚Äôre welcome to it‚Äù and ‚Äúthe physical act of climbing was of no cultural interest‚Äù. &#x200B; [https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2018/04/banon-climbing-ayers-rock-immoral-illegal/](https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2018/04/banon-climbing-ayers-rock-immoral-illegal/)"
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Maybe my idea of ""social responsibility"" is wrong, but I feel empowering communities through dialogue and initiative to enable them to build stable economies that don't rely on the narrow streams provided by cultural and eco-tourism is more meaningful than staring at a rock. Also, fuck you NT tourism ministry for promoting that colonial view of Aboriginal Australia being Uluru and 'bloke in a red loin cloth playing his didge in the middle of Arnhem Land'."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I've never been to Uluru. Im very unAustralian.
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Okay. I raise that the NT tourism Minister has a ministerial responsibility to make sure I get paid better in NSW to afford a trip to Uluru as tourism struggles.
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'd love to visit Uluru and the NT, I want to explore the beauty of Australia before some overcrowded tourist city. But I've got milk and bread to buy so that ain't happening soon."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,They weren't allowed to close the climb until less than 20% of visitors were climbing Uluru and it was a continued downward trajectory. That means 80%+ of visitors didn't climb the rock.
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">wait, isn't Uluru tourism entirely in the hands of the indigenous? Pretty much. Uluru itself is managed by the Anagnu people, in consort with the Federal Government. But it's the Anagnu that call the shots (which is fine). Ayres Rock Resort is run by Voyages Travel. Realistically, Yulara itself is basically run by Voyages. Voyages Travel is owned by Aboriginal People, and employs a lot of Aboriginal People."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Lmao fuck me, the overall tourism of the NT is largely influenced by tourism to Ulu·πüu and other attractions like that. The racist undertones of your comment don‚Äôt even make any fucking sense because states and territories intervene all the time to prop up and advertise private tourist attractions because of the overall impact on the region. The tourism for the theme parks in Gold Coast are entirely private hands but that doesn‚Äôt mean Queensland and the city don‚Äôt advertise the shit out of it. And Uluru isn‚Äôt even a private tourist attraction as the land is leased to the Australian Government for tourist reasons and they operate in partnership with the national parks services. The indigenous owners are only entitled to 25% of tourism earnings and most of that is spent on the local community and indigenous property ownership doesn‚Äôt operate the same way as private custodianship. If you are gonna try and make a statement to justify a racist point next time can you at least ykno make sure it‚Äôs even close to an accurate analysis of the situation you clown."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What does Alice Springs have to do with Uluru?
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru* have some respect for the correct name and not Whiteman name at least
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Glasshouse Mountains will be next, then the Blue Mountains. Mount Warning and Uluru were the entree."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> Most visitors were not climbing Uluru so I don't think that's the issue. What they don't mention is that years before it was banned they were already making it extremely hard to climb. The climb was closed 90% of the time because it was too windy, too sunny, a sacred day, etc. So a huge number of people would show up thinking they could climb but not be able to."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Darwin is great. Uluru however is 2 days drive away (and another 2 back), or another return flight. To look at a lot of nothing, then a rock"
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Thats like saying gold coast is more than the theme parks then telling us all about your time on the barrier reef. There is 1500kms from Uluru to Darwin.
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,As much as I'm pro EV - we'd still be a long way off driving to Uluru being possible in an EV even if we were world-leaders in the technology.
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,> They weren't allowed to close the climb until less than 20% of visitors were climbing Uluru and it was a continued downward trajectory. That means 80%+ of visitors didn't climb the rock. So what? Does everything get closed for the same reason? Can the majority control what I choose to and where I choose to go?
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"From my recent experience at Uluru they actually employ a lot of South Sea Islanders. To be honest I didn't see many indigenous workers, there are some, but the bulk of the workers, and there are hundreds of jobs available, are from elsewhere. And those who think that you just go to Uluru Kata-Tjuka just to look at a rock are extremely ill-informed."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I even wonder how sacred some of these places are. Uluru is obvious but it opened the doors to abuse that power. Some aboriginal group here in QLD were talking about closing the glass house mountains because it was a place aboriginal women gave birth at. I don‚Äôt buy into that at all it strikes me as a complete power grab by people out to exclude others.
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ok She says come to NT Darwin is in NT Uluru figures are given.
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Definitely. The way i see all this is. Aboriginals, just like us, marvel at the wonder of striking things. Just as i look at Uluru or Glass house Mtns or the spectacular Great Ocean road area? They did too. So in their culture, they attached special meaning to the lovely places and / or held gatherings there to worship them. Great! Us? We might set up a campsite & sit and have a beer to take it all in... young dudes might want to climb it and sit on the top... its just same thing."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,There are plane loads of rich city people who fly in and only stay in the Yulara area. Do over priced activities and leave again. Not everyone who visited Uluru drives
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Only Uluru is correct, it's why there isn't the other name in small print. Get your facts right"
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">They can check the odometre at the end is all. So you can drive 150km one day, and drive 50km the next, it still falls under the 100km per day. Sure - but you'd think that in remote areas like Uluru the hire companies really should operate on a different model to make it more attractive to tourists. A model that works in the city is not appropriate in remote areas."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I think Mt Augustus isn‚Äôt strictly a monolith but it does look impressive and is much closer to capital city than Uluru. Perhaps a good alternative while climbing is allowed. (Sounds like it‚Äôs also considered sacred.)
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No you dont, Uluru has its own airport"
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Because year on year the experience and welcome were more unpleasant and the region more dangerous and lawless. Why go to Uluru when you could go to Queenstown, Bali, Magelang, or Chiang Mai where the people are pleasant and actually want you to visit their sacred sites."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When i visited Uluru, i had full intentions to climb. prior to climbing an (forgive me, im not 100% sure) Aboriginal ranger or elder gave a speech asking that we did not climb Uluru. I chose to be respectful and didn't climb. This could be part of the reason many others chose not to climb."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I loved walking around Uluru, it's really impressive when you get up close, and Kata-Tjuka as well. Nowadays they've got drone shows and many other activities to keep visitors occupied."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Also Mt Augustus has a tourist poark where people can camp within view of it. I believe this is not possible at Uluru, so therefore is not accessible to the average tourist."

Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru will always be the only correct name, the previous name is a dead name and the wrong name. It's people like you that won't get with the program of change and acceptance that are the problem with this country. Just too many bigots and racists in this country, one being yourself who thinks that it's ok to disrespect sacred land and continue disrespecting our First Nation People's.

Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I guess people used to climb Uluru in summer? I can‚Äôt imagine planning a holiday/trip anywhere inland in Australia outside of winter.
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Fun fact, it's actually not at least for the drive to Uluru! You can do the whole thing on sealed roads."

Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"How are they going to enforce the ban?

Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You physically couldn‚Äôt climb Uluru without the chain. You literally have to heave yourself up. The rock is slippery and very steep.
Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Most of my hiking has been done in mountains near Georgia/Alabama, some in Alaska, and some in Japan. So, nothing quite like Uluru, what's wrong with the chain link? It doesn't look fun, per se, but are there alternate routes up?"

Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Second time you've said this. Uluru is of extreme cultural significance to the aboriginal people, different to religion. For example, remember a few years ago when Yassmin Abdel-Magied tried to politicise Anzac Day with a tweet and half of Australia lost their fucking mind at her? That is because Anzac Day is sacred to a good many Australians. Nothing to do with religion. People are also asked not to climb as it is pretty dangerous with something like 30 people having died while attempting to climb it. Besides, even if you don't give a crap about cultural sensitivity or danger, the Anangu people own the land and the rock. If they say it is banned, then that's what it is..."

Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">You physically couldn‚Äôt climb Uluru without the chain. You physically could, people have done it before there was a chain, obviously. >You literally have to heave yourself up. The rock is slippery and very steep. Uh, yes, that's the point. It's dangerous and difficult. By popularizing it and installing a helper trail you make it a tourist spot. Lots of people who'd never dream of attempting to climb can now go up without issue. And they leave trash."
Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For you, /u/taoistturtle and /u/woody678 , even as somebody who really values the rights of indingioous people and respecting their culture and history (nearly all of my posts on reddit are about Indigenous Mexican cultures), I really disagree with this decision and I think the way you 3 are phrasing this as a black and white issue is unfair. I can appreciate the fact that the indigenous people of Australia have faced massive historical injustices, and I think it's reasonable for those people to be the owners of the land they traditionally inhabited. Hell, I wouldn't even necessarily be opposed to if Australia outright gave tons of land back to those groups and recognized them as separate sovereign nations that Australia had no authority over, complete with reparation payments. But here's the thing: As far as I can tell, the decision to not allow climbing is being made on religious grounds. I don't agree that rules or regulations should be made on the basis of religion, that one people's beliefs should dictate what people who don't have those beliefs are allowed to do. I don't think that the fact that these people have historically and still face inequality and oppression changes that: It doesn't make their religious or spiritual views any more real then anybody elses, so peopple shouldn't have to be beholden to them. Like, if their religious traditions weren't that it's bad to climb Uluru, but rather that it's bad for *women* to climb it, would you all also support a ban only for women climbers?"
Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Yes they have had a shit time. Virtue signaling isn't going to change or remedy it. Charing people $20 to climb uluru would.
Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Serious answer: I wanted to and it was open to climb. I'm a bit of a thrill seeker and I was told that it's quite the experience to tackle it. And it was. It was a tough yet very rewarding experience. The view from the top was magnificent. &#x200B; I appreciate that it can be considered disrespectful(\*) but Aboriginal elders used to climb it themselves (the white guide marks apparently trace the same route the elders took). I also don't really like the idea of someone telling me that I can't climb a completely natural feature that has been around 10000 times longer than their culture has. &#x200B; I complied with every other request to respect the culture by not taking photos in certain places, not swimming in pools, and going past certain points in all other places I saw them. But I was definitely going to climb that rock. If that makes me a dick then I'm fine with it. &#x200B; (\* My understanding is that the Aboriginal people didn't want people climbing Uluru because it's dangerous and people have died in the past. Not necessarily because of its sacredness.)"
Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"But this isn't coming out of nowhere. It's been considered disrespectful for as long as I can remember knowing about Uluru, so about thirty-five years. So, knowing that it's considered a deeply disrespectful act towards sacred ground... why would you climb it?"
Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,> it‚Äôs only a shorty drive from there. 14 hour drive from Port Augusta to Uluru according to google maps... Australians have fucked up idea of a short drive. (Though Sydney to Port Augusta looks to be 16 hours so relatively speaking it is a shorter drive to Uluru)
Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">Oh and by the way I have just claimed your house in the name of my religion so please leave it, after all it's a basic empathy test. Who do you think were the original claimants of Uluru? Tourists from Sydney? You?"
Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I realize what you're saying but I believe you may have misinterpreted my message. Of course not everyone rock climbs, and that doesn't mean they leave thrash wherever they go. The point is that making a natural site more easily accessible by all kinds of people will inevitably also attract those that have no respect for nature and leave trash. There definitely is a correlation between installed helper trails and amount of trash left behind. That doesn't mean that everyone that uses the helper trail leaves trash. And if a helper trail hadn't been installed on Uluru at any point, I'd wager it wouldn't be a garbage heap now."
Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Replying to both of your comments here. >Then we should open up all cathedrals, synagogues, mosques, temples and war memorials to climbers. When I was talking with a friend about this they brought up the same point, but I don't think it's quite comparable for logistical reasons: Cathedrals, Synagogues, mosques, etc tend to be in urban spaces where there's active infanstructure and people moving about, there's a much greater safety concern issue and it'd be generally disruptive to society as a whole. Now, if there was, say, a church built into the side of a mountain which was still used or was viewed as sacred due to some miracle said to have happened there historically; and people were denied access to mountain climb on it as a result, even if there wasn't a particularly large safety risk or risk of damage to the church itself; purely on religious respect grounds, then yes, i'd also say that's equally BS. I'm jewish, but I wouldn't demand that people not take selfies at the Wailing Wall or hell, even Auschwitz. Respect, religious value, etc are subjective things, they should not be something legislateed >If you want to explore Conner it's only possible on a private tour, because it's private property. White man's property, part of the Curtin Springs station. So how about we order the owners of Curtin Springs to get off their high horse and open Mount Conner to all comers? It's probably a much safer rock to climb, being nice and flat on top. I'm not disputing the indigenous people's claim to their land and the site, I think it's reasonable for them to have it (for the most part). My issue is their rationale: That because it's sacred to them, other people should be be beholden to their belief system, and not have access to it when there would otherwise not be a problem. I'm less saying I don't think they should be able to do it, and more that I just personally disagree with their decision, though I'd also argue that even if it's their territory, perhaps they still shouldn't be able to do it: I don't think goverments should have the ability to make policy descisions or regulations on the basis of religion, and indigenous nations or states shouldn't be immune to that. Again, you probably wouldn't defend a rule or law of theirs that gives women less rights, if such a rule existed, right? Also, something i'm a bit unclear on, and perhaps you can inform me of this, is of if uluru is still used by the indigious people for religious ceremonies: If it is, and *they* can climb it, then that's discrimination, full stop."
Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Who do you think are the current owners of Uluru? Hint: It's Australia, therefore Australian citizens own it, not some religion. By your logic America shouldn't exist since it wasn't the original claimants."
Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The local nation owns and manages it, so can tell you what to do. ""On 26 October 1985, the Governor-General of Australia returned the title deeds to the park to Anangu in a handback ceremony on the oval in Mutitjulu community. In return, Anangu leased the land to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (now Parks Australia) for 99 years. The board of management was set up in December 1985 with a majority of Anangu members, and the park continues to be jointly managed by Anangu and Parks Australia.

Reddit/DesirePath,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayers Rock is beautiful. The idea that a natural site should be off limits due to religious reasons instead of wildlife protection is silly.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It might be that there's more pandering to aboriginal interests now and people are starting to push back. Like who cares what Uluru is called but I don't see why I shouldn't climb it. Similarly the K'Gari thing might view the name change as a slippery slope.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I think a lot of it is because facebook and the internet wasn't around when they started calling Ayer's Rock by its Australian name of Uluru in 1993. So instead of being emboldened by being just being a profile picture online and saying the 'truth' like they do now, they instead just muttered it to close family and the friends that would listen."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">Why is there so much pushback from Aussies on using K'Gari, but not Uluru? Fraser Island was changed to K'gari 6 months ago. Many have not heard the name before. Uluru was changed 30 odd years ago. That's how long it takes to update old habits.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,More racist bogans go to K'Gari than Uluru
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The problem is Uluru was changed in the early 80‚Äôs. All those that bitch about the name changes weren‚Äôt born then so they grew up with it. The other side of that coin is ppl are slowly getting sick and tired of this bend the white fella over and shove it up his arse crap. Here we are striving for an free and equal society and every time they get out of bed they are made to feel guilty about something they had no control over and would not support if they did. Name changes should be optional by the individual speaking and not criticized by every mug with an opinion because the made a choice.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I still refer to Uluru as Ayers Rock. Both names are correct and reasonable to me. And im also fine if Aborigibals eant to call Fraser Is K'gari. BOTH names should be acceptable. To me its Fraser Island
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A couple of reasons in my view. 1. They haven't allowed time for the name change to sink in - Uluru was dual-named for years before switching over to primarily be Uluru. 2. It was done too fast, with too much other change such as the Voice and Welcome to Country. A great many people are over the whole thing being forced down their throats and therefore are pushing back. 3. The spelling is just silly in my opinion. ""K'gari"" is pronounced ""Gurri"" or ""Garry"". Given no Aboriginal languages had a written form, spellings should be phonetic and people should be able to correctly pronounce the name by reading the word - like Uluru for example. The ""K"" in ""K'gari"" is always silent, so why is it there."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru happened a long time ago. You can be assured that the mouthbreathers in the Facebook comment section would have had and likely do still have the same opinions on Uluru as they do on K‚Äôgari
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,There was plenty of pushback against Uluru at the time but social media didn‚Äôt exist for people to find other like minded obstinate holdouts.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Uluru switch happened a long time ago and took a, while to gain wide acceptance. I clicked on this link because I didn't know what K'Gari was, and my curiosity was piqued. I remember hearing about it a few, months ago but clearly didn't stick. Come back in twenty years and make a comparison."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru and Ayers Rock were used interchangeably for years and years. The change was simply stopping using Ayers Rock, and I'm sure there are still people that complain about it. Everyone knew where and what Uluru was, even if they called it Ayers Rock themselves. I can't speak for anyone else but the first I heard of the Fraser island/K'gari change was when it happened. Never been there, have no plans to go there, so it's not and wasn't really relevant to me."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's still Ayers Rock mate, in most non-reddit circles."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Because conservatives are crybabies and can‚Äôt handle very much at all. Which is why they accuse lefties of being the same. Edit: they cried about Uluru too
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There's a lot of fuckwits who won't use Uluru, too. But I suspect some people find K'Gari off-putting simply because they don't know how to pronounce it"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There was with Uluru mate, it was just ages ago and nobody cares anymore. At least we could all agree on how to pronounce Uluru... I dont know of anyone outside of Reddit that knows they have changed the name and I've never met anyone who knows how pronounce K'Gari... It looks like you're agreeing with your mate Gary."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Probably a bit controvial, but I think at least a part of it is it's kinda hard to pronounce. Uluru sounds like it looks, K'Gari is a little harder to know how to say it. üòÖ"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Your first mistake was reading comments on the courier mail facebook post. &#x200B; As for Slim Dusty, he's right. By either name, they mean the same place. You say Ayers Rock or Uluru to most people, and they know what you're talking about. &#x200B; And here's the thing, many Aboriginal ""names"" aren't names at all, they are descriptions of a place. For example, the description for Brisbane, Meeanjin, is literally ""place of the blue water lillies"". And given that there were over 1000 Aboriginal nations each with their own dialect, how many places of blue water lillies do you think there are, all with different names? It's the same with K'Gari, which means ""Paradise"", and I bet there are 1000 different Aboriginal words for Paradise. It could be an interesting discussion, just for the sake of it. &#x200B; In the end, does it have to be a fucking culture war? Old people eventually die, and young people who have been taught differently will dictate the common usage."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Acres Rock became Uluru over 21 years ago. Fraser Island name change less than a year ago. So Uluru is mostly accepted. Wait for time to change people's opinions
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When we changed to Uluru, it was fine. There was a few idiots but by and large, there was no sort of organised lobby to cry and whinge and snowflake about this sort of thing."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It took awhile but I now call it Uluru, usually... I get it, but realistically how many peeps actually lived around Uluru? How many tribes? Fraser Island, does it have a First Nations tribe living there? My understanding was many First nations usually lived around the coast line, for the supply of water, and only a few did inland? Happy to be corrected!! My only thought is are we putting too much emphasis on name changes to please an extremely small group of people? I'm sure First Nations living in Victoria, Nsw, Qld or Wa had 0 idea about Uluru is my point! I think the K'Gari is just coming at a time when people are asking questions around is it virtue signalling or is it making positive change. Up to each individual to answer that for themselves!"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,People still whinge about the Uluru/Ayers Rock thing too. My in-laws always call it Ayers Rock as in 'I'm Australian so should be able to climb it if I want' The island has been called K'Gari Fraser Island for several years and has only recently dropped the English language part and left the original Butchulla language name. I have no issue with this and have many family links to the area
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"People got a bit weird about Uluru back in the day. I remember being taught in school that it was Ayers Rock. Anyway, I'm cool with calling these things by their original/traditional/Aboriginal names. Don't need boring Anglo versions that are just named after people to kiss their asses"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What amuses me is that the outraged muppets can't even bothered with aboriginal names in general, only whatever thing their butterfly-like attentions latch onto at the moment. Wooloomooloo? Perfectlt fine name. Uluru... ü§Ø"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">It's been called Uluru by the general public for a long time To be clear: we're talking about a looong time. I visited Uluru in the early 80s, and it was clear about the different names (also the whole ""we'd rather you didn't climb it"" thing) 1993 the rock was officially renamed Ayers Rock / Uluru, reversed to Uluru / Ayers Rock in 2002 [(source)](https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/about/ayers-rock-or-uluru/)"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"At the time there was heaps of push back over the name change to Uluru, but over time we got over it. Like we will with K‚ÄôGari. Eventually."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You only have to look back as far as a few years back when there was major pushback from the public about people climbing on Uluru to see that people aren't open to change
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was taught Uluru at school in the 80s. It might not have been official, but it was already in our textbooks."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Pretty similar people go to Uluru though, wankers in 4WD's, grey nomads gypsying their way around the country. 4WD groups will be like ""I did the big drive [on the highway] out to Uluru!"""
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The evidence it had the same name for thousands of years is not what you think it is. Irap history is easy to change. Just look at the climbing of Uluru. It did a total 180 without our lifetime. Paddy Uluru himself said there was no rule against climbing it, that he'd been up there and it was boring, but he didn't care if anyone climbed it. Next lot of elders got some marketing advice and suddenly the history changed. You are too credulous. You probably vote greens.."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Interesting. I grew-up when the re-naming occurred, and I correct people when they say Ayers Rock. But I am OS, so being the token Aussie I get lots of questions about Uluru..."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Which actually makes a lot of sense to me. The rock is called Uluru. The nearby airport is Ayers Rock Airport, and the nearby resort is Ayers Rock Resort (interestingly, owned by an indigenous company)."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Except Ayers Rock is still its alternate name.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Yeah that's bullshit. Haven't heard anyone call it Ayers Rock in decades.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">Uluru sounds like it looks, K'Gari is a little harder to know how to say it. Exactly! No aboriginal language was written, so any spelling has been made up. Therefore, there is no need to introduce silent letters which are historical anachronisms in English. K'gari is pronounced ""Gaari"" or ""Guri"" - so why not spell it that way? People should be able to get the pronunciation correct from the spelling."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes, indigenous people still live on K‚ÄôGari and at Uluru."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I've seen a few people insisting on calling it Ayers Rock but most of these types are just interested in whatever the latest ""woke"" outrage is. Once something else comes along that they think they need to be mad about, they move onto that."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"They are, when it comes up. Any daily mail article on facebook that mentions uluru will inevitably have at least a few going ""never heard of it! Do you mean AYERS ROCK!?!?!?11?!"" etc. It's just that the majority of us have moved on from the name change and the no climbing legislation, so it doesn't come up that often."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Generational. It's still Ayers rock to people born before 1980, and we are still young and free."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Sorry, but heaps of families, international tourists and young couples visit. There's no need for 4WD vehicles because the Lasseter Highway, Yulara and roads to Uluru and Kata-Tjuka are all paved. Besides most visitors fly in. We drove, but we were in a Kia Sportage that had no 4WD capabilities. In fact, the vast majority of drivers we saw were tourists in camper vans."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Yes they do. But Ulu·πüu also has a lot of international tourist. A lot of the racist boomers who live around Ulu·πüu still persist with calling it Ayers Rock but they are now vastly outnumbered.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I wonder if those same people had a problem with the change when it happened with Uluru... But we just don't hear about it anymore because it was over 30 years ago. Hmm.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"As was the case with Uluru, name change then restrict access."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Historically names change over time, new people overcome the old and change names to suit their beliefs. This has happened since the beginning of time. I am sure the Pygmy peoples that populated the coastal land prior to aboriginal settling in those areas had names for landmarks and when they were conquered by the new comers the names were changed and so the cycle continues. However I am not saying either name is wrong what I am saying it does not matter. What matters is we get past this them and us crap and work together to create a new Australia. At this moment we are reliving the past as if it is the future. We as one nation need to get past this finger pointing and guilt complex that seems to drive the hatred between our population. Yes there is racism on both side of this argument, driven mainly by poor education and fear mongering. Through social media the young people of today have a never before opportunity to bring this nation together and force governments to interact with not just the wealthy but every person in this country from the smallest of Outback communities to the largest cities. But no, they would sooner enforce social propaganda ideals risen from partial truths and bad teaching. It has been proven time and again throughout history that when something is forced onto a populous they will rebel. Uluru is a good example of this, as mentioned it was restored to its original name in the 80‚Äôs and the name grew up with the children. However, when the rule came out preventing ppl climbing it there was no explanation, no story, so ppl rebelled. In the 80‚Äôs ABC had 5 minute animated story that spoke of the dreaming, around the time kids were sitting down to watch cartoons etc, this helped the young understand, including some of us that were not taught culture because of their parents fear. Since then even some of the aboriginal children have lost their true culture and rely on media driven catch phrase education to try and get their frustration across which in turn helps no one and fuels more hatred. The time for recompense is gone, the time for joining is now we all need each other, we see the world outside Australia falling apart and here we are bickering over the mistakes of history, we can be better than that, we are better than that."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I do. The change happened well before in was born. And I refer to to as Ayers Rock because I‚Äôm white
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have a friend who keeps calling it Ayers Rock. I ask to tell me about this Ayers (Sir Henry Ayers who was Chief Secretary of South Australia at the time William Gosse named it - yes, he named it after his boss), to the best of my knowledge Ayers never bothered to visit the rock that was named after him. My friend doesn't know who Ayers was, and he refuses to answer why we should keep the name of the guy it was named after who never took the trouble to visit."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was born before 1980. I‚Äôm happy to sing one and free and have said Uluru for nearly half my life. My mid 70s mother has told people that she is embarrassed that she climbed Uluru in her early 20s. Don‚Äôt use your age as an excuse, I‚Äôm sure there are other things in your life you have changed as you have learned more or as the world has moved on."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Yeah but what brought them around to not comment it every time Uluru is brought up in discussions?
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After 30 years there's just no point anymore? That said, when climbing ended, there were certainly some people out and about calling it Ayers Rock to try and get a rise out of people."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,He is referring to its previous name of Fraser Island. And the fact that you are being so unnecessarily difficult for a simple question really doesn't help your cause at all. Many people are not aware that Fraser Island has had a name change. Unnecessarily being a prick to people who are not aware does nothing to move K'Gari into the mainstream vocabulary like what happened when Uluru changed from Ayers Rock.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Not sure if you are special or stupid? The question was why isn't there an uptake on the name. Noone debates history that First Nations were here first, every country in the world has First Nations, it's not unique, a question was posed as to why K'Gari isn't been accepted the same as Uluru. Peeps like you hijacking a question show that it is virtue signalling, at least from you!"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Even if you felt quite strongly about it you would have to be pretty darn determined to hold onto that grudge for over 3 decades while everybody else is calling it Uluru. Words and names are determined by common usage. At some point you are just wrong about the place name.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great, let‚Äôs make sure we rename Melbourne ‚ÄòMelbin‚Äô as people have such an issue with how foreigners pronounce it. We‚Äôll rename Cairns ‚ÄòCeeins‚Äô and Uluru ‚ÄòOolooroo‚Äô, as nobody could possibly work out how to pronounce such silly names. Who cares about the actual language and people that speak it!"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For a start, Uluru is spelled phonetically, so not sure what you're on about there. And as for the others, if we were naming those places today then I would absolutely say they should be spelled phonetically. I do care for the actual language - because it's important these things are not lost. But it's a spoken language, therefore any spelling is arbitrary and should be made as simple to pronounce as possible. I really don't understand why this is a problem? What benefit does adding the silent ""K"" in ""K'gari"" bring? It's not pronounced, all it seems to do is add confusion. It seems like it was added purely to make it look more exotic."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">they are intrinsically related No they weren't, thats like saying Uluru is related to the voice referendum. And the K'Gari name change was a local government discussion, the voice was a Federal government issue."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,And Uluru/Ayres Rock
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The interesting part for me is that all things that Albo and company said the voice was not about are not supported by the written expectations of the group that worked on the Uluru Statement. its a process, and the voice is the first part. the least they can do is be honest about it."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Honestly, that is a rubbish argument. It was fair and reasonable for Dutton to ask more questions from the PM to deliver a bipartisan support. Albanese never answered these questions. Now we determine that the Uluru Statement is part of a larger document that calls for treaties, compensation, sovereignty and that it is in fact a third chamber of parliament. It looks slimy when Albo says that he will implement it in full, then pretends that it is a simple one pager, then attempts to distance himself from the rest of the document. Conceptually I support a Voice, but this looks poor."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"As a No voter, the lack of details is the least of why I'm voting no. Who tf is saying the Uluru Statement is too long? And I assure you, I'm very serious about this. To claim no voters are racist, don't know the 'real' details, or just aren't 'serious people' is insulting and frankly boring. Grow up."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The Uluru statement is not the voice. Nice strawman though. Both are true.
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,[Article](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/09/indigenous-australians-agency-refutes-jacinta-prices-claim-that-uluru-statement-is-26-pages?CMP=share_btn_tw) [Uluru statement](https://ulurustatement.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/UluruStatementfromtheHeartPLAINTEXT.pdf)
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The claim is actual misinformation. The Uluru Statement itself is a single page. There are 25 other pages of supplemental information about the backgrounds and excerpts of regional dialogues that informed it that are attached to the Uluru Statement but they're just that: supplemental. Hell even Chris Kenny, another Sky News anchor, called the claim false."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The 23 pager isn't the Uluru statement. It's a document from the conference (that's been online since 2017). When the Uluru statement was given to the government (under Morrison) it was a one page document signed on bark and delivered to parliament. Given Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull repeatedly described it as a one page statement while they were PM it's a bit weird that those who oppose it also called it a one page document until peta credlin ""discovered"" a public document that is something the PM has never referenced as agreeing to. Also shockingly if the voice happens, it doesn't mean treaty. If the voice starts up and immediately demands reperations the parliament decides on that, and if we don't like it when whoever is in starts trying to agree to them we can vote them out. Also Dutton's questions did get answered. The voice model isn't in the constitution and is up to parliament. Albo indicated it'd be in like with the Langton report broadly (regional voices feeding into a national one, which would be 24 people elected). Just because Dutton keeps saying the questions weren't answered doesnt mean they weren't. If you don't know, find out..."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,No they aren't... The Uluru statement is a single A4 page document.
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So, you need less details on the Uluru statement and more details on the voice. Seems like all you are looking for is reasons to muddy the waters."
Reddit/australian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I don't know, I reckon when indigenous people produced the Uluru Statement, they asked for a voice and didn't ask for a housing policy. You could read it, it's one page long. The government is in fact doing many other things while the voice referendum is going on, so you could choose to focus on those, if you liked."

This our ancestors did, according to the reckoning of our culture, from the Creation, according to the common law from ‚Äòtime immemorial‚Äô, and according to science more than 60,000 years ago. >This sovereignty is a spiritual notion: the ancestral tie between the land, or ‚Äòmother nature‚Äô, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who were born therefrom, remain attached thereto, and must one day return thither to be united with our ancestors. This link is the basis of the ownership of the soil, or better, of sovereignty. It has never been ceded or extinguished, and co-exists with the sovereignty of the Crown. >How could it be otherwise? That peoples possessed a land for sixty millennia and this sacred link disappears from world history in merely the last two hundred years? >With substantive constitutional change and structural reform, we believe this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia‚Äôs nationhood. >Proportionally, we are the most incarcerated people on the planet. We are not an innately criminal people. Our children are aliened from their families at unprecedented rates. This cannot be because we have no love for them. And our youth languish in detention in obscene numbers. They should be our hope for the future. >These dimensions of our crisis tell plainly the structural nature of our problem. This is the torment of our powerlessness. >We seek constitutional reforms to empower our people and take a rightful place in our own country. When we have power over our destiny our children will flourish. They will walk in two worlds and their culture will be a gift to their country. >We call for the establishment of a First Nations Voice enshrined in the Constitution. >Makarrata is the culmination of our agenda: the coming together after a struggle. It captures our aspirations for a fair and truthful relationship with the people of Australia and a better future for our children based on justice and self-determination. >We seek a Makarrata Commission to supervise a process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations and truth-telling about our history. >In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we seek to be heard.

This is a blatant *Ministry of Truth* style retelling of history. It is a complete and utter lie, and anyone involved closely in the debate knows it, and the fact that the only active supporters of the voice left are the ones that are willing to toe the line to the point of point-blank lying should be enough to spell death for this referendum. The yes camp has shown nothing but contempt for the average Australian, the broader public is not that stupid, no amount of ""fact checks"" or propaganda in our national broadcaster can hope to convince people over the cold-hard fact that there is ample video footage of the Uluru statement's architects saying that it is in fact, more than one page."

It's carried by the amount of yes supporting commenters on here who were never not going to vote yes but are going on about how the no side has devolved into lies. This article is an excellent example. The formal Uluru statement is one page but there are 25 pages of what you might call an appendix.

Find me a photograph that shows all so-called ""26 pages"". It doesn't exist. The only thing that was signed was 1 page. Again, not quite. The signatures you see were signed onto a border piece that a reprint of the first page of the statement was stuck onto, that is the signatories signed a blank page. The photo you are looking at is a reproduction of the reprint that signatures were added to post-hoc. Unlike the Declaration of Independence, the Uluru Statement wasn't handwritten, it was typed by Davis et. Al on a computer somewhere *before* the Uluru Dialoge. That aside, simply claiming signatures make it original is a poor argument as is claiming that a photograph of something makes that something original (aside from the fact that not all the first page of the statement *is original*). *As an aside* - In your link to the ""photo"" - was an article on a speech made my Davis that day. Oddly at 1h10m of that speech Davis claims that Climate Change was a prominent theme during the dialogues.

There's been a lot of confusion and perhaps even gaslighting over its length, with claims that it's just a one-pager and claims that it is multiple. In truth, while the Uluru Statement itself may be one page, there are several supplementary pages associated with it. Megan Davis, the author, has consistently highlighted the consultative nature of the process and acknowledged these multiple pages on various occasions. However, she has also emphasized that the Uluru Statement is singularly one page, especially when addressing concerns about the supporting documents that were a part of the consultation.

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The Uluru Statement is not other issues. What is Albo trying to hide .
Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Is she the only person that has any authority over the statement? What have others said? Did she simply misspeak (like shes said)? The focus on a few comments over several years while ignoring the entire other context showing without a doubt the Uluru statement is simply the one page document titled ""The Uluru Statement""."
Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Nice try, but you haven't explained why the statement being one page long when downloaded from the Uluru Statement website is somehow trumped by the **background information** in the Final Report. The statement is one page long, the background information is not."
Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">Hundreds? No not hundreds but I can read. I read in 2018 when Davis said Yes, there are hundreds of pages of supporting documents. And again, I ask you to use basic comprehension to look at the documents and figure out what she meant. Uluru is one. The others are not the statement itself. But I know reading facts gets in the way of your lies."
Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">What in the proposed amendment will mean Indigenlhs people have a specific extra legal right? Link it and explain how Indigenous people will have more rights than anyone else. Because as far as I can tell all it does is create an advisory body. Easy. All citizens can vote and make representations to their local member for parliament. The voice allows an additional ""representation"" to parliament (it doesn't say advice) that can affect all laws and policies - but only for a certain race - regardless of individual circumstances. Parliament and the high court determine the powers of the voice, you and I aren't constitutional scholars so we can't understand the full implications. You will have kids of millionaire aboriginals such as Buddy Frankline, Adam Goodes, Warren Mundine etc who have additional rights based not on need, but only because they were born into the ""correct"" race - that's fundamentally racist. Further, look at the ""extended"" version of the Uluru statement from the ""heart"". There is nothing in there about closing the gap, improving health outcomes or employment for aboriginal Australians - it's all about money, separatism, land rights, power, reparations and revenge. It's not ""statement from the heart"", but hatred from the heart.

In relation to process, these questions included whether a Treaty should be negotiated first as a national framework agreement under which regional and local treaties are made. In relation to content, the Dialogues discussed that **a Treaty could include** a proper say in decision-making, the establishment of a truth commission, **reparations, a financial settlement (such as seeking a percentage of GDP)**, the resolution of land, water and resources issues, **recognition of authority and customary law**, and guarantees of respect for the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples.

No, these must all be make believe. **You** are dodging the question. Why is it that those 18-20 pages **are not** included when you download the Uluru Statement from their website?

When Davis says >The Uluru Statement ‚Ä¶ is occasionally mistaken as merely a one-page document How should basic comprehension interpret this?"
Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's ironic, isn't it? This entire process around the Uluru Statement is pitched as a journey of ""healing"" and ""truth-telling"". Yet, when someone seeks clarity or raises questions, they're sidelined, treated as misinformed, or even accused of spreading disinformation. Moreover, it seems the 'Yes' campaign strategically avoids certain topics, likely because they're unpopular, and not due to any perceived ""poisoning of the well."" Why are some truths or perspectives seemingly more valid than others? If we're genuinely committed to reconciliation and understanding, then let's have a full, open conversation. Otherwise, let's stop pretending this is about truth at all. Personally, I think 'The Voice' is a bad idea because it is vague, a special privilege that no other person living in Australia will ever receive (no matter their circumstance) and would be too hard to remove if it turns into a shamble and frankly I think it will turn into a bureaucratic waste of money that won't do anything to achieve its aims and just become another ATSIC, only this time constitutionally enshrined. I don't care about how many pages a document is. I care about 'The Voice' and the values and goals that went into its creation and there's a whole lot of context there that Yes-campaigners don't want to touch with a ten-foot pole for a reason. I don't need to poison any wells or muddy any waters. The yes-campaigners are doing a good job of that themselves. 'The Voice' is going to torpedo any chance of constitutional recognition for indigenous people for decades."

Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,On a serious note: little to no erosion in the desert. Uluru looks pretty identical.
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Officially it is dual named Ayers Rock and Uluru. Source: http://www.ntlis.nt.gov.au/placenames/view.jsp?id=10532
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No, but to many people it was Ayers Rock. Things can have two names in different languages, even if (!) one is colonial. If a lot of people call something a name, that is the name they use. That's how language works. There isn't a big ledger in the sky of Official Traditional Names You Must Use Or It Doesn't Count, especially not for natural features no one built. If people prefer to use Uluru out of respect for the Pitjantjatjara people, and the Australian government declares that the name for official purposes, that's great but doesn't change this fact. I suppose Australia is a ""wrong"" name too? Or ""Alexander the Great"", ""Simon Peter"", ""Julius Caesar"", etc. the way we usually pronounce them? Or the Chinese rendering of many Western names? No, they're just the traditional names for them in another language, even if they never even heard those names themselves in their lives."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Except, well, it was. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluru#Name From 1873 to 1993, it was official Ayers Rock. It then became Ayers Rock/Uluru until 2003, when it become Ulura/Ayers Rock. What is disgraceful, however, is that they plan to close it to climbers from next year. It's a national monument perfectly suited to climbing, and should remain open."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"im not buying the colonial apologist stuff. that's not ""how language works"". it was uluru for thousands of years, it takes a supreme amount of arrogance to say ""nah, now this is named after me""."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,give up what? i can call an apple a table but that doesn't make it so. it just makes you seem uninformed/ignorant. same with uluru.
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'm not a colonial apologist, the Aborigines suffered centuries of evil bullshit. But that's not what I am saying. It is of course named Uluru too. But language is about what *people* use. Lots of people call it Ayers' Rock too, even if you don't like it or think they should. I call it China, not Zhongguo. Both are valid names even if one is more ""original"". And so on. China is simply a foreign name for it. That isn't arrogance. But to say it has never been called China is ignorance of what language is about. Or at least failure to define your terms out of indignance."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">it was uluru for thousands of years Unlikely. Languages, particularly languages used by cultures who have yet to invent writing typically mutate over time. Whatever it was even just one thousand years ago is unlikely to have been ""Uluru"""
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"By the way, do you have evidence it has been called that for thousands of years? You do realise that there are about 20 Aboriginal Australian language families, and the Pama-Nyungan family which includes the Western Desert languages like Pintjantjara has undergone language change and replacement and migration just like all language families on earth? Uluru is of course a good name for it - which I prefer to use - but getting all prescriptive and saying it hasn't been called anything else makes no sense."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I think the bigger issue is that it is now common knowledge that referring to Uluru as Ayer's Rock is seen as incredibly disrespectful. It's an unconscious extension of the Terra Nullius mindset\-\- that nobody of importance did anything that mattered here before the British arrived. Uluru is a sacred place to Indigenous Australians in the area and, regardless of how long or how widely it was used, it had a name already. We've trashed and trampled the site itself, the least we can do is show a bit of humility when referring to it. Edit: not trying to start anything, I largely agree with what you've said above and below. Just seems like you're defending something that doesn't warrant defending, and that you don't even do."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I wasn't that interested in going, but my gf wanted to go so we did. I absolutely loved the place - very glad I went. Make sure you have enough time to go to Kata Tjuta while you're there too. If you've got the time to make the trip, go to Kings Canyon too - about a 4 hour drive away, but the walk there is probably one of the best I've ever done."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Can't comment on the resort, but I visited Uluru about 15 years ago and loved it. I wasn't really all that interested initially but I made friends with an international student who was keen to visit so I decided to tag along. Its incomprehensibly big and I was overawed by the size of it as we approached in the tour bus. I didn't realise how big it was. I didn't climb out of respect for the requests by the Traditional Custodians but walked (or cycled? Can't quite remember) around the base and it was amazing. It's like 8kms in circumference. The tour visited at sunrise and sunset too and it looks completely at different times of the day. Totally recommend but I imagine you'd also want to do other things in the area too as Uluru itself is probably just a full day activity kind of thing."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I went in Feb 2020 just before COVID hit. It was one of the best experiences of my life. I spent 4 days there, visiting both Uluru and Kata Tju·πØa. It‚Äôs amazing watching the colours change in the rock during sunrise and sunset, and I really recommend the guided walk around the base- it‚Äôs a long walk, but I learned so much about the significance of the rock and stories of the different features. Also the indigenous exhibit near the rock is great too. The resort is expensive- I stayed in a cabin in the caravan park with a couple of friends. It was relatively inexpensive and had everything we needed including a little kitchen. I don‚Äôt know about now, but one thing that surprised me was that the prices in the little supermarket for food were not outrageous at the time- just a bit more than Sydney prices. I reckon 3-4 days is enough to see everything and enjoy it."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I‚Äôm on my way home from Uluru. It was a deeply profound experience.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you're on a budget there is cheaper accommodation at Curtin Springs Station. It's about 80km from Uluru (towards Alice Springs) and is a working cattle station. There is free camping at Curtin Springs Station or air conditioned backpacker accommodation rooms. There is fuel and a bar also. A great view of Mt Conner can be seen from the outdoor dining area. It takes less than an hour to drive to Uluru. Uluru will take your breath away. It is just spectacular, no photographs have ever done it justice."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I accidentally punched myself in the face near Uluru, whilst trying to swat a fly. I would not recommend. Err, I don't recommend punching yourself in the face . Uluru is great, and I recommend a photography tour if you are into that sort of thing."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"As far as the resort goes,there are different types of accommodation, from tents to 5 stars, all in the same complex. Uluru is spectacular, walk around the base, it is beautiful. Most definitely worth it."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I Found Kings Canyon far more enjoyable than uluru but cycling around the rock early in the morning was a really nice way to see it.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is AMAZING. I dreamed of going for a long time and ended doing a road trip for my long service break. Uluru was all I dreamed of and more. Some considerations if you go: - Yulara Resort precinct is heavily sanitized for tourism despite the cultural and spiritual magnificence of the place - Visit the Cultural Centre in the Park to hear from Anangu people the stories of Uluru and surrounding areas - Some places around Uluru and surrounding areas have gender specific cultural protocols which should be respected - there is a camp ground in the resort precinct - buy a park pass for entry into the Nat Park - there is a petrol station, IGA, post office, etc in the town centre of Yulara - sunset viewing areas of Uluru get crazy busy, instead visit at sunrise when it is quiet as To sit and be in the presence of Uluru inspires a sense of humility and quietness - a feeling that still fills me with wonder nearly twelve months later."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Unless you're doing a day trip from Alice, which I don't recommend (it's 4 hours in each direction) you kinda have to stay at the resort or camp in the campground. There are several levels of accommodation from hostel to ritzy so you do have some choices. It's absolutely worth seeing. I recommend seeing Uluru at sunrise, walking around the rock with a guide, also the Field of Lights, and walking through Kata Tjuta. You can also visit the local art centre at Mutitjulu."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Not fun, but majestic. The full walk around the base is very doable and I think it'd be quite special doing it solo. You could go to the free guided ranger talk in the morning (which gives you some Anangu context) and then walk the rest of the way on your own or join with whoever else is there. At night you see more stars than you've ever seen. Definitely go to Kata Tjuta too. The resort is very average, especially for that price (it's like a 3 star motel at 5 star prices) but Uluru itself is so worthwhile. I'm not normally a spiritual person nor particularly outdoorsy but it really moved me."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I went there over 40 years ago when you could camp right at Uluru. Before Yulara resort was built. It's very, very impressive. Great at dawn and dusk. Really enjoyed the walk through Katatjuta too."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a large rock, a large red rock, an amazing, mind numbingly large red rock, at the right angle it can look like a big red wave heading straight for you. From the air it looks like an arrowhead, pointing at Mutitjulu. I have seen people burst into tears when they sight the rock on the flight in, it can evoke that kind of reaction. It is also damn hot during the day, and freezing at night. You will need a park pass to get in, the pass is for 3 days and will cost you $38 (at time of writing)."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"stay at the campground, it‚Äôs reasonably priced. but yes you should go. it‚Äôs an incredible place. visit kata tjuta too"
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I loved Uluru when I went there. Did the Kings Canyon hike, camel ride around Uluru, went for a tour around Uluru, 5 star dinner at Kata Tjuta, did the Kata Tjuta hike, swagged it at Uluru and went star gazing. Got to see some dingos, snakes an lots weird insects."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Fun is subjective. It doesn't have a waterslide but if you enjoy looking at interesting geological formations then you'll probably like looking at Uluru.

Uluru is literally just one big resort, not a town like you're imagining. If you have a car then Definitely kings canyon and/or keep going to Alice Springs."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Repeating many comments here... 'fun' isn't the word I would use to describe Ayers Rock. It's expensive. It's interesting. Some might even say Euphoric depending on whether you get off on natural sights... You might enjoy it as you would enjoy a walk... But it's not thrill a minute, adrenaline pumping fun in the same way looking at the Grand Canyon is impressive, but it isn't 'fun'."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Kings Canyon is my most favourite walk ever, it's amazing. Also did Kata Tjuta (recommend the full walk, a lot of people turned around and went back before descending into the valley but that bit was beautiful too, felt like I'd gone back in time), enjoyed that more than the Uluru base walk (though that was great too)."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Seconded. Do a sunrise camel tour as well, and maybe grab a chopper for a tourist trip too. If the sky is clear, do the Sounds of Silence dinner too. Mereenie Loop from Alice to Uluru via Kings Canyon and back through ""the corner"" is an awesome trip."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I'd definitely want to hear the stories of Uluru. I get excited when learning about different cultures - it expands not only my mind but my whole being.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you're the type of person who climbed it, I don't think you truly get Uluru."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I second your recommendations - I went to Uluru, Kings Canyon and Kata Tjuta nearly 25 years ago and I don't think I'll ever forget these places - absolutely amazing. My favourite bit was hearing the Dreamtime stories of the area."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yeah, honestly, I was way better than I expected, as I said. I did a three day tour from Alice, visiting Kata Tjuta and Kings Canyon, and possibly somewhere else (ling time ago now!). I went in winter and it was warm in the day and cold at night, and we swagged in the open air in the desert. Really awesome. I'm sure something similar would operate from the Uluru area too.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes, Uluru is a monolith and the Olgas are... part of the same ancient formation, iirc (I'm not a geologist) and there's another massive rock some km away whose name escapes me - I think you drive past it on the eastern way to Uluru, though. As a proud sandgroper, though, the largest rock in the world is in Western Australia, Mt Augustus. It's just not isolated in the middle of a flat plain and looming over everything like Uluru is so is considered less spectacular. But apparently it's bigger."

Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I did a base walk around it about 6 months ago. Our tour guide has been doing trips around Uluru for about 15 years and gave us all a talk about the choice to climb it, or not, the night before we headed there. First on the list of reasons not to climb it, is that it's a sacred place to the Aboriginal people who own it and have been living there for over 20 thousand years. 20 thousand years. People climb up it and find they need to piss, because it's a long ass climb, and they have no choice but to piss on the most sacred part of the place, which then gets into the waterfalls etc around it. Secondly, any time someone gets hurt or dies doing it, the Aboriginal landowners enter a period of mourning, as they feel responsible for the safety of everyone who visits. It can last weeks or more and usually involves them hitting themselves on the head with a rock until they bleed as part of the tradition. So if that's not reason enough, there's also the fact that a bunch of people have died doing it or been otherwise injured. That and really, the climb isn't what it's about - the view from the top is pretty much just empty desert. The really interesting stuff is on the ground at the different important sites around it, the waterfalls, paintings, etc. Thankfully they're closing the climb this year I believe, and I'm glad they are."

Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"While i do agree with you in this case, regarding Uluru and not climbing it - Respecting other people's opinion and modifying your behaviour because of it, are two different things. Some people are offended by EVERYTHING, and if everyone had to modify their behaviour to placate the most easily-offended of us, we'd be back to the dark ages."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What is there to see? Desert stretching into the distance, and Kata Tjuta in the distance? There are far better views to be had in Australia."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Aboriginal landowners have been living at Uluru for tens of thousands of years. Is it too much to ask that people respect their beliefs and not climb it? I agree, some people are offended by everything, but this is a site of incredible importance, a World Heritage site as well."
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Aboriginals didn't build Uluru.
Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I still agree with you about not climbing Uluru. However, i have issues with your ideas about not offending people. To draw a parallel reference to current events: Many christians find the idea of abortion GROSSLY offensive. Should abortion therefore be banned for everyone? Where is the line drawn?"

I don't know if you're aware, but there are very few places that are listed as World Heritage for both cultural and natural reasons - Uluru is one of them. If that isn't enough significance for you, then I guess you could give a shit about the beliefs of the people who lived there for so long. Also, ""backwards superstitions"", how ignorant can you be. I'm an atheist but their beliefs are their own and I'll respect them, just as I'd expect say a devout Christian to respect my beliefs and not try and tell me how to live. That and they're not hogging it either, they don't climb it. In fact they welcome people to come and learn about their culture there, which clearly you didn't."

Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well it's akin to walking into the [Kaaba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba) in Islamic culture. It's considered a very sacred place and entry is reserved only for a very small set of people and only during significant ceremonies. Aboriginal elders very rarely climbed the rock and even then it was only during parts of key cultural ceremonies. I don't know how offensive they find it, but they're just asking people to respect their very, very, long-held beliefs. And really, the view from the top pales in significance to the sites around the base, the climb isn't what makes the place so special.

The idea has always been that the appointees will have the life experience to advice on what is good policy. Given the thorough appointee process, I'd suggest the representatives will understand their constituency. The proposed mandate is simply to advise on indigenous policy and other policy (such as rural/ farming practises etc) that has a disproportionate impact on First Nations people. It's an advisory body that has no power to supercede parliament. They're not supplanting any of that process."

The one page statement from the heart does nothing of the sort. >The idea has always been that the appointees will have the life experience to advice on what is good policy.

If they are nominated instead of elected the political behaviours will be the same. >The idea has always been that the appointees will have the life experience to advice on what is good policy. That might be the *idea* but ultimately politicking, particularly when advice impacts funding allocation between localities will ultimately become corrupted. >The proposed mandate is simply to advise on indigenous policy and other policy (such as rural/ farming practises etc This isnt wholly true, the constitutional amendment allows representation to *both* the executive and parliment without.

Now that there are so many varieties with dwarf genetics out there though hopefully we start to get varieties with superior yields and disease resistance to go along with the exciting shapes, colours and great flavors."

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Is climbing Mount Warning eroding it as much as climbing was eroding Ayers Rock ?.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I remember a time where I was given a chance to climb it and I refused. Uluru is sacred and it's an infinite beauty that's best left alone. I remember reading when the news proclaimed they'd finally ban anyone from climbing it and there was such a massive increase in people venturing there to do it. I thought it was so offensive, but a good amount of them didn't give a damn. I agreed with the elders that those who climbed it should be stricken down by bad luck. But Uluru is something else when compared to Wollumbin, I do believe that information displays should be put in specific areas to help educate people about it."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"She's not wrong. Uluru I can kinda understand that a big rock in the middle of nothing might be some bad juju, but a mountain peak amongst other mountains would be a vantage point for seeing all sorts of stuff."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It is not. Mt warning is made of seriously hard rock while uluru is basically a pile of sand. It's also much easier to reinforce/maintain the walking track.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One of the issues for Uluru was lack of public facilities. Of course you can't have toilets on top of Uluru, but people were using it as one as well as leaving their rubbish up there too. If it ever rained, then all that would go into the few precious watering holes at the base where there's a rare species of shrimp. Might not be as big of an issue for Wollumbin but it'd still be bad if people are doing the same thing and disrespecting/damaging the environment."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was a guide at Uluru for a year and one day after some rain there was a used pad stuck to the side of the rock about 20 metres up. You see that and wonder just how much rubbish must've been washed off the rock into the waterholes over the years. It was also closed for safety. I'm all for having dangerous places signposted but still accessible, but in Uluru's case I suppose they just got sick of having to rescue people who tried to get down some other way. Plus, so many tourists would head up there for a few hours in the middle of the day with the 300ml water bottle they got on the plane, and by the time they're back on the ground they look like they're going to collapse from heat exhaustion."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Except religious bodies have places and sites you're not meant to enter all the time. And educational resources are a mediocre and insubstantial measure, particularly when the dominant culture tends to treat the minority culture with contempt. A quarter of a million people climbed Uluru every year, after years of 'educational materials', getting injured, leaving human waste, rubbish, and generally acting like a sacred site was for a fun afternoon stroll rather than something that had profound relevance for the group that's lived there for tens of thousands of years of faith. And it's a slippery slope because you're insinuating that this specific measure is going to result down to nothing being left. Which is nonsense."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"At least from where i'm sitting the difference is i don't think the government should get involved in it in the first place. but im not really the person making that decision. I might not be inclined to climb it if i was asked not to, but i don't think the law should be used to stop people doing it. I think there's a bit of a grey area in this because i have the same opinion about Uluru - i think people should be allowed to climb it if it's treated with respect, and the local indigenous people should be able to ask people not to do it in the first place - out of respect. My idea of respecting it is to not throw shit around on top of it or dump garbage everywhere. But i might still want to see the view from the top. For the local indigenous people, walking on top of it *is* disrespecting it. If humans died out in a thousand years and theres no story to associate it with it anymore, it'd just be a big rock and nobody would be around to care. So who's right? People always just draw the line below what they would do. Either way, It seems like the law is a bit of a blunt instrument when it comes to this kind of thing."

Obviously if you already have bookings then a night may not be an option, but just something to consider. They used to serve camel burgers then too - don't know if they still do - presumably made from their own camels. The way we did it was we spent the night at Erldunda Roadhouse, then ""commuted"" to Yulara early morning for our walk around Uluru, then went to Kings Creek Station for the night. No nights in Yulara due to prices being too high for our taste. What's a 250 km commute in the Outback between friends ;) If you're planning to do the walk, make sure you start early. We started early enough that it felt cool, but by the time we were done we realised we didn't bring quite enough water and I got a pretty nasty headache. It got hot surprisingly fast. ""In a few months"" might mean middle of summer, so even more so then (we went in October)."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Thanks mate, tis the closest I will get to it. Uluru has been in my dreams since was about 12 years old. Never had the chance to go though, although my whole body wanted to something always in the way. Now I am 62 and struggle to walk around my 2 acres."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I remember going to Alice Springs as a kid, it was really interesting. We saw a book with photos of Uluru in a variety of different conditions, which made me think it must've taken years to amass such a collection. On the last day we were there, it unseasonably pissed down with rain. So we drove around the great rock and all I could think was how lucky I was to see it in one of the situations from the book, with my own eyes. It's probably my earliest memory that I'd describe as a landmark of my own mind - no pun intended. It's as vivid now as it ever has been."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was lucky enough to be at Uluru a couple of years ago when it rained pretty heavily for a day, very much like these pics walking around the base. Eerie, otherworldly and beautiful. And how about those tiny frogs that just hibernate in the sand, sometimes for a year, until it rains enough to fill the waterholes."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I found a little frog in a puddle yesterday, across the road from Uluru. The noise from his friends was very noticeable near the waterhole."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is sacred to the indigenous people and should never be climbed.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,No it's not. Uluru is a sacred place and it is 100% disrespectful to climb it.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The area around Uluru has historically had a lot of vegetation, even up til the early 1900s."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You can also see the rock paintings closely. There are some areas of Uluru that are very sacred and cannot be photographed. You are allowed to see them though.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If in a Muslim country, yes. The Anangu people have been the traditional custodians of Uluru for at least 35,000 years. It is culturally insensitive and very offensive to climb a site so important to their history. If you don't want to accept that, best you stay away."
Reddit/Monopoly_GO,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"December 24th. Need Mount Uluru, PLEAAAZZEEE:) https://preview.redd.it/boy3bv330uyb1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f4c31da9ed09391bfc6de9e22921e486c3d57ff"
Reddit/Monopoly_GO,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I have wedding bells to give! And need Mount uluru to complete my set! Birthday guess is‚Ä¶ July 14th
Reddit/backpacking,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is on my bucket list! Since it is only a 26 hour drive away I always figure I have plenty of time to do it.
Reddit/backpacking,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Oh my god, Uluru is absolutely stunning!! I‚Äôll never forget the sunset I saw there"
Reddit/backpacking,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We climbed Uluru back in 1988. It‚Äôs an amazing place.
Reddit/backpacking,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I‚Äôm not good on scientific stuff so here‚Äôs a link to an article on how the rock was formed if that helps - https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2017-06-27/how-did-uluru-and-kata-tjuta-form/8572068 Uluru rock is a sacred part of aboriginal culture, it used to be their land and living space and believe their ancestors spirits live on in the rock. As the rock has become a tourist attraction the new owners of the land let people climb the rock however the aboriginal people see it as very disrespectful as it‚Äôs sacred land to them. From October this year they are stopping people from climbing the rock out of respect to the aboriginal people which is good! I‚Äôm not an expert but just sharing what I learnt when I was there :)"
Reddit/backpacking,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So I‚Äôve actually just finished my road trip in Australia where we did over 28,000km and drove around the entire coast line. We ducked down into the middle to do Uluru which was about a 4 day drive from Cairns (with no service and just cows for company). Stopped in Alice Springs for a day then went out and did Uluru, Kata Tjuta and Kings Canyon in 3 days. It‚Äôs not difficult to get to as it‚Äôs just straight roads with nothing around, just time and petrol consuming!!"
Reddit/backpacking,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Not OP but I traveled through Australia a few years ago and made my way to see Uluru. I was with a group and we started in Adelaide... took a 26 hour train (not as bad as it sounds) and ended up in Alice Springs. We went with a tour guide who drove us out there. We stopped at a few beautiful places before getting to Uluru so it took us a few days from what I remember. We slept in swags out in the outback under the stars which was an amazing experience. Definitely recommend and getting a tour guide was a great idea too. He brought us to a lot of neat places (canyons, rivers, beautiful hiking spots and so much more) and we learned a lot and got to see/do more than we would‚Äôve without a guide to guide us."
Reddit/AITAH,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru now.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,>Uluru climb closed ~~permanently~~ indefinitely as hundreds scale sacred site on final day
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The whole National Park is just wonderful, Uluru is amazing, Kata tjuta is incredible (criminally underrated). When I climbed the rock the view from up there honestly made me appreciate the landscape, and respect the aboriginals more (just thinking about how skillful they were to live in such a seemingly baron environment). Anyway that's how I felt, they might have shot themselves in the foot by closing the climb in terms of tourism but only time will tell :))"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,100s rush to Uluru for the last oppprtunity to be disrespectful wankers.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Paraphrasing someone on Triple J yesterday: 'I respect indigenous people, but they need to respect my right to climb Uluru' Some serious cognitive dissonance going on there."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'm amazed at the number of people saying ""well that took away any reason I had of going."" From what I've heard Uluru is amazing to just walk around and take it all in, absolutely no need to climb it to get a sense of how special it is. I loved reading [Iva Davies'](https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/iva-davies-great-southern-land/news-story/2f8ea9efd2d23c3efdcb2423f0151bcd?sv=284dff56c4b859c9d4053b4a2c3c7e72) description of his time at Uluru. Funny how reading it back now he said it would've felt disrespectful and wrong to just bring an acoustic guitar there yet you have people crying they can't climb the fucking thing"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Or lightning. https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/discover/nature/seasons/
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"They changed the 'official' name from Ayers Rock back to Uluru, and that's when things went downhill for the big rock."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You can actually see the rock from a totally different perspective from the top. Here is [one shot I found from a search](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/uluru-northern-territory-australia-aug-600w-1510548749.jpg) but as you climb you get to see a whole bunch of different angles which really shows the true size of the rock. From the ground it looks kind of 2d. I also remember there being a tree at end of the walk.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"They set a target where if less than 20% of people going to Uluru climbed it, they said they would stop the climb. Both of these things have now happened. So, <20% of people that were going there (and how many were actually going there to scale it or did it because they were there anyway?)..."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I think equating climbing Ayers Rock to white supremacy is a bit extreme It may be disrespectful but it's not white supremacy.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It's called Uluru. Ayers Rock is a shit name.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You raise an interesting point. Indigenous peoples throughout Australia relate to sites, landscape features, waterways, ocean, sky, plants and animals in a very different way to non-indigenous people. You seem to associate higher cultural values with the built environment than natural features. Conversely indigenous people see the built environment as ephemeral and less relevent than the country and especially features like Uluru that have persisted in their stories and their environment for many millenia. Think about some of humanities most iconic and ancient built structures, like the pyramids that are probably less than 5000 years old and how much heritage human cultures have and continue to associate with those structures. Now imagine you consider yourself a disciple (for want of a better word) of the land and a structure like Uluru has been a place of reverence for your people for at least 10,000 years and perhaps over 50,000 years and your culture has passed down knowledge/stories associated with that 'rock' for hundreds of generations. We don't relate to the natural environment like indigenous people but just because we don't understand or relate to their culture and connection to country doesn't mean we can't respect and admire it for how rare and important their culture is to human history and culture more broadly."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It's called either Uluru or Ayers Rock.
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You're really trying to make the argument that calling it Ayers Rock is white supremacy? Wow....
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Why not just call it Uluru? It's what the indigenous people called it before white people came. How would you like it if another race invaded your home land, took hundreds of years to apologize and knew the name of something that was sacred to you but chose to call it something shit like ""Ayers Rock"""
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It doesn't matter what it was called before Europeans arrived here, I can use both Uluru or Ayers Rock when referring to the massive rock in the middle of Australia. I don't have anything against calling it Uluru, but both names can be used and I just happen to use Ayers Rock since that's what I've grown up calling it."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's a natural wonder that shouldn't belong to anyone, same as the Great Barrier Reef, Grand Canyon, Mount Everest etc It shouldn't be a case of who saw it first, someone shouldn't be born with an inherent right over Uluru to the next person, this is the same principal as our beaches not being privately owned, there is a public interest in everyone having equal access to that natural beauty."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"White supremacy doesn't have to be an overt belief system where you're running around at rallies with tiki torches, it can just be as simple as climbing Uluru after you've planned an entire holiday around the deadline because you think you're entitled to ignore traditional beliefs or your individual rights and experiences matter more than theirs on their own land. Why don't you pull your head in. It's Indigenous peoples land. You can't just go and do whatever the fuck you want on other peoples land without being called out for that."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Unbelievable.... since when has being logical and apply reason been so frowned upon?? There are all sorts of sacred sites people visit and walk on, the pyramids, Stonehenge etc etc What now? Do the individual indigenous communities get to shut down access to other random areas around AUS that they consider ""sacred""? There are thousands of these sites, Uluru is just the most salient. What a load of shit..."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"But that's not what I said, at all I only suggested that equating climbing Uluru to the actions of the KKK or Nazis is a little OTT, please don't put words in my mouth"
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We manage our common goods (natural wonders) so they can be maintained and enjoyed over time by the most people. Some sites have not only natural values but also cultural values. We place rules and limits so as to maintain a sites natural and cultural values for 'everyone'. We regulate how people interact with the Great Barrier Reef by limiting tourist charters and commercial fising to protect its natural values, just like we are now regulating how tourist interact with Uluru to protect the cultural and natural values of this site."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"People don't walk on Stonehenge, they walk around it. Same as Uluru now. ""What now? Do the individual indigenous communities get to shut down access to other random areas around AUS that they consider ""sacred""?"" No."
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"HAHAHA says who? You? No offence but your opinion counts for sweet fuck all. Pretty sure there are still Pagan communities who still worship the multiple Henge's and consider them sacred, bit on the nose for you to come out and call it a Dead society don't you think? Maybe a little bit privileged? Not very woke of you. I mean, not touching them flies sure,but the Pyramids actively encourage INTERNAL tours?? I don't see the point of difference, aside from the fact that they are not a naturally formed geological feature with cultural values placed on it in a relatively truncated timescale. Ill be the first one laughing when they reopen the stupid climb anyway once the tourist dollar dies in the arse, Ive been to Alice, and to Uluru, its a shithole and that rock is the only thing attracting people there."
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"R5: My city built Machu Picchu on the sacred wonder of Uluru, rather than the other mountain. Also Uluru didn't count as a mountain in game, but that didn't stop the builders I guess. *üéµüéµI'm gonna rock down to the Machu Uluruüéµüéµ*"

Reddit/EarthPorn,West MacDonnell Ormiston,Alice Springs is my home town.....so many places like this. Ormiston Gorge and Ellery Big Hole were amongst my favorites.
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,West MacDonnell Ormiston,"We lived in Alice Springs for six years and Darwin for ten years, so of course we are rather fond of the Northern Territory. And while I think the West MacDonnell's are one of the best 100 km you can do in the country, I reluctantly agree with the others that - on a fairly short trip - four nights for the Big Three is enough (Kings Canyon, Uluru, and Kata Tjuta). If this gives you six nights in Sydney rather than four, then it's a sacrifice worth making. Make sure you don't waste those Sydney days - tourist trinkets like HOHO buses and harbour tours are totally unnecessary, as is the bridge climb in my view, but I've not done it. So your five full days in The Emerald City can cover: * Manly Beach by ferry and Taronga Zoo (on the same day, via Balmoral Beach) * Watsons Bay Ferry, Bondi Beach, Coastal Walk to Coogee, Bondi Junction * Blue Mountains day-trip (cheap train from Central to Katoomba about 7:00 AM) * Old Sydney and Queer Sydney (Domain, NSWAG, Museum, Taylor Square, Kings Cross) * I would try to fit in Pyrmont, Glebe, Balmain, Paddington, Surry Hills, and Newtown as well * The Rocks, Barangaroo, Darling Harbour, Maritime Museum, Chinatown, Pitt Street Mall That's a pretty good program. Public transport is excellent - so I recommend you use it."
Reddit/australia,West MacDonnell Ormiston,West Macdonnell (sic?) ranges are so beautiful.
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,West MacDonnell Ormiston,"Jetstar is having a sale on flights into Yulara at the moment, so it's a good time to grab a bargain. You can fold some tourist activities (like Field of Lights) into your accommodation costs when you book into the resort, or you can book it separately if you're camping. AAT Kings do bus tours to Kata Tjuta, Kings Canyon, and along the West Macs. None of this is cheap though. Late May is usually a good time to come, warm days with cool nights."
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,West MacDonnell Ormiston,"There‚Äôs some really amazing hiking and views through the West MacDonnell ranges, enjoy"
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,West MacDonnell Ormiston,"Some comments and questions: * For me, Cairns (Port Douglas) is a *much* better Great Barrier Reef land base than the Whitsundays * More to see and do, the Reef is closer, and flights are much better * Fly UK > Singapore / BKK / KUL > Cairns, then Cairns > Gold Coast (OOL) You have the time to rent a vehicle in Alice Springs, and drive: * Namatjira Drive to Glen Helen (West MacDonnell's) and return - 2D * Drive to Kings Canyon (Watarrka NP) - 2D * Drive to Yulara (Uluru and Kata Tjuta) - 3D * Drive back to Kulgera, and take the road south to Adelaide (Coober Pedy, Flinders) * Adelaide wine regions, and it's a nice city You either drop the car and take a plane, train, or bus to Melbourne, or you drive the vehicle over two days on the straight highway, or 3-4 days via the GOR. Note that the world's best football code is called ""NRL"" or ""League"" ... ""Rugby"" generally means Rugby Union (played by pansies and toffs) - except among Melbourne people who are woefully ignorant about both games. üôÉ"
Reddit/AustraliaTravel,West MacDonnell Ormiston,"Hey guys, posted an updated itinerary.. just incase any of you lovely peeps were following lol... Planning a mad month itinerary for Oz in May 2025. I‚Äôve gone into a lot of detail, I am just very excited! Our fixed dates are a family wedding and hopefully the State of Origin game, and we hope that the other highlights will be Barrier Reef and some time in the Outback. We are two persons for the full trip, my partner and I (30s & 40s) are reasonable fitness, like to keep busy, but also won‚Äôt be on the go at 8am every morning! We are both fine with hiking, snorkelling, like to take a lot of pictures and visit the odd museum, experiencing a bit of culture. My mum (70s) will join us for the first week in Cairns. She is also active, but given her age won‚Äôt want to be running around knackering herself out! I‚Äôd love feedback on the itinerary, specifically the following: o Cairns area: Where do you think to stay for 3rd-4th-5th? ***I have heard that Cairns and Port Douglas are good bases, but I think they are too much like resorts for our taste? ***My partner is interested in staying on Fitzroy island? But I think that would be too much of a faff to get to and from rainforest etc? One idea is to stay the first two nights on Fitzroy and then transfer to Cairns island? ***I like the idea of experience of experiencing a unique place like Cape Tribulation but I don‚Äôt know if it is too isolated for a couple of nights? ***Are we better to fly from Gold Coast / Brisbane to Alice Springs and then hire van to drive South or vice versa? oWhat do you think about the Outback section?

Reddit/AustraliaTravel,West MacDonnell Ormiston,"They're going all that way, and want to experience some outback. They shouldn't miss the Alice Springs Desert Park, the West MacDonnell's and Kings Canyon ... all very good. And Coober Pedy / Flinders Ranges are pretty out-there as well. Renting a van one-way might be a challenge - but a Toyota Hiace style van should be possible."
Reddit/OutdoorAus,West MacDonnell Ormiston,"I‚Äôve been 3 times over the years. I found camping to be safe and easy. Sunsets on the rock are easy, just drive, take your dinner and some drinks. You can self walk around the base and see some caves etc. Personally the real magic in in the west macdonnell ranges."
Reddit/UltralightAus,West MacDonnell Ormiston,"I reckon Larapinta is heaps better than Jatbula anyway. You can definitely have a relaxing experience on Larapinta, some of the sections aren‚Äôt too hard. If I had six days and wanted to go easier I‚Äôd probably go from Ellery Creek and hike around to camp at Ellery North then continue on to Ormiston Gorge. There‚Äôs some climbs and scrambles through that section but nothing too bad and you can have short days to split it up. Honestly when I went I camped alone at Ellery North, Serpentine Gorge and then a random creek bed in section 9. Then only two others at Hermits Hideaway. The ends of the trail and road accessible sites that have public camping for cars are busy (like Ormiston Gorge). But at Ormiston you camp away from the cars, though it still felt sort of busy. High camps are usually less busy, but they can also be less available space so you have to hedge your bets."
