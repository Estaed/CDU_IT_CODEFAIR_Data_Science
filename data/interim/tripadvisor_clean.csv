TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"By which I mean 1) The Uluru base walk. Difficult to get the full perspective when you are up this close, but still magical to walk around it and although there are plenty of information plaques, it is worth doing it with a guide who can explain some of the dream time stories at the various points of interest as you go round. 2) The Sunset viewing platform. Spectacular and it doesn’t actually matter how many other people are watching it with you, it’s still magical. And one of the few attractions when you should constantly take pictures as the camera lens will detect the subtle changes in the colour of the rock better than the human eye. 3) The sunrise from the Kata Tjuta sunrise viewing platform. Yes, you see the sun rise behind Uluru but to be honest the colour changes of Kata Tjutu are probably even more impressive."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a special place which stands out brilliantly against the blue sky. We spent a day in the national park, visiting Uluru and Kata Tjuta formations and the visitor center. It's especially interesting how the formations look so different depending on your viewing angle."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Incredible experience, beautiful scenery, beautiful people - did the Mala walk with James which was just awesome and James is so knowledgeable ! Definitely recommend .."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I did the 4 days Uluru tour with Lost in Australia. It was a very unique experience. Our tour guide Chloe did an amazing job. We did really nice hikes and campfires and Chloe explained a lot about the Aborigine culture. The meals were great and it was possible to eat vegetarian or vegan if requested. Sleeping in the swags was a challenge for me but it was great to try it - a real adventure. Plus the group was so welcoming and friendly! Thank you very much!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visiting Uluṟu is a must for every Australian. However we were disappointed in having to purchase a 3 day pass when we were only there for one day. The cultural centre is staffed by people from overseas, we would have liked to see the Indigenous Australians working there."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I did the 3 Day Adventure with Lost in Australia. The best trip I’ve done in Australia! Super well organised tour with pick up and drop off at plenty locations. The tour guides were really lovely and funny and ensured a good group spirit. Especially the evenings at the campfire and the sleeping under the stars made it a really unique experience.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Lost In Australia 7 Day Alice Springs to Darwin Ultimate Tour was an unforgettable adventure! My favourite tour out of many I’ve done. Every day was packed with breathtaking sights, from the iconic Uluru and Kings Canyon to the lush waterfalls of Kakadu and Litchfield. The guides Phoebe and Jason were knowledgeable, friendly, and made the trip fun and engaging. Camping under the stars and connecting with fellow travelers added to the experience. The itinerary was perfectly balanced with activities, cultural insights, and downtime. It’s the best way to see the heart of Australia’s Outback and Top End in one epic journey. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking true Aussie adventure!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Lost ins Australia 3 Day and 3 night tour was absolutely fabulous! I highly recommend flying in and out of Yulara if you want to avoid long bus rides but I personally enjoyed them with nice stops to see Emus. Winter is also perfect to sleep in the swags and gaze at the night sky. Ther will be less animals and better temperatures for the lovely Kings Canyon hike anyways and the sleeping bags are warm enough. Food, spirits and the Tour Guide Ryan were outstandig and I would do this tour again! The sunrise walk around Uluru is one of my favorite Australian memories :)"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"5 day trip to Uluru and around the outback This was my first trip to the Australian outback and it was amazing and makes me look forward to more! I covered two national parks during this trip: Uluru-Kata Kjuta and Watarrka. There are 3 primary sites: - Uluru - Ayer’s rock - Kata Tjuṯa - Kings Canyon My favourite was the King’s Canyon. And if there was limited time, I would recco to do just that one! Each of these are walks, with different terrain and views. Each of these sites can be done via a tour service or yourself. The tours are either during sunrise or sunset, on an avg cos ~$200 per head. If going by yourself, you need to rent a car or atleast in Uluru/ Kata Kjuta, you can take a hop on-hop off bus. Am not sure abt the public transport option at King’s since we had a car. Besides these 3 sites, there are 2 art installations at Uluru and a camel farm with some farm animals that can be seen for free and a 45 minute camel ride that needs to be booked in advance. All tours and tickets can be booked the tourist centre in the resort. Park tickets have to be purchased additionally, which can only be done online. Uluru +KK park ticket is $38pp valid for 3 days ( extendable) ane King’s is $10 pp. The weather was amazing early June- avg temperature between 9 am to 5 pm was 16-17 degrees C, a light jacket was enough. Before and after, it was closer to 12-13. It was sunny through the day. Will share details of the accommodation post the itinerary below. Here’s what we did: ( 2 of us) Day 1: Landed in the afternoon, relaxed and went for the Drone show during sunset. It included unlimited wine and a cheese platter, which was good enough as dinner! The sunset was beautiful, while the drone show was ok. Some information was shared about the aboriginal people and their history but it was nothing different from the info available at the tourist centre and while the effort of putting up the installation was commendable, the show was quite plaid. Tour lasted 90 minutes. Day 2: Camel farm ( self) in the day and and Field of lights show after sunset. we chose the one without wine and canapés. It’s a set of 90,000 hand made lights on display. They take you there at night and the whole effect is great. But again, the info shared was boring and limited to how many lights were used, who made it and for how long has it been open. Amongst the drone show and this one, I’d say this was better. Day 3: we booked the hop on - hop off bus to Uluru ($49pp) and took the Sunrise pick up at 6.05 am. The coach takes you to a sunrise viewing area after which it drops you off to the start of a walk around Ayer’s rock.There are several walks across each site- you can either cover a full round or can do shorter walks. We started with the intention of starting at the Mala walk and completing the whole round but we were kinda bored after 2 hours and took the bus to go to the cultural centre instead. There was an awesome presentation by a senior aboriginal lady, supported by an English speaking gentleman and truly provided some insights about the people and their lives. The cafe at the centre was nice too and they served coffee and some rolls, wraps and pies. The sunrise was the highlight and I would certainly recco it. The walk was very easy- flat, on red sand, very quiet and also easily accessible by wheelchair. The Sunset can be viewed at the Sunset viewing point or even at a look around area near the resort. Day 4: We rented a car from the Ayer’s rock airport ( because all tours were full)and drove to Kata Kjuta. We did the full rim walk which took us a little under 3 hours at an easy pace. The views were astounding. The walk had pebbled paths and also involved climbing over the big rocks of Kata Tjuṯa. Post the walk, we drove to the Sunset viewing point closeby and then got back to the resort. Just a 30-35 minute drive. Day 5: we checked out and left at around 8 am for Kings canyon. We stopped for some food and rest and started the rim walk a little before 1 pm (else the drive takes not more than 3 hours) and took 2 hours and 40 mins. The walk, the views, the experience was just brilliant. You walk over several rocks which cannot be seen from the outside. You’d never guess what ur in for, till you get to the inside of the canyon. There were very few ppl along this trail, as all tours are only during sunrise and sunset. We ended the walk and then went over near the Discovery resort’s Lurkita lookout to see the sunset, with some drinks. There is also a light towers experience ( a light installation) but we didn’t choose that. There are also day and overnight tours available for King’s canyon from Uluru. Next day, we left at 9.30 am, stopped at King’s creek station to have breakfast (Amazing!!) and fuel up and drove back to the Ayer’s rock airport. Kings canyon was not part of our itinerary at first and this place was recommended by some folks who we met at Uluru. Am sooo glad they did! There is also an airport near King’s canyon. Accommodation: Ayer’s rock - only has one resort called the Ayer’s rock resort which comprises 4 hotels- Outback, Sails in the Desert, Emu walk apartments and The Lost Camel. Outback has a hotel and lodge/ dorm option. The others had only rooms. The outback dorm costs 60$ pp and had 4 beds ie 2 bunk beds. Very clean and comfy. Common bathrooms and showers for everyone including the lodge rooms. Outback had a bar, a fast food kiosk, a restaurant and a live band, a communal kitchen with bbq et al. From the looks of it, all the hotel rooms across the 4 seemed pretty basic, only the size of rooms changed. We thought Outback was most lively, we went around to try food at each restaurant across the resort. Staff everywhere were great. Kings canyon: we booked a room with Discovery. Clean room, had a TV, fridge, double bed and kettle. Common bathroom and showers, communal kitchen. Some tips: - Book in advance - tours, hop-on-hop-off buses get booked and have limited slots. So the earlier you book, better it is. The tourist centre shuts at 5 pm at Ayers. For Kings canyon, can book at the resort. - Face net for flies - there are LOADS of flies and they stick to ur face and body. It’s a task to keep them away and hike and not lose ur balance! Lots of people had purchased face nets to keep the flies away. - Car rental- we found that car rental is cheaper online than at the rental shops in the resort. FYI, we found that cars charge you a rental for a limited mileage, any additional mileage used beyond that is charged a fee. Eg we paid 220 a day for rental, had to return the car with a full tank and had to pay a fee of 25c per Km over 200 kms driven. Plus some location fee of 37$ + GST. Total car rental with fuel and excess etc for 48 hours cost us $740 - Super markets- The Ayer’s rock super market opens 9 am to 8 pm. Kings canyon is from 7 am- 7 pm. Both do not have alcohol. Stuff is 30-40% more expensive than in the city - Drinking Water is available to refill at resorts but tastes different. - Food: at Ayer’s, all the hotels have restaurants. There is hot roast chicken available at the supermarket too. And some pre packed salads, besides fresh fruits, veggies, cheese, yogurt, marinated meats, cookies, cup noodles, snacks. You can borrow a set of cutlery and cooking pots/knives from the reception ( atleast at Outback hotel) and cook it at the communal kitchen. At King’s, there is a sole restaurant that serves food and drinks. The store has some sandwiches, cup noodles, fruits and cheese. - Alcohol: only available at bars and restaurants, not in the super market. Outback hotel has a bottle shop from where you can buy alcohol ( wines, beers and hard liquor) - If you want to cover all 3 sites, the trip can be done in 3-4 days if you just make sure you book the tours in advance or have a car"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a beautiful experience. We did several hikes while we were here and they did not disappoint. My favorite thing was watching the sunset for both rocks on different nights. There are also vsrious tours and experiences to be had here. We did a star gazing tour and a camel tour. Both reccomended. The cultural center is very educational and my kids loved the area that was specifically created with children in mind. Additionally, the bathrooms are very clean and well maintained. Highly recommend this once in a lifetime experience!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had rented a Camper Van. By Day 3, we knew a powered site was needed. Campervans require sealed roads, and our next location was the Ayer’s Rock Resort at Yulura. This is a 5.5 hour drive from Ormiston Gorge , unless you have 4WD capability, and even that requires the Merinee Pass to be opened. Refuelling in Alice Springs, we made a brief stop at the Art Gallery, before driving to Ayers’ Rock Resort (ARR) in time for Sunset. The sheer size of the rock is very impressive, and truly changes colour as the sun sets. ARR was our home for two nights and the powered site made a huge difference to our comfort. The facilities are first class, with Showers, laundry, bin bay and swimming pool. A shuttle bus service connects the campground to the three hotels in the complex, as to the Shopping village. Day 4 was taking on the Rock Base walk, which meant a 12.5 km hike around Uluru itself. If you show up at 10 AM, a local ranger will give a guided tour for the first 1.5 km or so, which is well worth it. The hike path is completely flat, but even so, you need to pack water for the journey. The rock does take on various ‘faces’ as you circumnavigate it, and once back in the carpark, it is wise to visit the Cultural Centre and café to rest the feet. Around 5 PM, cars and tour buses gather at two viewing sites within the Uluru National Park itself, which gives you a much closer sunset experience with the rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"An amazing national park, with so much to see! It covers the two ancient rock formations, Uluru and Kata Tjuta, and everything around and in between them. Places you should not miss: - Uluru at sunrise/ sunset - the place is just majestic in its beauty, - Kata Tjuta - there are several walks you can take there, Valley of the Winds was my favourite. - Kantju Gorge - preferably at sunset when it glows an intense red, - The cultural centre - a place to fully explore art/ handicraft and history of the Anangu people. Plan your adventures for early morning/ late afternoon, otherwise it gets scorchingly hot."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Camping at Uluru with Lost In Australia was an unforgettable experience. The team was always available and supportive, even when unexpected situations arose, making us feel safe and well taken care of throughout the trip. Sleeping under the stars, surrounded by the incredible beauty of nature, was simply magical. Every moment felt authentic and deeply connected to the land. One of the highlights was exploring the breathtaking Kings canyon — a truly emotional and awe-inspiring part of the journey. I highly recommend this experience to anyone looking for a genuine adventure in Australia’s outback!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My partner and I chose Lost in Australia to visit the Red Centre, and we did well! The organization was impeccable, we were taken care of from A to Z, everything went very smoothly. The activities were interesting and varied, and we also had free time to relax in the pool. The best when it's hot in the afternoon. Our guide was very friendly and what's more, he was a great cook! We had a great time, and the portions were more than generous. In short, we spent 4 incredible days, between breathtaking landscapes, culture and hiking :) We highly recommend this tour to discover Uluru!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was my second visit to Uluru, but the first time bringing my family—and it was an unforgettable experience. The sunrise and sunset viewing platforms are absolutely worth it. Just make sure to arrive at least 20 minutes early, as they tend to fill up quickly. One of the highlights for us was the free guided (Mala) walking tour, which we followed with the full base walk around Uluru. The path is flat and easy, and our 10-year-old managed it without any trouble. If you’re a runner, you’ll also spot a few others out early in the morning when the weather is cooler—a great time to enjoy the serenity of the area."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just finished the 4-day Uluru camping tour with Lost in Australia and it was absolutely incredible! We explored the iconic Uluru, the majestic domes of Kata Tjuta, and hiked through the breathtaking Kings Canyon. Camping in swags under the stars was such a unique and unforgettable experience—simple but magical. The food exceeded expectations—fresh, hearty, and way better than your usual camp meals. Big shoutout to our guide, Troy, who brought great energy, deep knowledge, and a good sense of humor that kept us all engaged. The group dynamic was amazing—everyone was friendly, fun, and up for adventure. Lost in Australia nailed the logistics, the vibes, and the overall experience. If you’re looking for an authentic way to experience the Red Centre with awesome people, beautiful landscapes, and a real connection to country, this is it. One of the best trips I’ve done in Australia!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It was everything we hoped for. A truly magical place and glad that the Indiginous tribes can share its beauty with everyone and that it is a place to be respected
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The views are amazing nice place love u Uluru. Nice weather and travel across the park very beautiful 😍 scene see you soon.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We were in Yulara for 3 full days. We had a rental car and did the sunset and sunrise visits to the park. While I had not heard as much about Kata Tjuṯa it’s as impressive as Uluru. Do take the time to visit the cultural centre to learn about the history of the indigenous people. We learned a lot when we attended the daily presentation at the cultural centre. The Mala walk with a park ranger was also very informative. At the cultural centre you can see local artists and buy beautiful paintings at Walkatjara gallery (in my opinion more options than at the gallery in Yulara). We don’t buy much when we travel but we are taking home a beautiful dot painting. There’s also a small cafe and shop with purchases supporting the local community. I wish the hotels at Yulara did more to promote the cultural centre, after all visitors are there for the park."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Sunset viewing: Tips: - Go 45mn/1h prior to the sunset time as it gets pretty crowded. This way you choose your spot to park the car and have the best view. - Bring your flynets for flies (you can buy them anywhere in the Yulara shops or even your hotel reception). - If it is cloudy you won't see much of the ""colour changes"" or it being red, as the sun won't reflect on the rock. We didn't see it, but during the day it was perfect anyway! I loved Uluru."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Unquestionably a must do experience. Researching the weather might be a good idea though because at over 43 degrees celsius it was toasty even first thing in the morning or just before sunset. Incredible history and culture. The colours of the rock as the light changes are magnificent.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We did the sunrise tour which was fine but the real joy was walking around Uluru. The watering holes were stunning. Seeing the cave paintings up close was amazing. The appearance of the rock is so different close up.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was my 5th trip to the rock, my wife's 3rd, our friends 2nd and his wife's 1st. It was lovely seeing the reactions on their faces. My friend hadn't been for 45years and his wife was mesmerized This is a special place, spiritual for aboriginal peoples and you can feel it too. The immense size of the single rock is awesome. You need to see a sunset at least, the changes it goes through are beautiful. We found the sunrise not as good. We also walked one of the tracks around the base in a rainy drizzle which wasn't too bad as it was cooler and no flies. Apparently 2 weeks after we left they had the record rainfall ever. The waterfalls would have been something to see."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Mum and I came here last year and are both so glad that we did. Uluru is something that every Australian MUST see at least once in their lifetime. We did the 10 kilometre base walk around Uluru. If you are planning on doing the base walk, it is important that you go either early morning at sunrise or sunset, it is not safe to do it in the middle of the day as it gets extremely hot and there is no shade. Also make sure you pack plenty of water and Gatorade as well as wear appropriate clothing (information on appropriate clothing in “Tips”) to avoid dehydration, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. When we arrived at Uluru, I was at a loss for words, the rock is huge and just feels so magical. They say the rock changes colour throughout the day and I can confirm that is 100% true, I could see Uluru as we entered the park by the bus and it looked purple but by the time we actually arrived at the rock it was bright orange. Uluru There are certain parts of Uluru that you cannot photograph, these places are clearly marked with signs asking that you not take photographs, this is around the north - east face of Uluru. The reason for this is that the rock details and features at these sites are equivalent to sacred scripture for the Anangu - they describe culturally important information that should only be viewed in their original location and by specific people. Throughout the walk, there are emergency phones and seats with wooden shelters over them should you become ill or injured and require help. About 9 km’s into the walk, I began to suffer from heat exhaustion, luckily for me it was only very mild and I recovered quickly and was able to finish the walk but do be mindful that heat exhaustion is a possibility on this walk."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Cannot describe in words how beautiful this part of the country is. I had been before about 15 years ago and the difference between then and now is polarizing in the best way. I learned more about culture and history on this visit than on any other tour I have been on. The Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is well maintained and the facilities dotted around the park are great. Do not miss going to this national park.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We had a guided tour which was so informative. I have been here before and hope to come again. Every time I come I learn more. It is a significant and special place. It is a sacred place. It is an awesome natural attraction. Well worth a visit from sunrise to sunset. Feel encouraged to learn the respect this site deserves and is expected.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It would be hard to give Ayer's Rock anything less than five stars. It's visually stunning, and the colours change over the day, particularly at sunset. From a distance it looks like one big smooth rock, but close up reveals it to be more complex than that. Photography is not allowed from one side of the rock, but most other places you're OK. There is something very special about the place, but it's very hard to define that unless you've actually been there."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a definite must see & do! Brilliant informative guides and lots of short trips around Yalara, the surrounding areas and heaps of sightseeing activities. So much to do and see. An absolutely amazing place!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Did the short walk Kantju gorge walk from Mala car park, and that was really nice. Great signage to explain some of the uses of the site by First Nations. Made the mistake to assume the 10km base walk would be as good, and was quite disappointed. For a large section of track, the walk is quite far away, and no better than the road. If I were advising a friend, I would say to do the Kantju gorge walk, and then loop around Uluru by car, and it would be a similar but more pleasant experience. Then go do the Valley of the Winds track at Kata Tjuṯa for a more stimulating and enjoyable walk."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Seems silly to review a very large rock. But seeing it for the first time, rising from the flat plains and then standing in front of it, having seen it for years on tv, films and photos was breathtaking. The changes of colour as the day passes were what I found most surprising,"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A fantastic way to explore the beauty of Ayers Rock and Kings Canyon in luxury tents. Our guide Lachie was fantastic. He's passionate, very well knowledged and a very good chef!! Thanks, Lachie!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What a majestic place. A must visit for every Australian. It is so different to our cites. Plenty of facilities available.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Tour by SEIT small group ..breakfast and knowledgeable commentary...great opportunities to get photos. James and Trent had great connection to country and so willing to teach others
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing experience, especially with a guide to tell you about the history of Uluru and Aboriginal culture associated with it. I loved seeing the stories match up to the indentations in the rock. Segways are my new BFF! So easy to use."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A wonderful place and a must see. Loose yourself in its beauty. It is just the most fabulous rock to walk around. Caves and cave art. Waterhole and some water running down the rock. So much to read and learn on the way around. Take plenty of water.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just wanted to let people know that if you are planning on using the hop on hop off transport to Uluru recommend booking in advance. Don’t know if like this all the time but we flew here from Cairns, hadn’t booked anything and then when we went to get ticket to just do the walk ourselves there were zero available for the next 3 days. You can’t get to Uluru unless part of a tour (none available on this either), use the hop on hop off, have car/transport. Limited hire cars, most already gone but did manage to get a hertz at the resort - available in 2 days time - also high demand. Given mostly people come to actually visit Uluru and do a walk around this is pretty important to know. We are also doing a couple of the experiences although none of these would have had us actually at Uluru. Feeling lucky that we ended up with a car so we still can go."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The most beautiful place in Australia, if you ever have a chance to go you must. Should be on everyones bucket list in my opinion . Should be the face of our nation because of the cultural significance to Indigenous Australians, It's location in the heart of Australia's outback and the sheer beauty of it makes it for me the most iconic place in Australia. If you go, view the sunset at the sunset strip, complete the walk around and be respectful of the signs that ask for no photos and please try to visit the Uluru-Kata Tjuta Cultural Centre in order to learn more about Anangu Culture. If you are on holiday in Australia or live here, try make an attempt to see this cultural icon, Its geographical location makes it difficult for most if not all to make the trip, but trust me its worth the hassle!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I wasnt going to bother writing a review as there as so many but maybe I can help someone. We had a rental car, so had flexibility. If you have a vehicle, dont waste your money on tours. Get to the Rock carpark by 8am and you will miss the crowds. I walked around Uluru, taking in the side trips. It took me two hours. About 2/3 of the way around I started to come across groups of bikers, walkers and the worst, Segways. I had the track to myself for most of it. When I got back to the carpark, it was packed. The cultural centre was average but still worth a look. You can get a coffee at the cafe there. Enjoy your trip as this is a must see."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We tried to get into various tours but had left it too late as it was a last minute trip decision. So…. We walked and drove around Uluru with the Uluru audio guide and it was brilliant. We shared a set of ear buds and as we approached an area of interest or drove near vegetation etc e would hear stories and learn facts about culture, climate, European influence and history. We walked past so many people who could only read the signs and had no idea what they were looking at or walking past. Really really enjoyed it!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Amazing! highly recommend makes you question your significance went in the morning to avoid heat that color! absolutely gorgeous. Not really near anything however.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is a must do in your lifetime. Uluṟu is a magical place to visit. It looms out of nowhere as a majestically wonder of the world. Walking is relatively easy but be prepared with fly nets and water. I have a disability but was able to have a wheelchair around the Lungkata walk. I would highly recommend you purchase the app so that you get a commentary of all the sites. It was great.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I was only twenty years old when I decided to travel to Australia. It was the most intensive experience I have ever had. There wasn't internet no smart phones so the picture I'll upload were made with old fashioned cameras. The place is just magic.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Who hasn't seen Uluru a thousand times on TV shows, in films & photos? It's iconic & world famous & you think you know it until you actually get there & see it with your own eyes! We were lucky enough to be on a tour that did both a sunset viewing & a sunrise viewing as well as a walk around part of the base in the daytime, so we got to see lots of different aspects of 'the rock' at different times of the day. Yes, when all is said & done, it is just 'a big ole rock in the middle of nowhere', but wow, what a sight it is. There was something purely magical about sipping prosecco while waiting for the sun to set. Up at 4am to see the sun rise with a cup of hot tea but we didn't expect it to be quite so chilly (wrap up warm if you're doing a sunrise tour!!) It was very crowded on both occasions as you'd expect, with plenty of indigenous peoples selling paintings. Respect the land, respect the people who the land belongs to & enjoy this natural wonder with joy in your heart."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We flew into Ayers Rock airport to visit Uluru and Kata Tjuta National Park. We stayed for 4 days with a mix of guided tours and car hire. I recommend both as the tours give you an educational experience and the car hire gave us the freedom to visit Uluru when we wished.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Finally had the chance to knock Uluru off the bucket list. It is just incredible and fascinating to see. The sunset view are an absolute must. It adds color and detail to the rock that you don’t see during day time.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is why you’re here. The park pass is $38 for 3 days of access. Each day brings something different and it is the best thing you can do from Yulara. Amazing to see first hand and you could never get sick of things to see. A beautifully managed park.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Simply stunning. We stayed at Ayres Rock Resort for 3 nights and went on the Sacred Sites and Sunset Tour which I’ll probably review separately (both). There’s nothing more I can say about Uluru itself other than everyone should experience coming here at least once in their lifetime.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Australia's most famous landmark is located in central Australia about a 2.5 hour plane ride from Darwin. If you have the time, this is a must see UNESCO site for singles, couples, and families. The half a billion old sandstone Rock arises dramatically from the surrounding desert. the structure stands 348 meters tall and is 9.4 km in circumference. The Rock is a spectacular panorama, but for a surreal experience drive up close to the Rock's base. Climbing to the top along a designated pathway was a popular experience until 2019 when access to the pathway was permanently closed sadly because of damage caused by a few tourists and a few deaths climbing the steep pathway. The best views area generally at sunrise and sunset but anytime is good. There is a small charge for entrance into the park. No camping is allowed but there are a number of nice hotels and other accommodations available in the local area."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,No trip to Australia would be complete without a visit to Uluru. This is the single most iconic view in the country. Take your tome and walk the allowable trails that lead to the rock. Try to get a guided tour so you know the significance of what you are seeing.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did an AAT Uluru Sacred Sites and sunset tour which would highly recommend. Our young tour guide ( Jess) and driver ( Jess) were very knowledgeable about the area,customs and stories. I certainly learnt a lot about the Australian Indigenous culture that I did not know! The sunset over Uluru was spectacular!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Australia's red rock in the centre, awesome experience seeing this magnificent rock in sun set an sun rise. We did the base walk trail right after sun seeing the sunrise. It's a complete different experience walking close to this enormous rock. It has something magic this big red rock"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I've always wanted to see this since as long as I can remember. I took my husband and 2 boys (3 & 5). I was actually excited, it's a place that is so calm, relaxed and at the time there were hardly any people there around 2:30pm. We only did a small walk with young kids. However, we could have spent the day there. So many stories along the trails and is well looked after. It does cost $ 39 per adult to get into the park, I do suggest booking online, plus you will need a Parks pass, which is about $10 per adult. The colour is stunning, the surrounds are fantastic. Only downer us that if you wish to get a souvenir, they are only open 10-2pm. There is beautiful aboriginal art galleries close by aswell, these do come with a hefty price tag. We will return again, definitely something I won't be doing just once! Approx 5 and a half hours from Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I recently visited Uluru with my grown-up son for a 3 day stay. As he was on a budget we chose our activities carefully. First of all we stayed at the Emu Walk apartments so that we could self cater and this worked well. There's an IGA in the nearby town square which had most things. I had pre-purchased our 3 day park pass and had a paper copy to show whenever we took a tour. We visited the Field of Lights on our 1st evening and that worked well. It was just enough to do after an early start to catch our flights to Uluru. We also bought a 1 day pass for the Hop on hop off bus and this also worked really well. Neither of us were fussed about seeing the rock at sunrise so opted for the 8.35 am bus instead. We got off at the Kuniya carpark and walked to the Mala carpark before heading off for the cultural centre where we caught the bus back at lunchtime. We then caught the bus again later in the afternoon to see the sunset. The next day my son went on the Seit tour to Kata Tjuta which he really liked and then we did the Cosmos Astro tour in the evening. The night sky is just amazing and seeing Jupiter and Saturn through a telescope was a rare treat. On our second evening we ate at the Arnguli restaurant as a treat and the food was delicious. We loved that they used bush spices in all of their dishes. I think we were both happy with our choice of activities and my son was super pleased that the trip had not blown his budget.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's truly inspiring, however it does need maintenance around a lot of areas. Especially around the outdoor shade and seating areas. Staff in the cafe area were very friendly and helpful considering how under staffed they were. Still highly recommend visiting at least once in your lifetime"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Its shape is so well known that there is a chance seeing it form a distance for the first time will be an anti-climax. However, travel to its base and see its features close up to fully appreciate both its enormity and its weathered texture. Some sides of the rock are sign-posted as sacred according to aboriginal culture and photos are banned, but unless there is a ranger around (unlikely), the policy is unenforceable. People say that the rock's colours change as the sun rises and sets. We attended the latter and witnessed no discernable change. There are many events held around the rock at sunrise and sunset. We attended two: Field of Light at sunset (Poor, see separate review) and Sounds of Silence (OK, see separate review)."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our flight was delayed by three hours, giving us time to study the land we hoped to visit and learn more about the Aboriginal culture, life, myths, and magic embodied in an ancient place called Uluru. The rock is considered the oldest, dating over 500 million years. As we made our first trip to view the sunset, we could see this monolithic masterpiece in the distance, undeniably the crowning masterpiece in our great land. The closer the view, (approximately 15-20 kilometres from the sunset viewing platform), the colour kept on changing rapidly. The height of the rock is 350 metres, the length is 2.8 kilometres with a perimeter of 10.5 kilometres, As we had our eyes glued on the massive structure, all I could say was, this is breathtakingly beautiful! A few aboriginal words of welcome! Palya! Welcome to the Anangu land-Pukulpa pitjam Ananguku ngurakutu!! Watching the sunset at Uluru is one of the most memorable events one will experience in a lifetime, as it takes it to a whole new level. The vastness of the desolate desert and the ever-changing rock texture offers an experience second to none. One will observe the rock changing from a dark brown, to a vibrant orange, and then a flaming red colour. Never has the morning been so rewarding! The temperature dipped to 3 degrees. We were awake before dawn and travelled to the cultural centre for information and a light breakfast. The The Uluru base walk commenced in basking sunshine whilst being attacked from all sides by flies. They are relentless in their approach, and the fly nets are the only defence. We decided on the Uluru base walk since it is the best way to fully appreciate the natural and cultural beauty of Uluru (10.8 kilometres) at 2:00 pm, and a brisk walk would return us to the start by 5:30 pm to view the Kata Tjuta sunset."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Great trip and day and a fantastic guide thankyou Mon greatly appreciated it was a a day we both enjoyed
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Awesome day trip. Long hours on coach, but we were prepared for it. Paid extra for front seats on the coach - well worth it. Great guide around Uluru, great views, especially at sunset - took so many photios."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,WOW. I simply cannot get enough of this beautiful masterpiece. I could look at her all day. Different in every kind of light. To experience just visit. Make sure you do the sunrise experience. You need to purchase a permit to enter the grounds about $35 an adult for 3 days. A number of tracks to explore to savour her beauty. Make sure you do one of the dinner events and field of lights. Simply breath taking
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,An amazing place to visit and loved walking the Kata Tjuta trails and also riding our bikes around Uluṟu. The sunset watching Uluṟu was incredible.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ignore people when they say it's just a big lump in the middle of the desert; it's so much more. Get up close by doing the 11km base walk to view some ancient rock art, some quiet pools and the incredible features of the rock - a highlight of our trip."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was something I have wanted to do for a long time. It is a must for every Australian. To see such an iconic landmark. You cannot imagine the enormity of this, nor where people used to climg."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The landscape is so different and impressive.I took the hop on hop off bus and got off at the Mala carpark, there at 10 in the morning ther is a free tour with a local ranger, telling the story of the local people and showing signs of a long history near the rock.The walk/tak is some 2 hours but really worth it.No payment was asked but you need to have the park pass. Then i walked most part of the circumference, and there are clear signs where photography is not allowed, many signs with explanations on the way. Take a fly net as the flies get into every place of your head and face. I recommend spending a whole day here."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is one of the most amazing places on earth. Its colours change continually throughout the day and night. One can experience it on foot, cycling and other ways."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is awesome. The colour changes at sunset, the changing environment on the base walk, and impressive features in the rock make it a fantastic holiday stop"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is quite amazing seeing the rock so close. We hired bikes with the kids, a tandem for my 4 year old and myself and my wife on a bike and our other 9 year old daughter. Although it was a 15km total ride from the bike hire place the kids handled it quite well. The bikes to ride around the rock are a great idea. The only thing is they don't give you quite enough time to fully enjoy the splendor as you had to have the bikes back by 12am. At the end of the bike ride the kids got a certificate to say they had ridden around Ayres rock. The kids were wrapped, great for show and tell at school. Highly suggest the trip. You can fly straight from sydney direct to Uluru."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We paid our $38pp for our three day pass which allows us to visit Uluru and Kata Tjuṯa (the Olgas). We chose to visit Uluru first, we have been here before but we had a car this time and had a much better look around. We walked to Mutitjulu Waterhole which was quite full after the recent rains, on the way back we stopped off to view the aboriginal art and walked along a path to view the rock from different angles. We took quite a drive around the bottom and we couldn't help be impressed by the different faces of this iconic rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This does not really need a review! However, to get a stunning sunrise view of the rock, go to the Olgas sunrise viewing platform and get there before sunrise."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We did the Uluru sunrise Field of Lights tour with AAPT this morning. Tour guides Jess & Tush were lovely. The lights were beautiful and the view of Uluṟu was amazing! Well worth the early wake up!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru / Kata Tjuta sacred site and national park in the Northern Territory desert of central Australia is an amazing place to visit. Flying into Uluru airport gives great aerial views of both Uluru, Kata Tjuta and the super flat desert which was once an underwater sea bed. Absolutely loved my visit to Uluru. I was there 3 nights, and totally loved the vibe, the desert, the amazing red rock and desert sand against the blue sky was so awesome. A must do if coming to Australia. The Hotel site is at Yulara Voyagers Ayers Rock Resort and there are a number of hotels there at different star rating levels, cabins and a camping site. There is a supermarket in the Town Square where you can buy supplies and do some shopping for unique artwork and items. From the Hotels there is a Hop on Hop off bus services which takes you at set times out to Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Hiring a car gives you best flexibility. You will need to buy a National Parks pass which you will need to show when entering the Uluru site, you can easily buy it online and download the pass onto your phone. The bus ride from the Hotel to Uluru took about 30mins and has a number of pick up bus stops on the way. The bus ride to Kata Tjuta is about 40mins, it is further away from the Hotel in the opposite direction to Uluru. Uluru is a 10km walk around the base, and walking or bike riding it (you can book onto the cycling tour to access a bike) are the up close to the rock options. Driving around the Rock you aren't as close but is still a good option, particularly if you aren't very mobile, you will still get a great experience. They say it takes 3-3.5 hours to walk the 10kms, I feel this is a very ambitious timing. To get the most out of being there doing a slower walk and having time to just sit and feel the amazing ambience there is a must. You'll need to make sure you time your walk to meet the bus to return to the Hotel. Kata Tjuta has 2 walks - 1 hour and 3 hours. This sacred site is completely different to Uluru. Uluru is one huge monolith rock, whereas Kata Tjuta is multitudes of big round boulders and sheer rock faces in a clump. This vibes there are amazing. The short walk is up a Gorge, really fantastic. The 3 hour walk is a marked path winding through the boulders. It is very serene and interesting. Doing the Sunrise and Sunset visits to the viewing platforms is a must. Absolutely stunning. Amazing photos you can take! There are quite a few spots you are forbidden to photograph at Uluru, these are the aboriginal people's most sacred places and the park rangers enforce the no photography rule. This is a sacred site so no taking anything from there or leaving anything there, if you tune in you can feel the high vibes. Temperatures in the desert can get to 45+ degrees celsius in the summer months Nov-March and the walks around Uluru are closed by park rangers once temperatures reach 39 degrees celsius. Best to go there on the first bus, early in the morning and do all your walking before midday. Visiting April to October the temperatures are much lower so all day walking may be possible which is why it is the peak visiting season then. Nights are cold during the winter and warm in the summer. I did the Sounds of Silence desert dinner and it was fantastic. They do their best to accomodate dietary needs (let them know in advance what you need). There's a great astronomy talk, a didjeridoo performance, you are seated at tables of 10 and the dinner is buffet style so you can choose what you want to eat yourself. A fabulous experience. I used the hop on hop off bus tickets and found that easy and the bus is an airconditioned coach, very comfortable. Bring your own water bottles, you can refill them yourself the tap water is fine to drink. I took 2 water bottles as it was super hot 41 degrees celsius each day, in mid-march. That worked really well. I also took a fly net to cover my face, and long sleeves top and pants and wide brimmed hat for sun protection. You really need good sun protection as you can fry & dehydrate out there. Visit the Ayers Rock Resort website to see all the activities."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The surreal atmosphere and unique flora and fauna make it a special destination. It is a sacred site for Aboriginal people and is filled with Aboriginal legends. It is a great place to learn about the culture of the Aboriginal people and to appreciate the beauty of nature. Highly recommended!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So you can spend 6 hours on a uncomfortable coaxh or fly into the local airport or a combination of both to get here. It started well with is as we were taken out for a sunset view of the rock which was very impressive. Then the next couple of days are spent looking at the thing from different angles and walks around it. Quite frankly it is all to much in unbearable heat and masses of flies buzzing around you. You are herded around like cattle, 1 tour bus following the next. Then of course you get to the hotel complex ( Yulara ) this reminded me a little of a Disney resort, every hotel is owned by the same company and as there is absolutely no where else they can go, they have got you and can charge what ever they like, and they certainly do this, as an example our hotel wanted $ 13 for a 330ml bottle of Beer and $18 for a glass of wine, that works out at around £7 & £10. There is slightly cheaper places but in general it is very expensive. I know the review is about Urulu but the overall experience was to long and to expensive."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a 20 min drive from Yulara/Voyages Resort. Kata Juta is approximately 50 mins. You need a parks pass for each person whether visiting as part of a tour group or self-drive. There are plenty of viewing platforms for optimum viewing at sunrise and sunset and self-guided walks. There is also an excellent, FREE, ranger-guided walk departing from the Mala Walk car park, 8am daily. I have visited Uluru-Kata Juta National park twice. The first time I did several bus tours to all of the different sites (sunrise and sunset), the evening BBQ and Field of Light. The second time we hired a car from the airport and took ourselves around the various viewing platforms, walks and the cultural centre. We also did the free ranger guided walk. We saved $800 via the second method (between 3 of us) and were able to come and go as we pleased and stay as long as we liked. The park maps are excellent for each site and the park signs tell you everything you may hear on a bus tour. Note, you can only see the field of light on an organised tour. We did the one which includes sunset canapés and drinks. $100 per head. It was excellent."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Fantastic tour around the national park learning all about its history. Our accredited guide shared information about the Aboriginal history and stopped at some important sites along the way. Great views of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. A great way to visit Australia's red centre.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is probably Australia's most famous natural icon. This huge sandstone monolith stands 1,142 ft above ground (taller than Eiffel Tower 984 ft). Much of this island mountain is actually below ground to a depth of 1.5 miles. Its base has a circumference of 6 miles. It is sacred to the Aboriginals and many parts are closed to outsiders and photography is prohibited. Climbing was banned in 2017. It was ""discovered"" by surveyor William Gosse in 1873 and has been a popular tourist site since 1936. If you are able, try to see Uluru at different times of the day to witness it appear to change colors from a purplish tint at sunrise to red during bright sunlight."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you ever have a chance, see this ancient rock. I saw Sydney and Melbourne but the 3 days I spent here really gave me perspective on Australia. I hope I live to see it again, truly awe inspiring. Sunrise at the rock was spectacular."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One of the most magical and awe-inspiring sights you will ever see. Viewed both as the sun sets and in the early morning as the sun rises, really are spectacles to behold. My advice would be to do all the tours and see as much of it as possible because it really is nature at its most magnificent. We pre-booked the evening Sunset, Dinner and Field of Lights tour, which allows you to watch the sunset over the rock followed by an outside buffet dinner. You sit on round tables with your fellow coach group members eating a pretty good buffet under the stars. Following this they plunge the whole area into total darkness to see stars that are normally impossible to see. There's also a very good commentary with laser pointer! Finally, you walk the Field of Lights, which is an incredibly clever and beautiful installation. It's very well organised and we enjoyed the four plus hours we were there."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Had a great few days in Uluṟu. We didn’t realise all accomodation is 24km away and the tours we pre-booked had a view of Uluṟu and Kata-Tjuta, yet not right there. We got a tip to get on the hop on/ hop off bus, which took you right there to explore in your own time. I’ve added the latest prices and information."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayres Rock is an amazing place. It it much more than a rock. It is more like a mystical mountain comprised mainly of one giant red sandstone. It is important to take a full official tour to learn about the aboriginal aspects of the place.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The deep connection I feel when visiting the outback of Australia with the red earth, the silver vegetation and the deep blue of the sky. There is little wonder that Uluru is the number 1 destination in Australia. We were here for 3 days but plan for 4 + your arrival day and departure day. The longer you stay and the more frequent you view Uluru - sunrise, sunset, from the air, riding around the base on a mtn bike or a Segway, close up or at a distance - it leaves an indelible mark on your being."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is my second trip to Uluṟu and I love coming here, as there are always different things to do and see. We stayed at the Lost Camel hotel, which was very nice with a pleasant pool. Last time I stayed at Sails in the Desert, which was very pleasant too. My favourite thing this time was doing the camel trek. It was very well run by Brett and Ella. It was exhilarating riding through the desert in the evening with wonderful views of Uluṟu."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"SEIT Outback Australia tour company is one of the best I have encountered. Specialising in small group tours, you get to see more and with a better personal experience. Their vehicles are spotless, air conditioned and new, and the guides are fabulous. I have been on a lot of tours, both in Australia and overseas and this tour company is one of the best companies I have dealt with as they really look after their customers."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had the opportunity to drive around Ayer’s Rock during the afternoon and view some of the caves and a waterhole. We then stayed around to watch the sunset which was great light for photos. Since we stayed at one of the nearby hotels, we got up early the next morning and watched the sunrise on the other side of the rock. There are parking and viewing areas for both sunset and sunrise with toilets. The sunrise area also has some elevated viewing platforms."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So, this is supposed to be a ""must see"", and it was nice, but it is just a large rock. So, don't get your expectations too high. I enjoyed seeing it and it is interesting that there are no other large rocks like this in the immediate area, but there are other rocks near there. Some people walked around the entire base of the rock, which I think would have been interesting if we had the time."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Sunrise camel ride❤️ The scenery is breath taking; the tour guide is informative and cheerful. The camels are gentle. The breakfast was superb!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Fantastic place to visit, you don't realise how big The Rock is Until you're looking at it. The scenery is stunning. I hired a car for a day and drove around the rock and out to Kata Tjuta, it has so many faces. We did as much as we could in 4 days * Fabulous BBQ dinner. * The sunset camel tour was also amazing. * Scenic Flight - Stunning Views * Sounds Of Silence We visited the Town centre every day for coffee and some yummy food at Kulata Academy Cafe, a very friendly place. Loved it All such beautiful sights to see and very helpful and friendly staff everywhere we visited. Go you'll Love it !"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The utterly unique environment and the sunset/sunrise camel tour is a must! Going to the Field of lights on a clear day provides an unbelievable view at the southern night sky
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This place is amazing we used the hop on hop off bus rather than a tour and it was perfect. It was a very early get up for the first bus out so we could see the sunrise then got off the bus at Mutijuli ( the watering hole) then we walked to Mala car park ( there’s a toilet and water there.) We had time to walk on past the womens caves to the gorge and back in time for the pick up. This was a great time to be out there as there weren't many people around and you had time to be in awe of the size of Uluru and to feel the spiritual nature of the lands.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing, must do if you get a chance to. This place will blow you away with its sheer size and scenery. Walk around it even better cycle around it and best of all fly over it!! Just do it!! Sunset or sunrise it will leave you in awe!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It was neat to learn about why that area is sacred and how it's important to the Aboriginal People. We did not walk all the way around it, but you could. There are Segway and bike tours that you can arrange. Uluru was a beautiful area to be in when the sun was setting."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Amazing. Awesome. It's stunning from the plane ride in to the walking by it. Learning about it's history is great as well. It's just an awesome thing to see in person
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Frankly, I was expecting something a bit bigger. That said, some of the trees that grow near the rock are great - like something out of a Dr Seuss book."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Well worth the visit. We had a picnic and watched the sunset and truly appreciated the beauty of it all. We drove around Uluṟu and stopped for a few walks…….the walk to the waterhole was lovely….and would recommend seeing it.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Both Uluru and Kata Tjuta have excellent walking trails. The base track at Uluru is easy walking but takes 2-3 hours to cover the 10+km. We are 67/72 and experienced no difficulty. At times the track is some distance from the rock, perhaps they could move the rock closer to the path! The longest Kata Tjuta walk requires a reasonable level of fitness being undulating and rocky in places. Take the usual water, sunscreen etc and enjoy a morning or evening walk."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This place is very special. It does have real magical feel I didnt believe until I was there, It is truly an amazing natual wonder. We did sunrise and sunset and it certainly didnt disappoint with varying colours and it illuminates a vibrant bright orange at sunset that no other rock formation does. The 10km walk around the base is worth seeing every aspect and learning about the aboriginal cultural significance of this place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow. Amazing experience being up close and feeling the energy of this landmark. There is something very powerful about Uluru that you need to feel it once in your lifetime at least. And a very good reason not to climb this place, it is sacred and if you have an ounce of spirituality in you, you know it needs to be revered - and not climbed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A beautiful almost mystical place to be for the whole day: in fact light changes almost continuously and the way the sacred monolite presents itself is different It worths the trip
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Got to visit this beautiful place in February of 2021! Had the base of the rock all to ourselves and enjoyed exploring. It was incredible just how massive this rock really is! Loved seeing the ancient art on the rocks too. Visited the Olga’s while we were at it, and got to enjoy the look out on our own! Enough time to see it all in a day."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"In the last two years our trip to Uluru has been cancelled. Uluru Travel refunded the full amount for the two years. We finely got to go this July. What a wonderfull experience all thanks to Uluru Travel. They had arranged a hot air ballon ride, a helicopter ride and a fixed plane ride, all flights were on time and we were so impressed the with the pilots and there commentary and happy nature towards their guests. The accommodation was first class. The hire vehicle was great. We had not one thing to complain about. Thank you Uluru Travel. If you are heading to NT for a holiday I strongly recommend speaking to Uluru Travel."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A beautiful, spiritual place to visit. So many ways to see it. 3 days plenty of time to do most of it. So glad they have stopped people from climbing"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When visiting the rock you are blown away by the sheer size of it. It is without question breathtaking. Even from 30 kms away, you find it hard to comprehend that this is something natural, in a place that seems so far away from everything. There is so much to do at the rock and try to spend time here at all different times of the day to see how the light changes the colour and feel."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,If you have the chance you should definitely visit Uluru. It is quite incredible and nothing really prepares for the size of this monolith and the beautiful changing colours.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just come back from Uluru and must do for all. Did Uluru, Kata Tjuta and well as Kings Canyon. If you go, don’t forget to look up tours to Mt Conner. It’s the Fool-Uluru. On private property and limited tours. We stayed at Sails in the Desert. And was a very good spot to be. Also did helicopter ride around Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Well worth the money. To enjoy it all more, make sure you have some fitness as you won’t get into some of the more interesting places otherwise. For those who have mobility issues, you can still do a lot of things but just not the trail walks. People out there are so friendly and helpful. Unless you are really fit, stick to the cooler/winter months. Also the flies will be really bad as well. Fly in and out is the way to go. The airport is not far from Yulara town centre which is where all the accommodation is. From there you are about 20k from Uluru and about 50k from Kata Tjuta."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Obviously a must do. We loved the Rock and did the Base Walk. A must if you really want to get a sense of the place and the view the many changing faces of the Rock.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We experienced the Uluru Kata Tjuta tour. We booked via Emu run tours. Unfortunately I was appalled at the guide who told us we had one hour to complete the track and if we were back late there would be not toilet break. Our toilet break should have been before the tour start but this didn’t happen. This made an very uncomfortable day. As this should have been a pleasure. We did the hop on hop off bus later that week which was much more pleasing and half the price.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I have seen pictures however nothing prepared me for this amazing sight. Just Fabulous especially the changing colour on facade.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The 348 high sandstone Inselberg or island mountain is iconic and a must see. Originally named Ayers Rock by surveyor William Gosse in 1873 after the Chief Secretary of South Australia Sir Henry Ayers. In 1993 it took on dual names.The sheer size is evident as you walk around the mountain. Paths and infrasrtructure are quite good.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The “Heart of Australia” is the best, most magical, awesome placeI have ever visited even the second time. Uluṟu with it’s changing faces, bumps, grooves, caves, and amazing colours is truly magnificent. A pass is needed to visit the national park. There is a walking/ cycling path and road around the base of the rock. The hop on hop off bus can be booked at the information centre in Yulara."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Walking around Uluru was amazing it is a really impressive natural wonder and the red centre is a must do if your visiting Australia. We waited for the sunset at Uluru which wasn’t as impressive as I imagined but this may have been due to it being very cloudy.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is a great place to visit and never disappoints, my second visit. We rode the segways around and it was a great way to see the rock"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A monolith - single piece of rock just 300 million years old - takes your breadth away in its natural beauty. Anytime of the day it is an amazing experience worth driving miles for. Don't miss sunset and sunrise - they both are splendid and shows the rocks in different colour shades. Finally, have some fly protection whenever you want go"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"AAPT bus trips were very unorganised. Everyday for the outings, the bus that picked us up never had our names. The bus we boarded for walk was wrong bus, no one seem to know, when we realised and met up with the correct bus and were going to change to correct bus, the driver of that bus Eddy drove off without us having said we could board and would take us when we finished walk. We had to rush the walk, not easy, and all for nothing as eddy had left. The only buses that had correct passenger lists were the Segway tour, the camel tour, and the helicopter ride. Walks, field of lights, and sounds of silence dinner were all completely disorganised."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It’s a very small airport with minimum facilities - think of it like you would a small island. The locals are warm and friendly. There is not a ton of choices to eat out. Being to Uluru is an amazing experience. I happen to love deserts so being there with the history etc. was amazing. Make sure you make the most of the night sky. You fell like you can touch the stars.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,An amazing must do experience. I'm so glad we drove all that way from NSW to see this spectacular place. Its bigger than I thought it would be and there is nothing around near it. Truly amazing
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is spiritual magic, you stand there in desolate desert, viewing a natural wonder, inspiring humans throughout millennia. Breathtaking to realise the importance of this place to so many"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Such a special place to visit. We bought a three day park pass to enjoy the rock one day, and the olga's the next. Not a bad drive straight up from Coober Pedy, around 8 hours."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,An amazing experience to see Ayers Rock close up. The sheer size of the rock and the many changes in appearance depending on the time of day and the weather. A humbling experience.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My wife and me visited this thing after a long flight from the USA. Coming from Idaho we love rocks and this one could not have been bigger! My wife said that this was in her top 3 rocks so that is really saying something! her other two best rocks are Dwayne Johnson and rock and roll. We did the tour with an unofficial tour guide, Darrell, because it was much cheaper and were amazed to hear that the aboriginals built this over a 75 year period just like the pyramids. He said they painted it red so that they could see it better from a distance which make sense. Genius! There are still a handful of aborigines left in Australia and another thing that Darrell taught us is that they ride kangaroos. We learned so much! If you go to Uluru (which by the way is aboriginal for huge big red rock) ask around for a guy named Darrell to take you."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"WE went on Desert Awakenings tour with Luke. We were very lucky as we were the only two people on board, as the tour vehicle can accommodate up to 26 people. Luke was very knowledgeable, very engaging and fun to ne with. Luke never missed a beat with commentary, which could happen with just two people. From very nice breakfast, with sunrise on Uluru, to up close and in person with Uluru. Amazing rock formation. You need to see how steep it is, up close where people used to walk on it. It is good to see that know one can walk on Uluru anymore."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Stunning. This morning we went on the Uluru Sunrise and Kata Tjuta Valley of the Winds tour with a 4:30am pickup. In days gone by, tourist busses and cars would drive in and park where they liked but now there’s a $21 million viewing platform where everyone has to go. Thankfully with COVID, our group of 13 was the only one there. Pre-COVID we’re told that there would be hundreds of people pushing around to get photos. Next we went to Kata Tjuta again but this time to the Valley of the Winds and windy it was, but spectacular to get so close to these huge rocks. On the way back we stopped at the Kata Tjuta Dune Viewing Platform where we could see both Kata Tjuta and Uluru. Powerful."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I had The Best experience with Sarah guiding us on Desert Awakenings; from the get-go this was my favourite Uluru experience! We were treated to a beautiful dawn over Uluru, delicious brekky and informative tours along the base of Uluru. Thanks Sarah!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Depending on the time of day, this huge rock appears to be different colours. At times a brilliant red, others orange or purple. I think all Australians should see this natural attraction,"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Revisited this wonderful place after an absence of 35 years. It’s even better now than before due I think to the controlled management and reversal back to its traditional culture. We did the early morning Marla walk with a ranger guide named Owen. He was really quite knowledgable and filled us all in as much as he could about the traditional cultures and beliefs about Uluru. We also did both sunset and sunrise photo shoots at the designated locations and again we came across rangers both times willing to share knowledge. Since closing the climb down and improving the management, the place really feels spiritual and very special. Make sure you visit the waterholes too."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Absolutely incredible! Definitely worth the effort no matter how you get there! We drove over 3000kms to see a big red rock in the middle of Australia and we were in awe! The size, cultural significance to the indigenous, the colours just the entire experience! We did a 2hr guided free tour with an indigenous ranger from Mala car park and then did the base walk. Highly recommend a visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We hadnt planned to go to ULURU but with the border closure we were stuck in the NT so decided to go there.I had never seen Uluru so it was a treat.We could see it from a hilltop at the campsite but even more impressive close up.We did the base walk around which was great as you see so many more facets of the rock and hidden gems in between.The changing of the colours of the rock and the shadows casted are beautiful.You will need to buy a park pass and dont think you can bypass this as you have to scan in to get through the gate
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My third time here, first with my partner. Such an amazing place! The energy is very gentle yet significant... Will come again."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing place to visit, some of the staff particularly the cafe and entrance admission gate need some serious people person lessons"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This Monolith, known as Ayers Rock is amazing . It changes color at different times of the day or sunset. You can’t walk on it any longer as it is a sacred site to the Aboriginal people. You can hire a guide to explain the various points of interest."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A wonderful visit to this Aussie icon. Very glad we went. The Mala walk was interesting and easy. Would have loved to do the base walk but the kids complained. Just a stunning sight from every angle. Visitor Centre just OK.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"An Australian Icon that is seen in real life just exceeds expectations. We saw it in so many ways... from far, from the sunrise on a camel to dinner at sunset at the rock to walk around the base of Uluru. From every angle, it tells a story of Aboriginal ancestors. The feeling I got when I saw the scar on the rock (that was from all the years of people trying to climb the rock)... was heart-breaking and that really gave me such a deep love and understanding of how special Uluru is.... It's a trip that needs to be taken once in your lifetime!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What can you say about such an Australian Icon? But seeing it in real life still exceeded expectations - absolutely fabulous. Enjoyed the base walk, and especially starting with the free guided tour. Led by an enthusiastic, friendly and knowledgeable guide, this tour was excellent. So glad we eventually got to see it. Will never forget this trip."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We were determined to complete the full-circuit Uluru Base walk on our visit and very glad we did. The loop walk is 10.6 km long though track is well marked and completely flat. So, while not a difficult walk we still found it tiring, especially as we were on the track through 12-2 pm and it was pretty warm, even in June. The part of the walk on the 'other side' of Uluru moves some distance from the Rock at times and is relatively boring. Consider hiring a bike if doing the full loop as a walk is not that important to you. The most interesting bits are certainly along the Mala and Lungkata sections of the track. All up, the full circuit took us 4 hours but we spent nearly half of that on ranger's guided tour of the Mala Walk."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I’ve always heard about Ayers Rock, or better, Uluru, since I was a child, and I’ve always been charmed by it. I made a lot of researches, it’s not only a “mountain”, a “monolite”, it’s much more. Aborigines consider it as the holiest place in their culture, and they can be often seen advising tourists not to climb it, not much or only because it’s dangerous, but also and above all because of its holiness. But luckily for Aborigines, climbing Uluru has been forbidden since October 2019!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru really is a place most Australians would love to visit and it is worth going. The rock really is amazing, changing with every movement of the sun and the clouds. It is a pity the road is not open at night for astrophotography. On sunrise, the sunrise platform is somewhat annoying and doesn't really give you the best possible sunrise view of Uluru, though Kata-Tjuta glows red in the background. We did a base walk around the rock and would recommend doing this in the morning when there is more shadow around the base. It was a great walk - just a little uncomfortable in full noon sun and I would only do it in the early morning if the temperature was high."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went in June and it was a lot colder than what I had expected on the plus side it meant I wasn’t hot and flies were not an issue. Sails in the Desert have halal meat options and we immensely enjoyed the lunch and dinner there however I am glad we stayed at the Emu apartments as we were able to mostly self cater and wash clothes. The local iga sells halal meat products and vilis pies I do not recommend the desert dining experience as most of the money is on the alcohol and the meat was not halal there. Field of light was great however I paid the extra for the star pass and again, because we don’t drink it wasn’t worth the extra. The aerial view wasn’t worth it, walking around the installation was the better part of the experience. The Camel Farm was worth the time, especially if you have children, as you learn about the contribution of Muslim cameleers plus the animals there are cute. I recommend doing at least one tour be it for Uluru or Kara Tjuta so you can learn about the formations etc but do one or the other on your own. Hire a car for $200 a day and self navigation to those sights is easy. Kings canyon is a 3 hour drive and we thoroughly enjoyed it, a tour for this would be better. Kata tjuta has two walking options, an easy 1hr Walpa Gorge walk and the intense 2-3 hr spectacular Valley of the Winds walk. Itinerary: Day 1. Kings canyon tour Day 2 Uluru sunrise tour Field of light sunset Day 3 Kata Tjuta sunrise tour Camel farm Recommend going back to Uluru for sunset"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was sceptical that we could do the base walk with a 1 year old (and a little nervous) but we knew it was something we would regret not doing. Most of the walk is firm sand which is easy to push a stroller over but it does get softer in parts. Our daughter walked for parts of it and thankfully fell asleep for an hour and for the rest of the time we kept her happy with snacks. The walk took us 4 hours. I highly recommend taking a blanket and wrapping your little one up if you plan to go early as it is very cold and windy at points of the walk. There are small stops along the way at caves, watering holes and aboriginal art. At every turn there is a different perspective to this magnificent rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Did the 3 hour walk around Uluru found it very hard but enjoyable take a net flies are buggers Took many pics around the mountain well worth the visit
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"WOW what an epic place to visit, the size of the rock is enormous and breathtaking in it’s beauty. The rock changes colour regularly adding to the experience. I think it best to go to the sunset view point at about 4.30pm with a chair and sit and watch the rock until sunset - rock will change colour multiple times before the amazing sunset. Cost is $38pp for 3 day park pass (it’s a bit of a money grab that you can’t get a day pass) but as long as money goes to maintain this natural wonder I don’t mind. I would recommend getting park pass online quick and easy. Takes about 15 -20 minutes to get to Uluru from Ayres Rock Resort complex."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You really have no idea just how big this rock is until you are up close to it. Pictures do not do it justice. Although you can't climb it anymore, we did the base walk and there are sections where you can get up close to the rock to view all the little caves, waterholes etc. There are places around this walk where you cannot take photos due to cultural sensitivity but that is ok. There are plenty of photo opportunities elsewhere. It is a must of course if you go to the NT."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you are in Australia, you need to visit Uluru. It is spectacular. I have no doubt that the word awesome was invented to describe this amazing place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After spending $1.92 per litre for petrol, and $2.10 for Auto Gas we arrived at the gates to the Uluru National Park. There were no signs showing the entry fee until we reached the the ticket office. For 3 people for three days it was $114.00, $38.00 each. There were no day passes available, three days was the minimum. When we asked the ticket seller about a one day pass she replied ""everyone asks for that"". In addition there were no Senior or Pensioner discounts available. We chose not to enter and turned around in the well used reversing loop. We immediately made the decision to return home, ignore our Prime Ministers pleas to spend our holiday dollars in Australia , save our money and as soon as we can, head overseas and give them our hard earned money. We found the price exorbitant, the practice of concealing the entry fee deceptive, but the ticket lady was very polite. Never again, overseas here we come!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You cant takes your eyes off it and the way the colors change with the sunlight ,the closer you you get there is something about it"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ride around the Rock and get that full experience - well posted signs and information. The changing shape of the rock gives quite a different perspective to the single frame picture we have been used too over the years. The warmer it is the more water to take!!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,stunning! It's a big orange rock that with the sun changes its colour at sunrise and sunset. it's very important for the aborigines.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you have a vehicle, you can drive to see sunrise and sunset without going on a tour. You get the same view, but maybe not the extra info but you can Google it. You can do the easy walk all the way around it by yourselves & view from different sides if you have a vehicle."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We stayed at Sails for 3 nights and accommodation was excellent. Did numerous treks each day at Uluru and Kata Tjuta Must do the Dinner of Silence and field of Lights display
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It doesn't rise up, its just there. You see it long before you get to it. It's huge. And until you have tried to fit it all into one photo, you can only imagine it's size. Its colours, stories & history are mesmerising. Give yourself at least 4 days out there to really get a chance to see it in all its colours"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Has to be seen to understand the sheer size of it. Went out for a sunset and watched the rock change colours. Also had a full moon rising at the same time.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This morning we did the Uluru sunrise and kata tjuta with AAPT. Dave n Dylan we very friendly and knowledgeable hosts/driver.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is a bucket list thing to do... walk around the most iconic land mark in this country. The walk took me 2 hours to walk around the rock approximately 10 kilometers but make sure you do it 1st thing before the heat, it’s flat all the way so pretty easy walking. There is a shorter walk you can do and that is approximately 850m that still gets you up close and personal to the rock. Make sure you have lots of water, fly repellent or a fly net as the flies can drive you made depending on the time of year. At the main carpark there is toilets, drinking water taps. Be sure to pre purchase your tickets online before hand to save time. Happy Travels!! 😎😎😎😎"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is not possible to add to so many reviews with anything unique. So, instead, let me outline what I think a person can do in 48 hours, which is exactly the length of our recent tour. Firstly, hats off to JetStar for providing a good and reliable service from Melbourne. Uluru is approx. 3 hours away, and is more like 2.5 hours when returning. Similar for Sydney. Less for other places. So in this COVID-19 era, Australians get going - look at your own backyard, rather than waiting for other places to reopen. (I know. I sound like a TV ad, but the ads are true.) Secondly, hats off to the Sails in the Desert Hotel. I stayed at this place in 1986 when it was the Sheraton. Now, on my return visit, it has a new name and it is still in great shape. Lovely rooms. Lovely lobby and shop area. The Yulara town centre offers great short walks (a great lookout) and free cultural talks and activities. Well worth doing. The tour companies offer some very good tours. Generally it is the driver/guide who makes a tour memorable. Hats off to Sol at AAT Kings. Some members of my group went on the back of a Harley Davidson in a trike around Uluru and they said it was brilliant. Some members of my group did the 2-hour flight over all major sights in the area and also gave it a verdict of being brilliant. Atmosphere and vibe - excellent. How can you tire of admiring the red earth and all the contrasts, especially at sunrise and sunset. Lastly, even though I have written 'hats off' several times in this review, maybe a hat was not needed , but fly nets are an absolute necessity."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There is so much more to Uluru than just being the worlds biggest single monolith. The massive size is just one of the rocks appeal. Being older with knee issues we still found the Mala Walk and the Mutitjulu Waterhole easy to access. Rock art, waterholes and tadpoles (due to recent rain) kept us interested while the sheer size of the rock was absolutely breathtaking."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We first visited the Cultural Centre to begin an understanding of the foundation stories from the areas people’s. I think this is essential to truly enjoying Uluru and its fascination. Dylan our guide shared the stories that are significant, and gave some history and context for the stories that made the walk so amazing. We finished the walk sipping wine or beer, while watching the incredibly colourful sunset. I definitely recommend doing this tour, before you do any others if possible as it sets up your understanding of the area and it’s significance to Australian people."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We stayed 5 nights in the area and could have easily done another couple of nights here. We bought an annual pass for $50 to give us unlimited access during our stay. We saw the sunset over Uluru from a camel, sunrise on a Segway tour, we went to sunset and sunrise viewing platforms on different days, we drove around Uluru at various times of the day, we did the ranger guided Mala walk, we visited the waterhole one morning to enjoy the serenity, we saw the sun rising over Uluru from a distance on our scenic flight, we did a flight over Uluru mid morning .... there was always something different to see and absorb from each experience so please do not just visit this place once or twice if you have a choice. We were even lucky enough to see rain fall on the rock, see the rock go from red to grey in colour with the rain, see waterfalls at various places, see the waterhole fill up and hear the glorious sounds as frogs came out after the rain. COVID and summer meant minimal crowds and I was thankful to have many moments of being able to sit or stand in total silence and just absorb the awesomeness of this place. Uluru will move and change you if you take the time to let this happen. This is the precious gift Anangu have given us."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Wonderful colours at Sunrise & Sunset from a number of well designed & accessible viewing platforms at both Uluru & Kata Tjuta (Olgas). Make sure you take flynets as flies wake up at sunrise & are unrelenting.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I've been to there on May 2019 with my family. (I cannot choose the term 'cause I wrote so late.) It's really interesting place to know Aboriginal culture and the environment of center of Australia. The sunset is really beautiful . But, for me, the Free guided walk (Mala walk) is the very good experience. I was moved by ranger's explanation about the climbing Uluru."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Seeing Uluru in person is an absolute must for anyone. It is truly a spectacular experience and you can understand why the traditional land owners hold it with such a spiritual significance. I knew it would be special but it exceeded our expectations and is something we will remember forever.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is as spectacular to see face to face as expected! And the good thing re Covid - it is not crowded!!!! See it sunrise, see it at sunset, walk around it, sit and look, see it from a camel - just SEE IT, you won't get sick of it. Truly spectacular lump of earth. Due to Covid the info booths etc weren't open - but that was fine. Yes there are flies - but a $7 flynet solves that problem!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ok, I admits, I hate flies. So you can imagine how I felt being swarmed by the little things. Apparently they are worse at certain times of the year. But if you get up early then you miss the worst of it, and to be honest the early mornings are the best time in that area. Peaceful, and the colours changing on the landscape is incredible."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Don't come to Uluru or Yulara at present. The park is closed and we are being drip-fed information so we have no idea when we will be let in. We have wasted money the past two days on expensive accommodation and car hire for no purpose. They only give short term daily updates to keep you hanging here on a string and hope that the park 'might' open tomorrow. We are being used as pawns in a power game between voyages travel, the park rangers, the police and the Originals; pretending that the park is closed due to some people attending a conference being from Sydney .... yet they are all happily busy with their conference all day while genuine park visitors are locked out. They are creating baseless fears and punishing tourists. It's a possessive power play. Best to get a refund."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Be inspired by the natural beauty and geological wonder of this region. It's scenery and mystique goes on forever.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The sunset at Uluru is awesome. The changing colors are fascinating. This monolith is special and not only at sunset. We joined an interpretive walk and heard more about the Aboriginal culture. It was very interesting. We also walked to cultural sites where we could see the ancient artwork. Uluru should not be missed when travelling in the center.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The first siting from the plane is exciting. Then I took a walk from the resort to the small lookout and was again excited to see it in the distance. We had dinner under the stars and watched the sun set over both Uluru and Kata Tjuta. The next morning up bright and early to watch the sunrise over Uluru. How amazing to be part of this. The group was generally silent as we watched in awe.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We landed into Uluru and did the 2 day tour. First day - group meet and drive over to Uluru to do the base walk, it’s hot and sandy with flies everywhere. Don’t let this out you off. Fly nets for your face/head can be purchased in the gift shop. That evening you drive to a spot to see sundown and have dinner (veggie or meat option) and watch the sun setting onto Uluru. You then go to camp, there’s a toilet and shower block plus safe storage for your cases. We had a sleeping bag and over bed thing but it was so warm I slept out with it open and didn’t get bitten ( I normally attract them in their droves) We went for a walk before bed to see the stars - wow!! I’ve never seen the Milky Way before and above my head was a clear sky full of stars twinkling. 💜 Second day is an early start as you watch the sunrise coming up behind Uluru. Once the sun has risen you head off to Kata Tjuta for a climb before heading back to the airport. The tour is very spiritual, you break away from normal life and it’s a worthwhile trip to listen about how sacred Uluru is to the aboriginals. Loved every moment and everyone should visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,An amazing place to visit. You can drive around the rock if you have your own car or a hire car but I highly recommend the Segway tour which I have reviewed on Tripadvisor. The sights of this rock whether close up or far away from the numerous lookouts is amazing especially during sunrise and sunset.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We really enjoyed seeing the aboriginal art work & the rock at sunset was stunning . We were just lucky to be able to enter for free at present as we are travelling on a tight budget & would not have paid the entry fee as it’s just to expensive when all your doing is looking at a landmark 😧
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow! What a magical place to visit. The very surreal big rock is definitely a sight to see. When I visited they had just stopped the climbing of the rock for sacred reasons. I don't think there is a need to climb it to enjoy it. There are great tracks around the base, and you are so close the another rock formation to explore. If you are keen to see the top, be sure to book a helicopter scenic flight. On a side note, the guys at the airport were great to deal with, and they do a wonderful job representing Australia to the huge amount of international visitors they get! Well done!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is the perfect time for Australians to explore Australia. There are some great deals! Uluru has always been on the list, and it’s amazingly affordable now. It’s size is hard to grasp and the feeling when you’re there makes you quiet. You feel strange talking and filling that silence. Be respectful of where you are and enjoy the surroundings. It is important to watch out for the temperatures as the heat is unfriendly and almost impossible to stay hydrated. Take a hut and definitely sunscreen. Even if you’re not able to walk because of capability or heat, you can drive all the way around it and stay in an air conditioned vehicle to enjoy the sunset or sunrise. It’s great to get out and walk on the red dirt though if you can!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,excellent time of the year to go weather was great very magical place glad I went and would recommend it to anyone
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you don't like it here you need to take a good hard look at yourself. Uluru is simply stunning, walk around it, cycle or drive it's beautiful from all angles. Having been here before and fortunate to have climbed it twice before it's a pity that has been taken away from everyone. The Red Centre is beautiful on so many levels and Kata Tjuta also has some amazing walks particularly the Valley of the Winds however, this is not particularly possible for those who are unfit or the elderly. Be prepared for the climate as you are in the desert and it can change quickly with temperatures plummeting at any stage. After 18 months travelling it was the first time I had to seek my doona and long pants and jumpers."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Hi there, Few days ago my wife and myself visited Uluru. Words can’t describe the feel and the beauty, you will experience. We did the sunrise tour and the colours were changing consistently. Just amazing!!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Seeing the rock up close, from afar, at sunrise, sunset, from above, from a camel and from every angle as you circumnavigate is so much more incredible in person than seeing it in photos. It's one of those overly familiar images but is so much more once you're there and is truly the heartbeat of Australia."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We completed base walk and enjoyed so much peace and tranquillity of the place. Went all the way around and to a few waterholes. It was a highlight of our outback adventure.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What can you say about this amazing breathtaking location. Without doubt one of the most mind blowing spots on earth. We walked around the base and the kids minds were blown hahah Ticked off bucket list
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Everyone knows Ayers Rock is big. No one’s imagination can envisage just how big. It is simply awesome and not in the meaning a teenager would apply. The colours change as the day progresses. You could sit and take photos until your finger hurt. The sunset viewing point is wonderful. At the moment there is no competition for great spots. Sunrise is worth seeing too. It is not as big but it is very special.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"With only a small number of tourist, present, it was fantastic to take in the whole environment around Uluru."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Been to the Rock, Ayers Rock, Uluru many times and it always never ceases to amaze me. I must say how wonderful the custodians and rangers have made this adventure so interesting and comfortable. Extremely clean toilets and amenities. Places to fill up your drink bottles with fresh water, excellent signage and walkways. Many places are closed at the moment due to the Pandemic, but that does not matter as this wonderful heart of Australia stands boldly firm showing that Mother Nature is always in control. Make sure you see sunrise and sunset and you will really see the many colours and energy of this majestic icon."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow, wow, wow is all I can say! An absolutely spectacular place to visit & a must do! So much to see from caves, paintings & beautiful scenery with stories of the people who lived there along the way. To see Uluru, words cannot describe & photos do no justice at all. The short walks are easy & well worth it. The 10.6km walk took 3 hours, easy to do as no rocks & a great walking track but very long. You definitely see a lot more. A fly net is advised & Good walking shoes!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One of our highlights on our visit to Australia and it did not dissapoint,we watched the sunset in the evening and the sunrise the next morning and saw the rock in all its colours.The trip in the evening is big business with loads of coaches and hundreds of people eating and enjoying the rock.The sunrise was a lot quieter with fewer people and no food so we had a better view. You used to be able to climb the rock but that has been stopped now so you can touch it and look at the paintings but you can not climb it now."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Saw close up and at a distance, sunset and sunrise. Changes in colours and atmospehre at different times of day is wonderful."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"In the cool of the air, with the blackness turning to white, the rock dances from nothing to something to red, maybe brown, maybe orange. Feel the vastness, listen to emptiness, and just try and comprehend ""where am I"" A visit of more than a day is best - plenty to see. Be mindful of the flies and the heat. A sunrise and sunset are rewarding - if you get the moon rising over the rock, on a clear evening you are lucky. The rock is a popular tourist attraction and is worth the visit. Sensible shoes, plenty of water - not ideal in summer. Follow the rules, respect the land, and relax."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The photos you see don’t do it justice versus seeing it up close. There is one section of the rock where photography is not permitted due to tribal religious aspects. The distance around is 7 miles and can take 2-3 hours to walk. Surface is relatively flat with several advantage points to view such as the Mutitjula waterhole. If you don’t do the entire walk, you can probably find a tour that will take you to this area. If you do plan to walk around the entire base, go very early in the morning before the sun gets too intense. Take plenty of water, snacks, sunscreen, and hat, wear good walking shoes and above all fly nets since there are no stores in this area. Tours are offered to view the sunrise and sunset as well. When we were there the weather was not cooperating and the sunrise and sunset views were not that great. However, there was a small break in the cloud cover and when the sun appeared you can see the colors shift on the rock as the sun went down. There were also artists in the area selling their wares when we were there for the sunset viewing. Climbing is no longer permitted. TIP ON FLY’S: Take fly nets and place the fly net over a wide hat so the netting has separation from your face. THE FLY’S ARE EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE AND AWFUL. Someone mentioned that Skin So Soft works and the fly’s stay away. This is not true, even fly repellent did not work. Our tour guide indicated that nothing works, but fly nets make it a bit more tolerable."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Visited as part of a 5 day tour. Our guide provided many of the stories that related to the areas we visited. Good to see the closure of the climbing of the rock and allow tourists to visit and explore and support the traditional owners of the land.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is fascinating as well as beautiful and stunning beyond compare. The impressive rock formation jutting up in the middle of nearly flat land for hundreds of miles around is a sight that has to be seen to be appreciated and should not be missed! Appearing differently in all lights and times of day, it's fascinating to see anytime - and we were impressed at sunrise and sunset and also at all other times of the day. We couln't get enough of Uluru and just kept taking more pictures from every different angle in the ever-changing light. Don't miss Uluru!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My sponsors sent me here for 5 days i left on the second day it was an absolute waste of time. I stayed at the main hotel and was blown away as to how bad the food was i don't know where to start?? Still doing dreadful buffet service, frozen fish frozen everything, microwaved everything, dirty tables, stained carpets, staff only interested in their phones, a failed telemarketer trying to pass as a exec chef barley having the ability to defrost and microwave. Tasteless frozen store bought packaged veggies & pasta, frozen pastries?? And this is the 5 star?? Baby veg, $11 drinks and buffet service stopped trending many years ago. I talked to one of the staff while i was having breakfast i asked her why is everything frozen and canned? She said that's just normal, maybe its poor management or just a chef with no qualifications and no ability just likes wearing the hat. Then we move outside and learn there's nothing to do here why even leave the room. Sure there are a number of tours and outdoor activities but they are very expensive and expect to be surrounded by hordes of old people that do nothing but complain about the heat and only want to head back to their hotel as fast as possible. Do your research and maybe think about spending your hard earned money somewhere else."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru each day of our stay - sunsets as part of the Filed of Lights dinner and on our own and sunrise for the Maya walk and self exploring. Uluru is massive. As we had a rental car, we were able to drive the perimeter and explore various areas. As the light plays off the rocks Uluru reflect light differently depending on the time of day. Lots to do here than just tour bus in once ..."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We recently did this with AAT Kings - this is a very spiritual place especially for the indiginous people who are in charge of it. We saw sun rise and sunset with a rainbow with the former. We were impressed with organisation of our tour and the culture stories that were retold. It was hot and the flies were many but that didnt stop us from soaking up the atmosphere of this magical place. I recommend this as a one in a lifetime experience and one we were glad to enjoy
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you are in the area, of course this is a must do. Must likely you need to go in an organized tour or with an authorized transportation company. Lots of restrictions to enter the park on your own."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I can’t believe it took me so long to visit this wonderous, nurturing and spiritual place! I highly recommend visiting and doing the two hour walk around the base. Make sure you pack a fly net though - they are out in force."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great place, the rock is amazing and must be seen. The red sands of the national park is beautiful. Not much wild. Life to be Seen other than in the parks due to the heat this time of year. Prepare to be bombarded by more flies than you have ever imagined. The flies are a pain in the butt, but they add to the experience. Local people are all so friendly and nice. Food and things are very expensive but there is an IGA that has reasonable prices. Indiginous art and artifacts prices are off the scale for. Pricing. Pack your wallet for this adventure."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Loved, loved, loved the outback and Uluru. Went to both the sunrise and sunset tours to watch the colors of Uluru change. Beautiful. Definitely took tons of photos"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"First visited Uluru 12 years ago and was keen to bring my OH there. On this occasion we'd driven down from Alice Springs so were independent transport-wise. Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park doesn't disappoint and we got some lovely views. However, on this visit the flies were unbelievable. Maybe mid-February isn't a good time as I've no recollection of these pests in November 2007."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"In addition to paying the $25 perk permit fee, thankfully we spent $49 on the Uluru hop on hop of bus. Personally I felt it was a very expensive 3 day trip - flights to Ayers Rock, hotel accommodation, food and drink. The spectacular thing about the place is the flies and without a fly net you will have a very healthy protein diet. The place has history and you can get a lot of information on line. We did a short walk from Mutitjulu waterhole to Kantju Gorge and then boarded the bus back to the hotel. If doing the long walk, carry water and note the location of the toilets. Unfortunately did not feel the fascination that other tourist have for this place. I believe fewer tourists are visiting after they stopped the rock climb, but it is not an activity I would have paid to participate in."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,SEIT Uluru Highlights - the sunrise tour with Ellie was incredible! Ellie was knowledgeable and incredibly informative. The three hour tour started with a sunrise breakfast on SEIT’s private area and its incredible view to the East of the sunrise and Kata Tjuta and Uluru to the west.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you visit the NT - Alice Springs, it’s imperative that you see this amazing sight! We went around 9:30am in the morning and it was still very hot but cooler than it would have been later in the day. We missed the 7:45am bus from our hotel but had the whole bus to ourselves! This time of year the temp soars to almost 40° which makes it difficult to walk the entire base path when you have to carry a 2 yr old + camera equipment + plus a backpack full of water and snacks. One downside was the sheer volume of flies that were everywhere! Unless you take a fly net to wear over your face you will be shooing them away every 2 seconds and won’t enjoy what you came to look at in the first place. They have now stopped visitors from climbing Uluru which I feel was the right thing to do. The stories our bus driver told us about people who climbed Uluru and what they did up there is tragic and also quite disgusting. Go there and just marvel at this awesome natural wonder of Australia! Take plenty of water though!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This tour picked us up at our hotel (Sails in the Desert) at 6:30 PM and, after a short drive to, we debarked and did a short uphill walk to a viewpoint where one could see both Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Had canapés and champagne ( or wine or beer) and a social session whiledwe watched the sunset over Kata Tjuta. We then walked down to dining area with fully appointed tables and an excellent buffet dinner with wine or beer included with a selection of desserts, coffee or tea and an excellent port. The lights were all turned off and we were treated to spectacular view of the heavens while an astronomer described what we were seeing. Bussed back to the hotel about 10:30 PM. A little pricey at $225 per person but a good value."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A fantastic base walk tour. Learning about the history, background and beliefs was fascinating. Our tour guide (Ryan) was very knowledgable and passionate about the tour and narrated the stories with energy. We loved every minute. Thank you."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"OMG it’s fantastic and its awesome with the sunset. It does get busy tho. If you walk around during the day. Water, hat & fly net. It’s a must lol Highly recommend"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A must for any Aussie or overseas visitor to see we hired a car and drove out to see the rock words cannot express the magnificent sand beauty of this piece of Aussie history.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We had the pleasure of doing a Luxuryescapes trip to Uluru we were picked up by AAT Kings at the airport Aaron was the driver who was extremely amazing So funny so welcoming and very informative Totally professional giving us impeccable info He also got us back to the airport Thank you Aaron Then we had another tour with Dylan and kyla from Nz Awesome trip Great info from Kyla on cultures Dylan very funny and good driver thank you both Last not least we had the barby and star gazing with Ivan and the boysOmg great food with love made So awesome Thank you all you are the best ambassadors of Australia to all the tourist Please let these guys know Cheers Elizabeth and Roland from Cronulla
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a great few days in Ayers Rock. Was the beginning of our tour. A number of local excursions. Got to learn about the long vast history and enjoy the beautiful sites. If you visit in summer months, be sure to invest in a net to cover your head. Flys are terrible but do not bite. Nets keep them away from face and you really get used to them elsewhere. Got to see all the can't miss sites and enjoy some great local food."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So much to see and the colour moods in different timings unbelievable beautiful. I advise to wear a fly net when walking . Go very early morning , because after 8 am gets very hot in summer. I went twice in summer best time to see the rock in different colour shades"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This should be on everyone's bucket list to visit as photos do not reveal just how special this place is. The wife and I did the sunrise segway tour which takes you all the way round the rock and is well worth doing.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We enjoyed the Uluru Sunrise & Kata-Tjuta gorge trip with excellent AATKings guides Jacob & Aaron. The Sounds Of Silence dinner was actually a bbq (no canapés or coffee offered) with an Astrology talk on the really clear night was, nonetheless, very good."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Most iconic place in the outback of Australia, if this is not in your bucket list, you are missing out!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We were part of a tour. We came to a sunrise and 2 sunsets. The 2nd sunset was perfect making the rock formation glow. People waiting for the right moment for their photos were in a festive mood on all 3 occasions. Once you realize mid-day is very hot outside, it’s quite enjoyable to be outside in the early and late parts of the day."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"(Written by my 12 year old son Joe) It was lovely and calm with the desolate landscape. The sunset was beautiful showing off the different colours of Ayers Rock, from a pale red to orange to a darker red and the glowing sun disappearing behind Uluru just made the night perfect. The stargazing trip showed me the real beauty of the night sky with all the patterns of stars and it was very special when we got to look through telescopes and see Mars. Next morning watching the sunrise with my hot chocolate and biscuits in hand was amazing. The desert glowed a stunning orange letting out its magnificence when the sun rose. Walking through the caves and seeing the aboriginal art was magical. As you look closer at the art you can see how each painting means something different by telling a story or showing a moral. Learning about how simple their life style was and how they could only count to four truly shocked me. There are tour guides you can hire to show you around or you can simply wander at your own pace. You can hire a car or take a bus and drive around Ayers Rock to see the different formations and angles of the rock face. It really is important to do this as all the angles of the rock are different. You can hire a car or a bus from the market square in Uluru.The market square was loads of fun as there were a variety of small shops selling little ornaments and my 2 brothers and I played the didgeridoo and had a laugh as all of us failed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is spectacular, rising out of the totally flat desert it's monolithic size leaves you stunned. The vibe here is just amazing. Walking/bike riding the base is a must. If walking is a challenge for you the road does go around the base and you can stop, park and do a short walk into the points of interest. The waterhole is a must as at start. People come here to enjoy the silence so keeping noise down would be considerate. The cultural centre is well worth stopping in for. Take plenty of water, and checking the weather for temperatures to choose a cooler day is a good idea. It's a desert dry heat. Also, pack a fly net to go over your hat, sometimes there are lots of flies which become annoying. Tips are book a 7 day stay as there are lots of other sites to visit such as Kata Tjuta and Kings Canyon, and hire a car - the roads are a very easy drive. This is an amazing life experience for kids too."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Appreciate the enormity of the rock by walking around it. The desert colours are so vivid. Choose a cooler day as it can ghet hot. Take sun cream and a hat and water.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,See my review for the park as a whole. I cant explain but she makes you feel. Broight me to tears the minute i got oit of the car
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"traveled there for the christmas holiday; the excursions that were offered were incredible. One of the most incredible parks and views. Clean, well kept and happy people are no longer climbing the rock"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Guides, Aaron, Jacob and Ree, were very professional. They were well trained in first aide (it was needed by 2 people) and knowledgeable about the different features of Uluru. They made sure everyone kept up and the safety of the passengers were given a high priority by them all. The bus was well equipped with plenty of water and toilet facilities."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Lovely and calm with a beautiful landscape. A real glimpse of the Australia outback and it’s majesty.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A very memorable trip to Uluru and Kata Tjuta was a highlight of our Red Centre Experience. I was amazed and impressed with the ever changing colours of the rock and the Olgas. I preferred the Olgas but wouldn't go there without exploring both. The sunrise and sunset visits were well worth the effort but be early for both to get a prime position. I did not go there to climb the rock. It was a very steep looking climb.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is definitely one of the must see things to put on your bucket list. Such a majestic sight with lots of things to learn and see about the Aboriginal culture. The resorts are well set out, and plenty of tours to do. I would recommend a car if travelling with more than two people as it’s cheaper and you have a lot more flexibility."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our Globus tour included a cocktail and canape party while watching the sunset on Uluru/Ayers Rock - beer, pop and champagne, veggies, fruit, cheese, crackers, chips,dips, etc. Our bus driver provided canvas camp stools to sit on. Endless tour buses and vehicles cram in the sunset viewing area parking lot, so get there early to claim a good spot by the fence for best views and photo taking. Different shading occurs as the sun sets, and surprisingly how fast."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Even from a distance this rock takes your breath away. Call it magic, standing here at the base of Uluru, you know you're on sacred ground. Certain parts of the rock are open to the public, heed the signage warning no photos beyond this point. Climbing the rock is against the law since October 2019. So photogenic you won't be able to stop shooting photos. Rather than a right, it's a privilege to experience this ancient, spiritual place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru was probably the only reason we wanted to come to the Red Center. We took a guided tour from Alice Springs and were not disappointed, despite the long day (19 hours of travel). The rock itself showed us its numerous faces, colors and vibes, and we managed to visit it and its surrounding for a good 7 hours, with a nice BBQ as the sun was setting on this magnificent rock. Don't miss it - but make sure to bring your flies-net with you!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Privilege to see. Spectacular natural wonder that looks different almost every time you look. Did base walk and was captivated. The gorge my favourite spot. I went anti clockwise just after dawn and it was amazing to experience more than one sunrise in a day. Almost a MUST do experience.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had hired a car as it’s so much easier to get around and ended up being cheaper than the hop on/off bus for 2 people. We got to Uluru for 7.30am. Unfortunately our visit to Yulara coincided with a heatwave which affected our ability to do everything we wanted to do. If I was to go again I would probably go around September. As we drove up to the rock we looked at each other in amazement at the sheer size of it. We had no idea how big it was and no words can describe the colours of the rock. We got so carried away with photos that it took us 30 mins to do the first km. The walk itself is not hard. It’s flat. However the heat was really bad. They say to drink 1 litre of water per hour and I can see why. The heat radiates off the sand and there is very little shade along the path. It was saying it was only 32deg at 8.00am but it felt like 40deg to me. There was a shelter around 2 kms in but no water. We had to get to the half point shelter to get water. I was surprised they didn’t have water at each rest station. Along the way there were beautiful parts to take photos but they were prohibited for cultural reasons as they were deemed sensitive spots. I think we chose the right way to go around anticlockwise as it had the nice views at the beginning like the rock art, caves and gorge. By the time we got to the end of the 10km walk I wasn’t even looking at the last couple of kms as it was so hot I just wanted to get to the end. It took us 2 hours and 40mins to finish and we were stopping to enjoy the views and took loads of photos along the way. However if you are there during the warmer months you need to start the walk around 6.00 - 6.30am as it can get uncomfortably hot. On the plus side we did not need our fly nets at all during all of our stay at Yulara. Must have been too hot for the flies and there were not that many tourists. As Australians this was a must do for us. You definitely felt like you were in the presence of something spiritual and I don’t tend to believe in that sort of thing but I can definitely understand why this is such a sacred place for the Aboriginals."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My husband and I visited this amazing site in December 2019. It was breathtaking,for someone who really didn't want to go I was completely taken by its enormity and beauty.we did a sunset tour and it was recommended to take pictures every 5 minutes due to the different colouring of the rock as the sun is going down .i would definitely recommend anyone coming out here to do this tour ,also the helicopter flight taking you over part of the rock and the olgas .this also was an amazing experience.we loved every minute of our time out there"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I suggest you going there in morning and avoid coming at afternoon. They closed for safety reason. Bring a hat and lot of water
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"-As you are on this webpage, you will need to look at other topics on Trip Advisor to get more precise information for a visit to Uluru/Kata Tjuta National Park (because Uluru covers a multitude of sites/activities). However, having just returned from 5 days there, here is a collection of hopefully helpful pieces of information for those going there. -as at least most Australians know, during our lifetimes the name of the area has been changed from Ayres Rock to Uluru. Notwithstanding this, the resort there is called Ayres Rock Resort. -you need to pay ($25) for a pass into the Uluru national park. Its easiest to buy this online at the Parks Australia website .The national park has manned entrances and you will be asked to show your park pass, even if you are on a commercial bus tour. Its easiest to download it to your phone.The money clearly goes to good use. Apart from maintaining the park, guides need to be be accredited before they can take you on a tour. This is good for everyone, because it means you have a very knowledgeable guide. -while you are at the Australian government website for Uluru National Park, suggest you also download maps of it and Kata Tjuta which will be very useful when you visit them. The maps also mark areas you are asked by the local people not to photograph. Ironically, because their sensitivity to this cannot be disclosed to outsiders, the Catch 22 is not even government accredited guides can explain the reasons. (photo of a sign attached). - when you get to the Ayres Rock Resort which is the hub for the many forms of accomodation for viewing Uluru- from 5 star hotels to camping grounds- you will be given a booklet called ""Manta"" (meaning welcome in a local language). Only while writing this report I discovered this informative booklet is available online- it is most useful for you in the planning stage so google ""Manta- Insider's guide to Uluru"" to get a copy to download. Almost as useful as Trip Advisor (actually will give you many topics to search on it). -Uluru National park can be explored in several ways offered by many tour companies eg walk, segway, motorbike, air (plane & helicopter). If you get a window seat, you may even get a great panorama of the area as your commercial plane comes in to land! Also some of friends felt the highlight was taking a parachute jump over the site!. -the 2 major bus tour companies for seeing the sites in the Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park are SEIT and AAT. I preferred the former because they use 11 seater Mercedes minivans. AAT uses full size buses, which obviously cannot go off road like the SEIT vehicles eg to Mt Conner. However, AAT seems to have a monopoly on visiting the much hyped ""Fields of Light""/""Sounds of Silence""-in my opinion, overhyped & overpriced and thus missable. If you only have one night free, far more informative and amazing is to see the stars of the great southern sky above Australia as you have probably never seen them - because the air out here is pure with no city lights or pollution. (Look for ""Astro Tours"" at resort) -in addition to using Trip Advisor and Manta for your forward planning, also suggest on your first day at resort visit Tourist Information Centre in its central town square. Most tour operators have a booth there. -in terms of planning, I highly recommend you plan to spend at least 3 full days on the ground at Ayres Rock Resort (and days on either end to come/go). {You will be very isolated if you stay @ Longitude 131 ( although it has all inclusive prices (ie includes tours) but it is OTT expensive, Have friends who have stayed at both, but based on their prior comments choose to stay in the resort. The resort is far larger and you will meet a great cross section of people plus be at the hub for tours. Also, you can use all the facilities of all the resort hotels but charge everything back to your room . - At least 3 days will allow you to spend a full day exploring each of what are essentially 3 very different but huge rock formations. The 2 famous one are Uluru and Kata Tjuta (which are also listed as UNESCO World Heritage Natural wonders). On the third day, head for the little known Mt Conner - a ""mesa"" rather than a ""monolith"" like the others. Only SEIT has tours there. Alternatively, you can view it from Mt Conner Station which is worth a visit in itself because it is a working1 one million acre cattle station. - a recently started attraction -(at the Camel Farm ,about a 5min drive from the resort)- is called Red Desert Reptiles. Highly recommended. -Uluru is serviced by a broad range of hospitality types, from high end hotels (Longitude 131 and Sails) to backpacker accomodation and camping grounds. Note that Longitude 131 is in an area by itself and is what Americans would call a gated community. Its great advantage is direct views of Uluru, but as usual you pay for location. All the other hotels and hospitality options are in an area called Ayres Rock Resort. All the tourists and hospitality workers form a pleasant small town (called Yulara)- which is listed as the 4th biggest town in the Northern Territory! -Note that Uluru is visible from various sites in the resort and several lookouts within a few minute walk of it., but not hotel rooms (except at Desert Gardens & Longitude 131). -If you do only one guided tour- and the guides all have to accredited by the local people and the government, do the SEIT sunrise base walk of Uluru. Otherwise it and AAT have bus tours around Uluru. What you learn on such tours in terms of the spirituality and mythology of the local people + the geology and ecology of the whole national park will be useful where ever else you go in the vast national park. -all the hotels comprising the Ayres Rock Resort are operated by the highly regarded international Accor group. One of its attractions I have learnt after staying with them for over 20 years all over the world is that apart from being leaders in the hospitality field, they classify their hotels so you know what you are getting eg in size of room/public areas/service etc. Unfortunately, at Uluru the hotels are not branded in their names in the usual Accor way. However, applying the Accor branding system of names to the hotels comprising Ayres Rock Resort, you would get the following results: Sails = Pullman Desert Gardens = Novotel The Lost Camel = Mercure Outback Pioneer = Ibis The resort is also marketed by its indigenous owners under the brand ""Voyages"" Ayres Rock Resort and you are most likely to end up at its booking site or call centre. Based on my experience with them and Accor, as a friendly call centre person from Accor told me , Accor (unlike in my experience with ""Voyages"") uses ""dynamic pricing"". The magic words are to ask/search for the Accor ""prepaid rate"". This saved me over $100pn compared to the price Voyages quoted for the same hotel/dates/room type. Voyages refused to even attempt to match the Accor prepaid rate- but obviously you have to prepay. Although I am not member, I also understand if you join Accor's loyalty program, you can get another 10% off its rates. -although the resort covers a large area, there is a shuttle bus around it. Highly recommended is spending one evening at the Outback Pioneer where there is usually a large BBQ and the fun company of backpackers from all over the world. -Although not publicised - for obvious reasons?- staying at the resort allows you to participate in many free activities for guests (which third party tour operators charge for similar); including (@ Wintjiri Museum (near resort town centre) displays and talks about history ecology of area and its connections to the spirituality and mythology of the local people; tours explaining bush tucker and medicine; astronomy talks including viewing the sun!! and amazing views of the southern sky free of city lights/pollution and you can also even learn to play a didgeridoo (to the point of creating a noise!!)- see attached photo of our enthusiastic instructor. -Note that if you bring only one pair of boots/walking shoes, make sure they have gripping soles because only the area around Uluru is sand. Even Australia's famous RM Williams stockman boots (which I had) are useless on the gravel around Kata Tjuta because their smooth soles do not grip (so you will be slip/sliding as you walk). Also don't make the mistake of being at any of the sites between 11am-3pm; the heat will be 35C+ and probably actually be greater because of the built up radiant heat from the ground and cliff like walls of Uluru/Kata Tjuta (although unlike Asia in such temperatures, there is no humidity). 2 INSIDER TIPS; 1.Some reviewers complain about the flies/wear mesh nets over their heads (which obviously give you a strange view of scenery about you). Far better than usual Australian fly repellents, go to the newsagent in the resort town centre and get a cream called ""Desert Dwellers""- it is what the locals use and will save you giving the ""Australian Salute"" all the time (=waiving your arms to swat away flies).2. Contrary to some statements elsewhere, at least in the case of Avis, it cost the same to rent a car at Ayres Rock airport as in town. It is difficult to get lost from the resort as there is only one highway by it- one direction goes to Mt Conner/Curtin Springs Station and the other to Kata Tjuta/Uluru. TO CONFIRM THE OBVIOUS-ULURU CLIMB IS CLOSED; the Uluru climb is now definitely shut as requested by the indigenous people. The climb area at its start (see attached photo) now (almost) resembles a scene from North Korea. A ranger told me they definitely have it under CCTV surveillance in case a yobbo tries to climb it. ENGLISH vs INDIGENOUS NAMES. Trip Advisor has entries under Ayres Rock and The Olgas for the main attractions in the National Park. For decades these have been officially called by their indigenous names of Uluru and Kata Tjuta; so bear that in mind when doing your searches, because there is a lot of overlap because of the same places being described by either their English or indigenous names. More importantly, they are all unique and fantastic places to visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We arrived Monday and left Friday, stayed at Sails, did the: Field of Lights, a Segway tour of the Rock, Kings Canyon tour, a helicopter flight out to the Rock and the afternoon Camel Tour, plus a lot of just wandering around. The entire experience was exceptional, everyone from tour guides to bus drivers, ground staff, waiters, desk staff and simply everyone we met was friendly and helpful. The place was great, the tours excellent and the whole experience just wonderful. It did cost a bit for the week, but given the remote locality and experience we were very happy with the total cost (no point going to one of the world’s greatest natural wonders and not experiencing it). The weather was hot when we were there (the day at Kings Canyon was 45 degrees), but everyone was very safety conscious and adjusted accordingly. Totally worth spending some time there."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Absolutely stunning anytime of the day , such well kept lands and I’m glad their protecting there heritage , would recommend a tour xx"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"July is a great time to visit No flies, cool enough to walk all day 24 Max each day, no mozzies....perfect! The rock is amazing even from first glimpse You can extend the usual 3 day pass at no extra cost by plugging in your longer dates...so no need to buy consecutive passes Hire a car for max flexibility especially with kids. The total price ends up being cheaper for a family. Roads easy to get around and get to photo sights before crowds The walks are fairly easy and car means you can do olgas etc at your leisure Note do the sunrise view from the base walk, the viewing platform doesn't catch the best angle Bring wine with you to yulara as 6 bottles is free to carry in the cabin on Qantas Wine selection otherwise is ordinary If you like something special do The tali wiru degustation dinner....wow is all I can say Sounds of silence good too but for mum and dad romance definitely do tali with ( beautiful dune)"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,So wonderful to visit Uluru. It is entirely breathtaking. So familiar to most Australians but wonderful to see up close. To be able to wander around the rock with the rock walls looming above you is quite remarkable. A truely spiritual and significant place
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We spent about 4 hours over two days enjoying the sites in Uluru and the huge rock (6 miles around). We had a great tour guide, and I’d highly recommend having one, and he did an outstanding job explaining the culture and the meaning of this wonderful place. There is not much else to do in this location, but the rock itself is worth the trip and I’d love to return again. The weather was fine while we were there, but I’d love to see the place at night on a clear night."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It has to be said that this rock is a pretty unique looking thing. And the fact that it seems mostly surrounded by not much else at all makes it all the more striking. The sheer size of it really hits you as you approach. Even having seen it in my youth it did impress me all over again and the rich colouring was great to look at and to observe at sunset. Now obviously the area can be very hot so you have to use your head and plan your trip time. And take a fly/bug net and a hat and carry your own supply of water if you plan on walking about. Be aware that the sunset viewing area can get busy - as can the sunrise viewing area logically enough. There are not a lot of amenities there but that isn't such a drastic issue - a trip to the cultural centre should also be part of your visit. The downside is the time taken to get there. There are a few other points of interest such as Kings Canyon but otherwise the surrounding terrain is fairly uninspiring. And if you're on a driving holiday then you really will be sick of the scrubby brush and rocky terrain after the first few hundred kilometres. There are a range of places to stay nearby but make sure you book ahead as the places can fill up. Thankfully they are a short drive away so the view of the rock isn't messed up by nearby tourist eyesores and the developments have been kept low-rise. My suggestion would be to check it out in the morning - perfect way to avoid the head. And if you plan on walking or cycling around it do so then. And then pop back out again in the evening for a sunset viewing.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We stayed at the Sail in the desert hotel. The resort is well equipped and we enjoyed great service there. Joined a couple of activities including a night at field of the lights, Kata Tjuta sunrise and valley of the winds hike, Uluru sunrise with Segway and the Uluru sunset drive. Views are beautiful but the heat is almost unbearable in summer time. And flies are everywhere. Activities and foods are pricey there which is understandable in the middle of desert. Worth a visit overall!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This review is geared more to foreign visitors and is based on a caravan experience I had back in July, from Alice Springs to Uluru and Kings Canyon. I certainly understand the cultural significance of Uluru to Australians and don't want to take that away from them. But for foreign tourists wanting to visit a desert area on a driving tour, you might be better off going to the US. The rock itself is interesting but for me paled in comparison to the natural wonders of, say, Grand Canyon, Zion, or even Death Valley national parks. Mainly the sheer size of the rock formations in these parks are much more impressive than Uluru, as are the elevation changes, for example from 7000 feet from the rim to 2000 feet at the bottom of the grand canyon, a the canyon being several miles wide in parts. In addition when traveling through the US desert you are crossing a series of mountains and canyons, which provide impressive vistas of the surrounding terrain. The portion of the outback near Uluru, on the other hand, is mostly flattish terrain with heavy brush, so you can't see much from the roadside. Frankly, it's a boring drive from Alice Springs, except maybe the first few times you see a road train passing by. One more thing, US deserts for the most part don't have a lot of insects. In Uluru, at least in the wintertime, there are some nasty flies. Bug nets required. If you decide to go caravaning in the area, check if there are any school holidays, which can increase congestion significantly, and make caravan park reservations harder to get. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my Australian holiday, and definitely liked Cairns and Sidney. I also liked Kings Canyon, which I think is a worthy stop if you are in the area and actually liked better than Uluru. However I'm not sure the driving effort was worth it, overall."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"View from above or from little airplane is beautiful. However, because the flight try to get as close as possible so everyone of us get can the better view 50% of as get sick and vomiting. Thanks"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To see Uluru for the first time almost takes your breath away, it is amazing. We saw a sunset and a sunrise over Uluru with the sunset taking the prize for the best in terms of colour. It is big. We were lucky to be able to climb Uluru a few days before it closed, it was arduous! It was shocking to see parents with unstrapped young children climbing. I understand why the climbing has stopped but to be on the top felt really special, privileged and one I will cherish. The random breathalyser test on the way out of the park after sunset was a first! Definitely worth a visit to see it for real as opposed to a picture. As recommended in other reviews, a head net is an absolute must if you do not like flies!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I rated this attraction as average as although I found Uluru and it's surrounds wonderful, amazing and beautiful the service I experienced at the nearby Cultural Centre created a negative overview and really let this attraction down. I visited Uluru recently in order to complete the climb to the top before it was closed as this was a ""bucket list"" item I've always wanted to do in my lifetime. I did find the organisation of the park very good with good maps, clean toilets and clearly posted signs and explanations of cultural sights etc. The first day I visited it was drizzling so the climb was closed and I instead walked around the rock and surrounds. My first negative experience occurred when I tried to buy a poncho at the Cultural Centre Shop from a woman behind the counter. She brought one out and stated that it was $5.00. I said ""5 dollars""? and hesitated as I wasn't sure that I needed it/wanted to buy it and within seconds of my response she immediately said to me quite rudely ""it's not for sale anymore"" and took it away. I was so surprised and taken aback by her response I asked her when she came back ""Sorry, did I say something wrong"" but she refused to talk to me saying ""this counter is closed"" and pointing to the nearby coffee shop saying ""you'll have to talk to them there if you want something"". 5 minutes later she was happily smiling at another older customer and selling them the poncho and I was bewildered as she had been unnecessarily rather hostile and rude to me. On the base walk it's advisable of water as there are only a couple of places to get water, one at the start and one at the other side and the walk is 10kms and takes 2 - 3 hours depending upon fitness. There is only one set of toilets at the start of the walk. The walk itself was amazing with spectacular rock formations and beautiful sights all round the rock with every facet of the rock having different colours and structure. That morning the Cultural Centre cafe had been very busy so I decided to come back later that afternoon after my walk to get lunch. I came back about maybe 3pm as I ended up taking longer than I though and the cafe was open but mostly empty. I saw a ham and cheese toastie in the glass cabinet and I asked the staff if I could have that. The response was ""Sorry No - we've turned the toaster maker off"". I said ""maybe could you just turn it on for me"". ""No - it will take too long to heat up and we don't want to have to clean it again"". I tried a couple more times to persuade them but it was to no avail. I then tried to buy an untoasted foccaccio also in the cabinet. I explained that it was okay to have it untoasted but the response was ""No - you can't have that - we don't sell it that way"". I implored a few more times to get one of the sandwiches and explained that I was so very hungry after my walk and had nothing else to eat but they were adamant they would not give me anything. I ended with a cup of tea and a cookie which is all they had apart from muffins and choclolate bars but it in no way sated me and the lack of food made me cranky and not feeling my best, The next day I came out to the park again, watched the sunrise and then climbed to to the top which was absolutely magical and amazing. It made me feel rather sad though knowing that I might never be able to climb the rock again and generations of Australians after me might not have this same experience as it was so very special and beautiful. If you can then definitely bring all your own food and other items such as raincoats etc. I feel that any staff / cafe withholding food to patrons when there's no other food providers for 20kms around is appalling. I would like to mention also that not ALL staff were unfriendly - I did meet some lovely helpful people in the resort and the park and had some great interactions with people like the bus drivers who were all uniformly wonderful. Overall because of my negative experiences and knowing I can't climb anymore I don't know if I'll ever go back. There were ""unfriendly vibes"" I received from not only staff at the Cultural Centre in the park but also the Ayers Rock Resort (specifically the Outback Pioneer Resort) which made me wonder if they really want tourists there at all and also made me want to visit a place where I was treated better and that wasn't such a rip off."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Its def worth the 2.5hrs flight from sydney - they make it so easy to get to uluru we just hired a car from the airport was cheap and worth it easy to drive and get around Dont miss the sunset over uluru its fantastic!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Toured around by the rock by segway with an informative and knowledgeable guide which was a fun way to see Uluru. It is so captivating and mesmerising and the naturally vivid colours seem to change hue at various times of the day.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We are always excited to see anything new especially a location that holds importance for a country but if we are honest we were a little underwhelmed. As far as natural wonders go it is not that impressive and seems to be a place that has been marketed to tourists as a must do destination with a monopoly creating very high prices. Glad we went and saw it but happy we are also spending some time in Alice springs area and didn’t fly in just for the rock. Also was expecting more wildlife in the area.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It certainly took my breath away when Uluru appeared out of our vast landscape. This spiritual part of our Country is a deeply personal experience and on this trip words cannot describe just how special this place is. The service and friendly staff at the Outback Pioneer Lodge was exceptional. AAT were amazing tour guides for the Uluru Base Walk, Valley of the Winds, Sunrise and Sunset Tour. I finished my three night stay with the Astro Tour looking at the stars and planets."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is our third visit and every time has been exciting! Watching the sunrise and sunset when the character of the rock changes remain unforgettable! There is simply something magical about it!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our timing to visit Uluru was just before the climb was permanently closed. When we arrived, there was a small crowd waiting for the climb to open. I opted not to do the climb out of respect for the culture, even though I've done some spectacular climbs in the past. Enjoyed the Mala Ranger walk and a walk around the entire base, which was amazing and gave wonderful and changing views throughout. The track is level and easy, but bring water and a fly net if you want to be comfortable. The views around the base are superb and there are some very cool sights to see. We took a heli flight over Uluru and Kata Tjuta, which gave us a great perspective of seeing the vast desert with this amazing formation seemingly appearing from nowhere. Definitely worth the visit and taking time to explore."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I am highly recommending Jake and the team at Mulgas. The tour was phenomenal, we had a mixed group and everyone was catered for. Jake’s passion and knowledge were unsurpassed. The treks were fantastic. Camping facilities were spot on."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Impressed by the size, and changing views, - always something different to see as you travel around, but cooler weather would make the walk much more enjoyable."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I agree with the closing of the Uluru climb. To hear that people of all cultures have been so disrespectful of such a wonderful icon has made me very sad. Its terrible that once people have reached the top that they find it necessary to deficate the area. Ie wee and I dare so pooh when they get to the top which is just appalling. I know that there are no toilets on top and it's hard to put any due to it being a monolith. But this is a good reason to close it as it has damaged a very delicate and sensitive ecosystem. Perhaps in years to come the indigenous cultural will be able to re open the climb once it has had time to repair itself. I can see a similar setup as on the Sydney Bridge climb ie booking and paying to use this facility. Also wearing sensitive protective clothing, shoes, hat etc done with an idigenous guide. With very limited numbers. Just an idea."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Hours of flying to see a rock THAT YOU CANT EVEN CLIMB! Don’t bother. It’s just not worth it. Wave Rock im WA is far better value. Uluru has Exorbitant accommodation and transfer prices to see a rock that has been photographed so much. Just look at photos online and keep your hard earned money for experiences like the Great Barrier Reef, beautiful South Australian wine country, Ningaloo etc etc."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Highlight of my trip to Australia. Enjoyed a sunset picnic with great views of the rock. The following morning went out to the rock with an excellent guide, Leroy Beachley. Excellent cultural experience! I am now reading ""Dark Emu"" which was recommended by Leroy. This book sheds important light on the native agriculture and aquaculture in Australia predating Europeans. Had only one day at this site. Wish I could have stayed longer."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Until you see Uluru with your owns eye you cant believe how magical the rock is. The colour and size is amazing. The rock stands out in the distance and as I got closer I couldn’t believe the size and beauty. The high and sheer edges can only be viewed in awe. A must see when in the Red Centre.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We Visited Uluru and Kata Tjuta, we had a Fantastic time exploring the areas. Didn't climb Uluru was happy to sit on it and take a photo. The best was taking a helicopter flight over Uluru and Kata Tjuta instead that was impressive. Would recommend to visit this beautiful monolith in The Red Centre of Australia. Just loved it❤❤"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The majesty of this place can’t be underestimated. There is a lot to see and experience here without climbing the Rock. We did a Segway tour that circumnavigated the Rock. This was a great way to get to see the whole extremity particularly on a hot day.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,An amazing place with a massive rock which does not need climbing to be appreciated. It is much bigger than we expected and quite beautiful in the changing light and colours.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,sunrise tour and hike was fantastic. sunset tour with SEIT was mediocre with spectacular views. Huge issue with flies; forced one hour visit to cultural center and gift shop was annoying.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,That was my first impression of this huge icon of Australia. SO big and takes a while to get around. I suggest early morning if you are going to walk (segway is also fun) and drink plenty of water and take a fly net.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Drove/walked/cycled around (& climbed). Dozens of photos at all times of day (particularly sunrise & sunset). Magnificent experience of nature, light and Creation. Plenty of yarns to tell. Recommend hire a car (book a month ahead of arriving) as really gave freedom, flexibility and air-conditioned solitude/relaxation with loved ones. Overheard pained stories in cafes of others missing out on wanted activities & running out of time (waiting for buses)."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This was a trip I have waited my life to do. The size and majesty of Uluru is genuinely breathtaking. It looms on the distance as you approach and then you get the real perspective of the size of it. The climb closes in a few days but to see this rock will live forever in your memory.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We drove the Red Centre Way from Alice Springs to Uluru... Entering the National Park and suddenly seeing Uluru on the left is such a magical feeling. You just know you enter a very special place. Take some time exploring all the possible activities here and definitely go on some hiking trails. The guides are very good ambassadors for this place. Sure, the place is very commercial here, but they make sure that the local tribes'"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Well worth the time to visit amazing sights and experiences a must do wow what an ancient place the olgas are just as good as Ayers Rock if not better!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visited in July 2019. Trepidation about climbing but at same time believed it belongs to all. Did the climb and found it exhilarating. Visited the ranger station first and were definitely not discouraged. Read and reviewed the cultural information and made our decision. Also experienced the sunset view which is amazing. Did the base walk of 10km, as experienced hikers enjoyed the easy walk but did not like the segways, bike groups and camel rides. These with the constant helicopters confirm that besides the climb the whole experience is just commercial. Add prices at the nearby resort town and money is everything. Not sure what impact closing the climb will have commercially because money is the current priority regardless of what is said. Media have beat up the impact of “bogan” climbers, we saw no rubbish, no tissues, no random camping and just a mass of people spending $$$."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru... what an amazing place throughly enjoyed our time out at the rock, an amazing thing to have seen"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is stunning - you just can't comprehend the vastness of it until you see it in real life. I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity and prevalance of 'greenery' around the rock. The base walk took 3 hours and although the terrain is flat / sandy, it was tough-going - it was very hot by 8.30am! We were keen to climb before the ban on 26th October and are so thrilled we had the chance to do so. Here are our tips: 1. The climb is closed far more than it is open - if the sole or primary purpose of your trip is to climb then keep your plans flexible (sod's law will guarantee that the morning you book a tour or activity will be the one day the climb is open!) and attempt the climb early in your trip. With a lot of luck you may get up on day 1/2, and will then be free to head to (for example) King's Canyon (which is also beautiful). 2. The climb is frequently closed due to weather: usually because the conditions are too hot or too windy. Mornings tend to be cool but windy (winds usually die down as the day goes on) but afternoons are often blisteringly hot with no breeze. 3. The best time to climb (both in terms of your comfort and the likelihood of the climb being open) is 7 - 8am. If the weather is forecast to hit above 36 degrees at *any* point that day, the climb will automatically be shut at 8am for the remainder of the day, and it will not re-open. (This is the case even though it might not be forecast to hit 36 degrees until 3pm). So if you are there well before 8am, the heat won't thwart your climb, but the winds still might. 4.. The climb can also be closed if rain is forecast, or if it has recently rained, or if a storm is predicted. However, these conditions would be unusual in October. 5. The rangers assess the climb conditions at 7am, 8am, 10am, 12 noon, 2pm and 4pm. So if the climb is closed in the morning it may open later, and vice versa. 6. Save the number of the Ayers Rock Resort in your phone, and at around 10 minutes past the relevant hour (see above), call and ask be put through to any of the hotels - they are updated if the climb opens or closes. 7. if you are keen to climb, you must hire a car. You absolutely will need it to make sure you can zoom off to the climb if it opens. If you are stuck on a tour schedule or beholden to the 'hop on hop off bus' (which by the way, is an absolute rip-off, and doesn't get you to Uluru before 8am unless you pay even more for the 'sunrise' bus), you may miss the climb when it's open. I'd take it as far as saying you should call your hotel from the airport tarmac to ascertain the climb status before you waste time going to drop off your cases and change - if it's open it might be your only window. 8. wear proper shoes (hiking / trekking), SPF 50, long sleeves, long comfy trousers (e.g. gym leggings), and wide brimmed hat (must have a chin strap - it's so windy up there). There's a loo and a water point at the Mala car-park - make sure you down a litre or two before heading up and take one with you in your backpack. 9. WEAR A BACKPACK. the climb involves scrambling and 'bouldering' and sliding on your bum a bit and you must keep you hands free to be able to grip the chain or break a fall if need be. 10. We are 31 and 33 and regular gymgoers. We found the climb brisk but manageable. It took us around 2.45hours return trip with 30 minutes or so at the top for photos, but we weren't in a rush so probably could have sped up a bit if need be. Hope this is helpful - we found it so hard to get information on the climb and only learnt the 'rules' about weather and needing to be there before 8am when we got to Uluru."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Visiting Uluru during my terms in Australia was very nice and I discovered a lot about life of aborigines.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is remarkable country and is understandable why it is so special to the Anangu people. There is no way to convey that sense in a photo. Definitely a bucket list place to visit.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We traveled to Alice Springs then took the 6-hour drive to Uluru. When we arrived in Uluru after the drive we decided to climb the rock as it was going to be windy the next day. It was a great experience it wasn't busy at all (surprisingly, especially since it's closing soon). It is VERY expensive everywhere a drink over $13 dollars. You must be pretty fit to climb the rock, so much harder than it looks when the chain ends there is still a further way to go. We stayed at the Outback Pioneer Lodge, very basic and unclean. We did the dinner under the stars and that was AMAZING. Wet met some beautiful people and had a lovely night. Although once you have seen the rock, nothing much else to do."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The planning, the time, the money..... but what is today’s bullsh1t excuse why the climb isn’t open, one ranger goes one way with a story, the other goes another way.....then proceeds to tell my brother “it was open between 7 and 8 yesterday” except we were there.... it was open for for 30 minutes. Big signs saying “Your safety is your responsibility” at the Olgas....but thank us because we are saving you from yourselves at the Rock. Doesn’t matter the excuse, result is the same, no climbing. It’s a power trip, it officially closes on the 26th.... but I’m telling you it’s closed now. Don’t come here expecting to climb. Don’t come here if you don’t think everything is triple the price it should be. Save your money stay home, if you want to do a 10km walk or bike ride do it around your local area and buy a postcard of the Rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is absolutely a worthwhile thing to add to your list, however the base walk is long! (3 hours for a fit young couple including short stops along the work) there are parts where there isn’t much to do other than walk (and look). We started at 7 40 in the morning and it was incredibly hot by 9am - so the last hour or so was really tough. Something to do once, and be grateful you’ve done it!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Simply outstanding - and you do not have to climb it to enjoy it. The national park pass can either be purchased online or at the manned kiosk on the drive out to the rock from Yulara. The pass is good for three days which provides plenty of time for you to see and enjoy all “the Rock” and Kata Tjuta have to offer. We went to the sunset viewing area, drove the road around the rock, went to the Visitor’s/Cultural centre and walked the base track around the Rock: allow 3-4 hours for this activity. All good. It is about a 15-20 minute drive from Yulara out to the Visitor’s Centre where you will find amenities. Toilets will also be found near the car park area where the climb commences(ed): these could be in high demand. Glad to have finally had the opportunity to visit: thoroughly worthwhile."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Need to visit at various times of the day to really appreciate this place. Sunrise, sunset - do independently - don’t have to book expensive tours to get to appreciate it, if you have your own vehicle."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Our trip to Uluru was fantastic. Our daughter suggested we use bikes to cycle around the rock and that turned out to be the best. It was 35C that day and we had a slight breeze on the bikes to make it more pleasant. We were envied by walkers as we went around. The only down side was that the hop on bus could only drop us off at the cycle pickup spot at 10am when it was already beginning to warm up. If you have your own car you can pick up the bikes at 7am for a cooler start. We did not climb Uluru out of respect for local indigenous peoples. I highly recommend this way of doing it and the Outback Cycling company have good bikes.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A unique and special place to visit in the remote outback of Australia. Be sure to plan very far ahead for hotel and excursions. The Rock will no longer allowed to be climbed after Oct. 26, 2019."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We had a lovely sunrise walk around the base. We did a guided tour which included lots of fantastic information. Magical.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We strolled around the base. There is plenty to see including the geology of the rock, plenty of interpretative material, changing light, it was a really great experience and bigger than I had imagined. It really is a must see."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru itself is fascinating. The red dirt, the wide open spaces, the magnificent rock with its caves, and formations, all absolutely magic!!! HOWEVER it is expensive. Voyages own everything in Uluru outright so they have a monopoly on anything you eat, anything you drink, every tour you take, any one of the 7 accommodation options in the Uluru village... they own there lot. They bus you in, put you on tours, and bus you out all at their cost. As for service... it is great on the tours and it is non existent in the hotels."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a place that must be seen, as an Australian and a visitor. It like you have to see certain places, because they are just an amazing geographical structure, an event in tim, beautiful and makes us a humans realise that this beautiful planet, is far bigger than just our world. It’s 550 Million years old, it’s 250 Million years later that dinosaurs showed up...the beauty of an old continent, country and island like Australia, is not just admired but one is left in awe."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"From my first sight of Uluru until the last sight leaving on Virgin Australia, I was in ore. Such an amazing sight and seen from everywhere as it is huge. I rode around Uluru and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I certainly understand why the local indigenous people hold Uluru so sacred. I chose to respect the wishes of the traditional owners and did not climb. I was amazed at the numerous selfish, self-centred and ignorant reasons some gave for their right to climb. Shame on you all."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We bought the 3 day pass online (much better than buying at gate) and used it every day. One morning did the base walk at sunrise - chilly but a great experience as we took our time over 3 hours stopping at all the little cultural spots. Next day we did the base walk again - during the day when it was warmer and it was still great seeing the rock close up, with all the different colours and shapes. There are a few small sections where you need to observe the signs, respect the wishes of the land owners and not take photos. The cultural centre is also worth a visit. Also did the small men's and women's walks which had good views. One of the highlights was the sunset viewing car park - we got there about 5.30pm and sat outside with drinks and nibbles as we took photos and watched the rock and sky change dramatically as the sun went down. Great atmosphere as most people were also well set up for happy hour. Great views of Uluru from everywhere and a must see."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's a place like no other. We stayed at the Desert Garden Hotel. Only do this if you are willing to pay a bit more for a room with a room with a view of the Rock, otherwise ensure there is a pool for s mid afternoon option. Ensure to pre book all experiences as it gets busy. Day 1- Got in at 3pm Evening...Field of Lights...worth the look 3.5/5 Day 2 Day- Hop on Hop off bus trip to Uluru Remember to purchase the National Parks 3 day pass. Bring at least 2L of water/person if you want to walk around the Rock. I recommend riding a bike if you are able. Evening-Sounds of Silence dinner. About 10 random per people and approx 10 tables. Buffet dinner and not very silent 3.5/5 Day 3 Morning...Camel ride. So much fun 5/5 Evening...Helicopter flight viewing Uluru and Kata Tjuta and then to dinner at Tali Wuri. Forget the rest, if you do one thing this is it. Amazing food, personal table and service. You can get to this dinner by bus too. Sounds of Silence is wanting to be like this 10/10 plus. Day 4 Morning...Kata Tjuta walk through the Valley of the Winds. Amazing, so different to Uluru. 4.5/5 Evening...home"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The only way to fully appreciate Uluru and the red centre is to see it for yourself. We all know it's big, but wow, what an amazing site to see. And for those of you that would like to climb it then you can't go past Dunlop Volleys. Apart from the obvious, water, sunscreen and a hat, the main thing you will need is excellent grip. It's very slippery. Yes I climbed it. It was a massive sence of achievement and pride. I think Uluru is especially inspiring for everyone who makes he effort to visit. Everyone that was there was climbing it. It is dangerous, it's very slippery. It's very steep. So good grip is essential. Making it to the top is so rewarding. It's such a peaceful place where everyone likes to find there own space, sit down and quietly enjoy their time at what feels like the top of the world. Not a worry or concern on the mind. Just an overwhelming feeling of pride, accomplishment and a great respect for the place. And, of course, a magnificent 360 degree view of Australian's red centre. But remember.... Don't forget your Dunlops!!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"uluru has many thing to see and do, you can ride a bike around and you can walk and see little caves and little tracks, it is a great place to be"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"At the end of recent three day trip our tour bus was just starting the four to five hour return journey to Alice Springs but came across a broken down bus from the same company. The tour company's solution was to chuck out tour group of the bus and allow the other tour group with the broke down bus to use our tour bus. Our tour would then wait at the side of the road until 50% of the people could be initially picked up and then a second, as yet to be arranged pick up would sort out the rest. So we were chucked of the bus, by the main road, in the mid day sun with no cover and our bags lying in the dirt. This was a serious safety issue. Left by the side of a busy road with no barriers to stand behind. Standing in the mid day sun and how good does it look for a company to dump passengers at the side of the road. Also makes a joke of their H&S policy - so worried about water consumption but happy to leave passengers in the mid day sun at the side of a road when it's convenient. As a side note the first bus had no sat phone, how safe is driving in the wilderness with no way to contact anyone in an emergency?"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So special to see in in real life. We walked the base, a good, hot walk. Lots to look at, take plenty of water. Great that they have water stations around the rock to fill up water bottles. My husband & daughter climbed it and the views from the top were amazing."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Although many are rushing to climb Uluru before it closes in late October, a lot of people aren't taking the time to walk around the base and read the information about the significance of the rock. There are many options, you can hire a bike and cycle around, go on a segway tour with a guide, book onto a guided walking tour or simply do your own independent walk. It's a great (and easy) walk over flat ground. It takes around 3 hours on average and has sporadic seating along the way. Make sure you fill your water bottle in advance as there are only two or three taps along the way and you don't want to get caught short. Be aware, there are a lot of signs asking you to respect the wishes of the Anangu and not to take pictures of certain areas of significance. These areas are clearly marked so just keep an eye out."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is an aussie icon and it deserves that status. Wow what an amazing place. It is definitely a must see for anyone travelling to central Australia. The rick at sunrise and sunset is particularly special and picturesque. It literally flows. All I can say is what an amazing rock.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You really aren't prepared for the size of this thing until you get there. We did the Mala walk around the base in which the ranger told us the history of the aboriginal people. There was some aboriginal art in a cave and the view at sunset is not to be missed. We did arrive at least an hour before sunset and just scooped up the last space in the lot. Be sure to bring your fly nets and chairs, as you get there early and have to wait. Another couple there had a little picnic which was a nice touch to eat some snacks and watch the sunset. The rock really does flow orange in the setting sunlight - truly spectacular to see the before and after pictures. One note - if you're arriving in Yulara by plane from the south (we came from Melbourne), sit on the left side of the plane for a view of Uluru and Kata Tjuta from the plane, which was also special. Really glad we went to the outback to experience the beauty here."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Very impressive sight. We did not attempt the climb which apparently will soon be banned. Just viewing Uluru was enough and the drive around it was enough for us to appreciate the place.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We saw Uluru both at sunset and sunrise and were not disappointed. The viewing platforms around give great photo opportunities.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The rock was spectacular to see. Ever changing light and mood depending of the time of day, I saw it as the sun rose striking the rock with sunlight. Again in the evening as the sun set, witnessing the darkening colours from deep red to almost purple. Back lit with a sky that was a light blue on the horizon to a pinkish hue higher in the sky."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Family of 5, children 8,9,11 experienced Uluru and the sites. We absolutely loved the experience, but if we were to go again, having our own car is a must and you wouldn't do any tours as you can do it all yourself! You fly in over the rock and olgas, its approx 8 min to the small township from the airport with stunning views both directions of the Katu Juita National Park. We stayed at Sails in the desert which were comfortable motel style rooms and included a buffet breakfast with a large variety and chef on hand to cook eggs etc. this is the best way to start your day and fuel up, as there is only one IGA in town which we found had a great supply but stocks were low. We purchased snacks and premade sandwiches and salads from the IGA for lunches. There is a bus to the rock daily, but we found times were limited and it was an extra cost of $50 return each trip. A national park pass is required to be pre purchased online, this is mandatory and needs to be shown everytime you enter the national park, this was aprox $65 for a family pass. We experienced sunrises and sunsets in this stunning place, definetely check the weather prior to your trip as it was 0 deg at 6.30am and then 30 deg by lunch time. Our first day was wasted as we landed at 10am and with no car couldn't get out to the rock unless we returned at 7pm due to bus times, after a 5am plane flight we weren't prepared to risk this late return. Camel tour sunrise was an experience, kids absolutely loved it, but I found it was all about them taking professional photos for us to purchase and it was absolutely freezing. We managed to be back to motel for breakfast before we headed out to the rock for the bike ride. The bike ride around the rock was our highlight, we hired bikes from the cultural centre and took off, we rode about 16km it was amazing to see it from all around, there is a water station halfway. We all climbed to the first section of the rock, it was steep and slightly harder to breath, but amazing. On return the kids took a dip in the pool, water temp was about 12deg so they didn't last long. Buffet Dinner at the hotel was great, also with a chef to prepare steaks, fish, lamb and roast how you order it. Sunrises close to 7am so quiet civilised time, so next morning we went and watched the rock come alive at a viewing point and short walk across the road from the resort. My Husband and 11 then climbed the rock, it was 45min up and about 30 down, do to the bus timetable and not wanting to be stuck there all day, they did rush, the feedback was it was very steep and dangerous, there was a section where my husband had to pull the 11 year old up whilst lying on his tummy. But the experience was amazing and they were so excited to have done it. Myself and the other two did Aboriginal Dot Art, it was about making your own story using the Aboriginal Symbols and then showing it to the group, this was an enjoyable experience. We then headed out to the Kata Juita (Olgas) which is approx 40min drive, we took the short walk into the Gorge (Silence of the Winds), there is another walk that is slightly longer, though alot of the land around is sacred and you are not allowed to go all the way around. Sunset was at a viewing area inside the national park looking at the rock, its very pretty, this is not an exclusive area and you could drive out with your wine and cheese :-). The outback BBQ dinner was next to the cultural centre beside the rock, this was just an average bbq, the highlite was the night sky and once all the lights were out, the milky way, the stars and the entire sky came to life, with a short astronomy lesson to end the evening. We loved our time out at Uluru and we would love to go back. Though as I suggested earlier if you have your own Car, you wouldn't really need to do any tours, as there is nothing exclusive about them, don't expect much of the food, Sails had by far the best food options, they are marketing everything to the tourist, but Central Australia is a long way by car, so if you can look past this and be prepared to be covered in red dirt you will have a great time!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Everyone needs to make the time to go check out Uluru. It is the most beautiful place, enormous, vibrant and amazing. You don’t need to walk on the rock to appreciate the beauty of it and the sense of peace it gives you. Make sure you go."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,“The Rock” truly has to be seen to appreciate its awesomeness. Such an iconic place and symbol of The Territory and Australia’s unique landscape. We started to walk around the base never thinking we could manage the complete circuit ...... but we DID IT in just over two hours. Great to see different views of The Rock itself and the flora on the ground. Weather warm but not too hot at this time. Perhaps July or August might be even more comfortable for walking. A ‘bucket list’ must for all Aussies but no climbing!!!!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We have been traveling in camper van from Darwin and to reach Uluru you need to drive almost 2000km in desert. Once you see Uluru, the massive rock, it's an indescribable feeling. Uluru is the Australian Jewel. We have been traveling also in Queensland and there is nothing nicer or more beautiful then the Ayers Rock. Maybe the White Sundays are on the same level. It's a pity to hear that a lot of people prefer to go overseas or elsewhere instead of coming here because it's very expensive. I reckon every Australian resident must see this place and be proud of it. 10 stars"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Fantastic piece of Australia with a deep history and a culture worth immersing yourself in. Highly recommend to put this destination on your to do list. Everything you need is within the local area.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We cycled around this amazing Rock and were amazed at its size, colours and forms. It is just as beautiful from afar as it is close up. We drove around to get another perspective, and watched the sunset on it. Definitely a must do experience in Australia."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is truly amazing! Great to spend time there in different ways - we have cycled around, done a short walk, watched a sunrise and a sunset with dinner. Amazing."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"On a freezing but sparklingly clear morning, Adam led a small group of us on an utterly enthralling and highly informed commentary around the base of Uluru - about 12 km all up. It was a long and cold trek but worth every inconvenience to be this close to such an ancient monolith, narrated with such fascinating Indigenous history. Don't miss this - and THANKS to Adam for such an extraordinary experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Brilliant, changing colours, throughout the day and night. There are many vantage points depending on the time of day. The sunset viewing was spectacular! Make sure to get up close, whichever way you prefer, foot, bicycle, segway, camel, helicopter... it's powerful, vast and memorable."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My 2nd visit to Uluru, it is such a breathtaking Rock, the different colours it projects during the day is incredible, everyone needs to see Uluru, sunrise, sunset and during the day"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Each time we drove out during our 3 day stay, we still got the same feeling as when we saw it for the first time. Magical, inspiring, awesome, in actual fact no words can describe it and it should be on everyone’s bucket list to see. Several spots to see sunrise and sunset, several small walks around to see the dry waterfall and cave paintings. Took me 3 hrs to walk around base and view everything there is to see. Several sections had 2 inches of bull dust, make sure you have good shoes, but it’s all flat. Don’t forget to buy online your $25, 3 day park pass before you come, that way you don’t have to line up at the gate. Food is expensive in the same supermarket, however they do have $5.50 fresh sandwiches and $11 bbq chickens. Buy your staples in the morning as they ran out of bread one day we were there"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My wife and I spent 5 days at Uluru and we found it a most magical place to visit. We walked around the rock we visited multiple places and found that there was so much to do . This is Anangu land, and as such respect this place when you visit, respect the traditional owners, listen to the elders, speak to the locals."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We have travelled from Victoria and every kilometre was well and truly worth it. I can not describe the sense of awe you experience when you first lay eyes on Uluru some 40 km away. You could spend an entire day watching Uluru change colour as the hours go by. It is beautiful in the morning, during the day and spectacular in the evening ( try to make time for a sunset visit). We purchased a $50 3 day pass as we are going to see Kata Tjuta tomorrow. We bought our own bikes an rode the 10 km base track- a great way to see Uluru. Bikes can be hired for a fee. We didn’t climb Uluru out of respect and it certainly didn’t detract from a wonderful experience. Climbing Uluru isn’t what this part of Australia is about - learning about the traditional owners culture and respect is what have left with."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This geological feature and the aboriginal stories about it are true wonders of our world. Takes lots of time in the Cultural Center and it’s adjoining buildings. Then take more time to explore the rock and its features. Try to get an aboriginal guide. Do not climb it and respect the cultural history by not photographing in the restricted areas.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"the base walk around the rock is 10km or approximately 3 hours. The weather is normally hot even during winter time. The base walk along the track is very far away from the rock, its almost hard to see the details. But the biggest stitch up is that there aren't any toilets along the midway. What does Parks Australia expect walkers to do???? Hold it in? If the rock is a culture sensitive area, then build a toilet along the way, at least no one will be relieving themselves next to the rock. What about the children? Think about the visitor's well being and respect the place. The entrance is 25 bucks per person every day of the every year. Surely, Parks Australia can afford a septic system on the way and perhaps a drink station. Just a suggestion."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have long wanted to visit Uluru and my recent trip there was literally the best holiday of my life. I just couldn't get enough of this beautiful icon and the many and wonderful ways there are to experience it. Sunrise and sunsets here are breathtaking. I felt no compulsion to climb it and, in fact, banned or not - I never would. There are so many other ways to enjoy it. In my opinion, every Australian should visit Uluru and Kata Tjuta. We will be back, for sure."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My hubby and I just did the base walk and it was Amazing , we loved it . Our guide Adam was fantastic and very knowledgeable. Would def recommend this tour . It took around 3 hours at a good pace we stopped many times to admire and learned a lot. We stopped for breaky an hour in which was just what we needed .And watched the sunrise as we walked around the rock and watched the colour change . Loved it"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Stunning experience to see Uluru and the base walk is really recommendable. We went here, when it was around 30 degress celsius and it was fine to do the walk here. Beautiful formations and a special aura around the place. One thing to be aware of is that this place is infested with flies (like most of central Australia). There are literally billions of them and it is extremely annoying. Consider buying a fly net if you dont like them."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The Uluru National Park is a credit to the people who run it. It is pristine. Absolutely beautiful. Magical. Many activities to fill your day.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After dreaming of visiting Uluru and Kata Tjuta for a long long time I finally visited this week. We could only get 2 nights there but boy did we squeeze as much as we could in. 2 sunsets and a sunrise , the walk around the base , the Mala tour , Sounds of SIlence , Field of Lights , Camping. So here is what I have to say for futures visitors of the area.Hire a Car, it is absolutely the best way to get around and it means that you are not restricted to bus schedules.There's an IGA near the hotel area. The best breakfast however was at the Cultural centre !! $12.50 for a massive breakfast of eggs , toast , baked beans , bacon and tomato, there's a coffee van at the base of the rock, and the coffee was $5 . Food such as hot chips etc can also be found at the petrol station.Do yourself a favour and do not leave the area without visiting the cultural centre it is just wonderful with lots of art , a beautiful free movie on the history of the hand back , books to read , classes on dot painting and bush tucker. Get yourself a face net if you can before you get there as they can range from $10 - $20 once you are in the area,the flies can really just start to get to you after a while. There is limited phone reception at the rock. I hope I have shed some light on the area just a little for any future visitors. Enjoy the magic that is Uluru"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It’s a place there is so much you can do. I booked myself into 4 days and 3 nights but realized that it was too short. Sunset watching Field of Lights, sunrise, Uluru, Kata Kjuta and Kings Canyons, they all provide different grand views of beautiful nature."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It has been on my bucket list to see Uluru and I am so happy that we did it. It is a fascinating sandstone almost as if it is magical with its colour change during the day and all its history. I would go so far to say that a trip to Australia is not complete without seeing Uluru 😀
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We were treated to such an enjoyable look around “the big rock” by our guide Nick who really made it such a pleasant experience. After a little training at the beginning for the newbies, everyone was off. The scenery was spectacular, education on the traditional stories as well as native flora and fauna made it well worth the couple of hours out of our day. The smiles at the end from all our group said it all. Highly recommend this activity and our guide Nick."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wide skies are the backdrop to this awe-inspiring wonder of the natural world. Spend time with a great guide and walk around the base of Uluru, and then take the paths into Kata Tjuta. Makes a person seem very small and insignificant."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visit at sunrise or sunset for the spectacular sight transforming from ocher to orange and intense red. One of the great natural wonders of the world, Uluru or Ayers Rock is not only a natural formation, but it's a deeply spiritual place. You can feel a powerful presence the moment you set your eyes on it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This a wonderful place to checkout in Australia and absolutely worth going to the middle of the country to experience it. You’ll need to rent a vehicle to get around on your own, something I definitely recommend. You need to spend at least two days to get the most out of your stay. I’d recommend seeing sunrise and sunset at each location, Kata Tjuta and Uluru, on each day. There are plenty of hiking opportunities at each location and I recommend completing the Valley of the Winds trail but keep in mind this is considered a difficult hike and you need to e sure you have plenty of water, are wearing a bush hat, and have high spf sunscreen for your body and for your lips because there is a hole in the ozone right smack on Australia. Also, at night, make sure to go outside and look up, you’ll have the amazing gift to see the Milky Way arch across the sky, an understandable reason why this land is posited with spiritual value. A last note, do not climb Uluru, although there are no laws impeding you from climbing it, just keep in mind that this is sacred land to the First Nations people of Australia so DO NOT CLIMB ULURU to afford these people respect. To give context, visitors do not climb the walls of the Vatican nor the walls of Mecca so this shouldn’t be any different."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We got the climb in before the closure, well worth the effort to get up there. The walk around the base takes an unwed detour around sacred sites, could have been made shorter and till kept the privacy up."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,There is so much to see and do around the rock without disrespecting the owners and climbing all over it. It's an overwhelming experience.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Did the base walk to respect traditional owners. Was pretty but had many flies and was quite sunny and hot. Would recommend avoiding 11am-3pm as it is very hot. Iconic rock is a must visit in the red centre but would recommend going to Kings Canyon and MacDonald Ranges is pressed for time.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I would highly recommend this sunrise base walk around Uluru. The scenery and formations were absolutely stunning. The immense size of the rock was surprising along with the richness of fauna surrounding it. It felt very special to experience close up, the history and sacredness of this site. Our guide Tia was warm, wise and incredibly knowledgeable about the area and expressed great reverence and respect for it's cultural significance to it's ancient inhabitants and for the peoples themselves. Tia made this once in a lifetime experience just that much more unique and special. Thank you very much!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So yes, as my title suggests, you won’t Be able to climb Uluru after 26th October 2019, which is very disappointing as the climb was a highlight for us and one of the most iconic walks you can do in Australia. I’m glad I did it and if I could have only done the base walk, my review score would have been nearer 3 stars."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is one of those places I think we all leave for “some day”. It’s not cheap to visit and by the time you add up all the costs, it’s often just as much to go abroad to Asia and really stretch those hard-won annual leave days to the max. But this year, we needed a mini-break and decided that this was the year to visit this heart of Australia, this icon, this source of so much debate. And Uluru delivers in spades. From the moment you catch your first glimpse (and if you’re lucky, you’re on the correct side of the plane if flying into Yulara), it will take your breath away. I was - quite frankly - speechless. On the ground, Uluru sits like a beacon in the distance and looms large as you approach. The colour is stunning and changes with the passing of the sun. The surface is not smooth but full of character with crevices and caves. The play of light and shadow is quite mesmerising. This magnificent rock sits proudly, with nothing else around for miles and the horizon stretching away as far as you can see. I was in awe and suddenly realised why Uluru was the source of such passion. Which is why, when we finally found ourselves passing through the Mala car park on our hired bikes, the sight of hundreds of people tramping up the side of Uluru, the thousands of foot treads creating that white stain from the ground all the way to the top and the chain fence unforgivingly anchored into the rock was like a shock to the system. We knew all about the debate (to climb or not to climb) well before our arrival into Yulara. We hadn’t made up our mind until that very moment. It was right then that I understood why this place was so special - not only for the indigenous people but for all of us - and deserves to be preserved. We chose not to climb. It’s a personal decision for everyone and I am certainly not one to judge. But I’m content that we saw this beautiful rock, in her many guises and from many angles, in a respectful way and it made me feel good about my choice. If you’re reading this review, maybe your “some day” is not so far away ..."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Hire a bike, ride around the rock, plenty to look at, different shades ov colour, if you can climb it do it, its one of those must do."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well worth travelling the distance for the magnificent scenery and learning about the culture with it. Certainly large amounts of people to contend with which is a shame for a remote “quiet “ outback place. All the park rules seem a bit over the top but can see it is necessary for management of the volumes of tourists from all over the world. The park was noticeably clean....free of rubbish.....which was great to see. Can see a lot of good management, work and money has gone into preserving this magnificent piece of Australia"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is incredible in it's contrast with the flat desert around it. The park is operated very efficently with lots of viewing area parking.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A Beautiful Site of Uluru, Ayers Rock in The New Territory of the Out Back in Northern Australia! A must See for Aboriginal History & Culture!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We rode around the rock. So good. Highly recommend this way to see the rock. We hardly peddled at all. It wasnt hard. If your thinking you cant do it and walking would be easier your wrong. Jump on the bike and ride. It was great.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What an amazing place! We respected the aboriginals request and rode around the rock and walked through the cultural centre. The experience is understanding what the majesty of Uluru meant to them and not walking over their sacred place. The view around the rock close up is truly mind blowing. I will be back to ride around or walk it again. Sunset viewing is awesome
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"With great respect to the indigenous owners and as fellow Australians, my husband and I climbed the rock as planned! It was a bucket list item and we do not regret it! Such a majestic feat! The climb was closed first thing so we did the base walk which we enjoyed. Then late morning they opened the gates and a steady stream of people started the ascent! Wear good hiking shoes as it is a slippery climb. Well... I keep myself somewhat fit but I’ll admit it was very very tough. Like really hard. I was actually surprised how difficult and treacherous the climb was!? The guide joked about the “80’s safety protocol!” Anyway we made it the top! It took us all up round trip about 2h 15mins (with 1h 30m of that to get up)! Just stop and stare and breathe it all in. In the heart of this great land! Spectacular views. Almost lunar Mars like landscape up there. Couldn’t believe the sheer size of the rock! If you can, get there before October 2019 when they close the climb and stop sharing this wonderful piece of Australia! Such a shame."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After putting off a trip to Uluru for many years. Finally went and absolutely loved it. The whole experience was fantastic, I would highly recommend a trip to this area. We didn’t climb Uluru due to respect of the indigenous people but rode around it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow!! Impressive. Photos don’t do justice. The contrast between the red, blue and green is incredible and even better than imagined. The walks around and to the summit are beautiful. This was an amazing experience. We hired a car to get around and weren’t involved in any tours directly relating to Uluru. Everyone we came across during our 4 day stay in Yulara and visiting Uluru, Kata Tjuta and Kings Canyon were lovely. I dare say because we did not do any tours directly at Uluru we were able to enjoy our experience visiting and climbing without judgement from anyone we met in the vicinity (both local and or on contract). We didn’t directly ask opinions, just interacted as we would with anyone. We understand that people have different ideas about whether you should climb to the summit, we found that people not at all related to the area had the most to say both before and after our visit. We will never forget climbing to the summit. The views from the top were awesome, the whole experience was A…M…A…Z…I…N…G and unforgettable! If you plan to visit and attempt the summit before closure in October I would suggest it is more likely to open in the afternoon than the morning. Ensure you have good shoes, water and a snack, therefore no need to rush the experience. I would avoid on a hot, windy or wet day as I can imagine it would be quite unsafe (and likely wisely not open anyway). A level of fitness is ideal and common sense to stay safe wouldn’t go astray. It took us 3 hours up and down with 30 minutes at the summit to take in the splendour. We didn’t rush. Again… wow!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"All it's cracked up to be. Do the free Mala Walk in the morning and then the base walk (about 12km total, but flat). Up to you whether you climb it before October 2019 but would you swim in the Trevi Fountain, pose for a selfie in the lap of the Lincoln Memorial? Give it the respect it deserves as there's so much to enjoy about it without climbing it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Actually seeing and touching Uluru is completely different to what you see in photos. It changes colour, depending on how the sun shines on it's surface. At times it looks like a big clump of dirt, a brown rock or a spectacular bright orange mass. We did the bass walk and thoroughly enjoyed the stories and history of the rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,My mum and I spent 4 nights at Yulara exploring Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park and it was an amazing experience!! I would highly recommend to anyone who is thinking about visiting :)
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I am a tour guide who is also a retired paramedic. I’m often in National Parks) An AED (Automatic External Defibrillator) if needed in a medical emergency, needs to be IMMEDIATELY available. Please see my photos below, which illustrate the access of two AEDs. One is at Watarrka NP (Kings Canyon) and the other is at Uluru - Kata Tjuta NP (Ayers Rock). 1. Watarrka NP have done the right thing. Their AED is right below the Emergency Radio that is used to call for assistance. 1. Uluru - Kata Tjuta NP have placed their AED inexplicably over 1km from their Emergency Radio, in a chemical store next to toilets. And what’s worse is the fact that the door is padlocked. I only found out when cleaners allowed me to look for the AED. I added a second photo showing that indeed the grubby box has an AED in it! Before making this review, I had several times explained why this is I appropriate to Parks Rangers. Their response ranged from “What’s an AED?” to “Its their because it may get vandalized”. In January last year I found another AED in the Cultural Centre of the same park behind a locked door. It only got moved after I made a similar review here on Trip Advisor. See my earlier review! You make up your own mind as to the preparedness of the Rangers should a visitor suffer a Cardiac Arrest. 1 Star is one more than they deserve on this issue."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Went with ATT Travel, probably a 15 minute drive from hotel, we had drinks and snacks all laid out for our coach party and got to watch the sun setting over Uluru, which is so much bigger when seen in real life. We then drove closer to a bbq area where we had a very good array of steak, chicken, prawns and kangaroo Salads puddings and drink The guide was very knowledgeable and also turned all lights off and gave us a talk on the star formations above us. Would highly recommend this trip"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes it's expensive but because of that I decided we were going to see and do as much as possible in the 4 days we spent there. Prebook everything and you won't be disappointed. Definitely hire a car through Voyages (cheaper, unlimited kms), and you have the freedom to go anywhere and do anything whenever you like (except for Sounds of Silence and Field of lights). I recommended driving out to Talinguru Nyakunytjaku for sunrise overlooking the rock (45 min drive from Yulara) then driving to the Rock to walk the base or do a guided tour if you want to learn more. If you go before October 2019 and you're adventurous, I know it's frowned upon but climbing the Rock was an amazing once in a lifetime experience and I'm glad I did it before it closes permanently, but it's definitely scary! By lunchtime you'll have seen enough and can drive to the Olgas, maybe another 45 min drive and you can do a couple of walks there too. We were back at the hotel in time for a brief rest before catching our tour bus to the Field of Lights. We spent another day driving out to Kings Canyon, walking the rim and driving back. In hindsight, we should have arranged to stay the night at Kings Canyon so we could see the sunset there and not have to drive the 3.5hrs back to Yulara the same day; 7 hrs driving in one day is a lot! As I stated in my title, it's not a cheap holiday by any means but certainly a once in a lifetime experience that I glad I did, so save up and expect to be spending some serious dollars! Kings Canyon is a definite highlight!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Okay, first of all, the very important stuff: Kata Tjuta (The Olgas) and Uluru (Ayers Rock) are in the same vicinity, (about 58km apart by road) but both are around 6 hours' drive from Alice Springs (around 500 kilometres). That's six hours' drive out and six hours' drive back; and you need to take breaks along the way. This is something many people don't know and it's not readily advertised. It's just not the next suburb over from Alice Springs, it's a very, very long drive and if you stay for the sunset spectacular at Uluru you won't get back to Alice Springs until around midnight; driving the road at night is dangerous due to wandering cattle and wildlife. Thankfully there is fly-in fly-out and accommodation options for Uluru now. The next most important piece of information is to take or buy a fly net to put over your hat. Even if you go in the Australian winter there are flies; not as many as in summer, but they are still very annoying and will try to get into your mouth, ears, eyes and nose to get protein. Yuk! Now for The Rock. You can walk around it; if you have a guide you can hear Aboriginal stories of how various caverns and caves in the rock were used; what certain formations mean or you can just sit and admire the beauty of the rock at sunset. From October 2019 the rock will be closed to people walking on it. Until then you can climb up one side of the rock, there is a huge chain to help you part of the way, but it isn't recommended and it is considered disrespectful by the traditional owners. It's somewhere every Australian should visit at least once to gain an understanding of the vastness and beauty of our country. It is in the middle of a desert though and I would recommend visiting in the Australian winter months as temperatures in summer can reach 40+ degrees; that's 40+ celsius folks or 104F. Dehydration can be a killer."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I can't believe I made it here. Words really can't describe it. So many good views. We spent 3.5 hours walking around the base of Uluru which was a highlight (including stopping for a picnic lunch we brought with us). Enjoyed seeing it at sunrise and sunset. Do yourself a favor and skip the tours and rent a car and do it at your own pace. All the roads are sealed, it's easy to get around, and you can't get lost!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We climbed Uluru in the late 1980s - this time we were able to apologise to the local people for our lack of understanding. We walked around the base this time, which is highly recommended to really comprehend how huge this monolith truly is. Just a note - we had read many recommendation for flynets, but chose to ignore them for two reasons - we had been to Uluru before with no need for nets, and secondly, we are used to flies (being national tourists). WE WERE WRONG. The bush flies were incessant and extremely irritating. The current thought is that they will disappear after a decent frost but if in doubt, I would carry a net. For your sanity :)"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Awesome visit. Exceeded all expectations. The rock is magnificent and found the resort very good. The Olga’s were a great experience also and and well worth the visit. Other all a great trip.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,My daughter and I stayed at the Outback Pioneer Hotel Motel for 7 days whilst on tour of Uluru and the Anangu peoples.beautiful mystical countrryside. The Hotel was a pleasure to come home to. Hot showers clean and comforttable rooms and peaceful ambiience.complete with covered outside bar fantastic takeway and finedining restaurant I recommend the cxoolest time of the year to avoid the little black flies as we did.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Words do not do this awesome experience justice. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity & I will be back to see the Olgas next time! Bucket list ticked!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There is something powerful and humbling when setting your eyes on Uluru up close. The history, the cultural significance, the majestic beauty, it all pours out of this amazing icon of Australia. I had been told by a few people that Kata Tjuta rated as their favourite spot, but to me, it paled in to comparison to Uluru. Make sure you walk around it and take it all in. Worth the investment of your time, you will not regret it. Oh, and please don't climb the rock, respect it and those for who it means so so much more than just a great view from the top....."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Absolutely amazing! You can't imagine how amazing Uluru is until you see it in person. The red soil and desert landscape is beautiful. Definitely worth a visit, it's about 40min from the resort so you can drive but remember to pre-book your car. We used the hop on hop off bus which is good but expensive."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The sunset tour was perfect to see Uluru as the sun was setting and the amazing transformation. Our guides Dylan and Joe were great, very informative and professional. They were great with our kids and and made the tour educational and fun. Very worthwhile tour!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This geological form rises out from the ground, and has such a special place in all Australian hearts. It’s on many bucket lists. You will need to buy a Pass to enter the National Park. $25 per person. Not pets are allowed in National parks in Australia.. There are no cafes there, so take all your food and waiter. There can be many flies"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is a wonderful sight and the various walks and viewing platforms make for wonderful pictures. As of 26 October 19 the walk into the rock will be closed. Kings Canyon some 400km is a must plus a visit to the stations on the way there is worth while. Also on the other side of the Rock is what was known as the Olga’s which is also worth a visit. Just be aware the accommodation and food is really expensive so budget accordingly
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's a good hike that goes through the valleys within the large rock formations. More interesting than just walking around the edge of the formation. Interesting, good views, somewhat strenuous but not too bad. We did the hop on tour bus (cheapest option) to see the parks. They still did the sunrise stop which I think is overrated. Too many people all taking a picture at the same time at a small stop."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We went to the subset viewing platform were there earlier than sunset and put my iPhone on time lapse and was really pleased with the outcome
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Spent 3 nights at the resort. We walked the base and climbed the rock. Also did the Valley of the wind walk all were great. The resort is super overpriced for everything so bring your own Tim-Tams.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Spent 6 days at the end of May 2019 enjoying all the main attractions, and YES I did climb the rock as this was my main purpose in going. Housekeeping staff at the Outback Pioneer were wonderful - really nice to come back to a refreshed room after a long day walking and climbing. Food service can be a little slow and maybe a caravan could be added to help with extending the options. The Prepaid breakfast at $25 instead of $37 filled me for the day so well worth it. Recommend the Field of Lights Star Pass and AAT Kings trip to Kings Canyon. Disappointing that many jobs on the tours are taken by overseas workers, even though they are enthusiastic. Would have thought this was a prime job for the locals and would give more time for tourists to interact and get a first hand appreciation of the culture and needs of the community."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our family of 5 decided to just do an overnight to Uluru to finally see the ROCK! Even though we only had 24 hours in Uluru, we certainly saw plenty. Our first impression of the rock was how huge it was and the colours were absolutely beautiful. The sunset showed so many colours on the rock and behind and we had the bonus of a full moon behind it in our photos - stunning! Two in our group decided to climb and said the descent was worst than the ascent. They did the return trip to the plaque on top in around 90 minutes. Wear good shoes, as they said it can be very slippery on the way down. Take fly nets as the flies are dreadful but to be expected. We walked around whilst the others were climbing and the paths were good. The sheer size was just incredible to see and we were all glad to tick it off our bucket list especially before the climb permanently closes on 26 October. It is around a 20 minute drive from Ayers Rock Resort. We felt it was definitely worth seeing even though we were only there for 24 hours."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Photos cannot do Uluru and the surrounding area justice. It is so beautiful from dawn till dusk. I opted to do a Segway tour around Uluru which was brilliant as to talk all the way round takes around 3 hours. Would definitely recommend that future travellers respect the local people and do not climb Uluru.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our first visit to Uluru & “it” didn’t disappoint. We walked, & drove, around the base & viewed it at sunrise & sunset from various vantage points - it always looked magnificent. The only disappointment was the people who continue to climb it - even after reading the information at the base of the climb asking you to respect Uluru as a Sacred Site of the Anangu people, the traditional owners. Can’t wait for October 31 to arrive & all will be banned from climbing."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru was breathtaking. We chose to do sunset, sunrise and bike around the base. It was bug season so biking around was the way to go. Photos of the rock do not do it justice. It’s massive. Stop into the gallery and view (and buy) art to support the indigenous people."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Fantastic to visit and loved it. Climbing is still available until October 2019 but fiercely discouraged by people working there as well as the many signs. It is very steep, slippery and not for the faint hearted. At a least if you intend to climb the rock have the right shoes that will grip. It is closed when it is windy and that is very appropriate. Many options to get around the rock from Segway, walking and push bikes. Very clean and well looked after."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We walked around the base of Uluru Rock and respected the cultural request not to climb. It was well sign posted with information boards. We also walked The Valley of the Winds which was spectacular but hot and one needs to have a supply of water. It is longer than you think with some steep climbs or descents depending which way one walks it.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Hire a car, get on a Segway tour, hit the sounds of silence with field of light add on and have the trio of a life tied to the rock :)"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I wasn't disappointed in my visit to Uluru. The scenery is amazing. The colours so strong. You can feel how spiritual the place is. Heaps to see and do. Hiking is awesome. Cool mornings and nights.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you have 3 spare days go to the red centre. Such a special place with the most amazing scenery. The history is amazing, the sights and walks incredible. Be ready to be amazed, go to view at sunrise and sunset. Drink plenty of water. Relax and enjoy First thing we did was laugh at people wearing fly masks over their heads, the second thing we did was buy them."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had a excellent visit to The Rock, the walk around is a couple of hours and worth the walk. Unfortunately the climb was closed both times we visited due high winds about this time of year, it’s a bit of a hit and miss with the openings, the Ranger reviews the wind speed at ground level at various times throughout the day to determine if they open it. The cultural centre and hotels get emails during the day about the status of the climb, so that will save a trip out to The Rock if you only want to climb."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I spent 3 1/2 days at uluru and saw most of the sights. My favourite was the uluru climb (accentuated by the fact it is a level 5/5 climb and the hard effort). Thought i share some tips with people. 1. If you are going to see the sunrise, pre-purchase the national park pass. You will get into the park quicker 2. Also, when seeing the sunrise, go as early as possible. I would recommend that you be at the gates when they open (and before), particularly if you are going to the kata tjuta sunrise place, during peak periods and when it's great sunrise weather. In early may, the gates open at 6am and the sunrise is 7:10am. The drive and walk to the kata tjuta sunrise viewpoint is at least 35 minutes (it was busy, but not a peak time when i went). The tour buses get to the gates around opening time, car queues do form and i'm sure you want to beat them to the best parts of the viewing spots. If you go to the right part of the kata tjuta sunrise spot, you can see a pretty distant uluru sunrise. If you only have time to see 1 sunrise, i would go to the kata tjuta sunrise spot. 3. The opening and closing of the uluru climb is assessed 5 times a day. 7am, 8am, 10am, 12pm and 2pm. If it is closed at 7am, it DOES NOT mean it's closed for the whole day. On the day I climbed (8/5), it was closed at 7am and 8am. It was opened at 10am. So, if you know the weather and wind forecast will improve, be patient. Similarly, the climb can be closed at any time (eg: when the wind picks up). We saw that on 9/5. The climb was open already at 10am, but by the time we walked around uluru, it was closed (2pm). Allow more than 3 hours to do the climb. The climb does not become flat after you finish climbing the chain section. The climb can get to a hands and knees scrambling or a sliding experience. 4. Best to wear shoes with non-slip soles to climb uluru. If you have hiking shoes, better still, but should have some toe flexibility. If you get hand blisters easy, gloves for the chain section is good. 6. The valley of the winds walk is rocky, unlike the uluru base walk. 7. If you are pressed for time, consider hiring a bicycle near the cultural centre and cycle around the uluru. 8. The free ranger guided walk is worth doing. I think that they try to finish by 12pm. 9. If you are lucky and happen to be at uluru at the right time and want to experience aboriginal culture, look for the notices around uluru (particularly at the cultural centre) for the open day of the aboriginal town near uluru. It is rarely open to the public. 10. In early may, there is no sun on uluru at sunrise when viewed from the official sunrise spot. The kata tjuta sunrise and the two sunset spots are great. The uluru car sunset spot is closer and better than the coach/bus sunset spot. I would recommend seeing the cultural centre. I enjoyed it. Early May has a lot of flies, so bring a flynet. Uluru is surrounded by flat plains, so it is windy. For cooler days, wear warmer clothes to counter any wind chill (particularly on cool windy days below 25 degrees or if you feel the cold). Finally, I heard whispers that once the uluru climb is closed in late october 2019, the climbing infrastructure will be pulled out. I would come back again, even if the climb is closed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Immerse yourself in the stars: twinkles above in the sky and on the ground; the breeze touches your hairs and whispers at your ears. Then the first light of the dawn lights up the sky, the golden light brightens the Ayers Rock and the new day comes. Fabulous? Definitely! This is once in a lifetime time experience and maybe already on your bucket list, at least it's on mine. At the centre of Australia, I crossed out 2 items on my list, watching the milky way and sunrise at the Uluru. It's awesome. The Field of Light exhibition is wonderful. Over 50000 slender stems with lightbulbs and 300,000 components are used for this art and in the centre of the desert! The exhibition has been extended and will be finished till end of 2020. Apart from bringing your camera, don't forget to bring your jacket and loved one. I am sure you will enjoy the romantic moments."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This iconic natural feature is a magnificent rock with many stories to tell. It is a spiritual place with many creation stories associated with it - the natural beauty is self evident. Walk, bus tour, camel ride, segue or from the air. A photographic dream."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There is so much to see, experience and enjoy you'll want at least two days. Hire a knowledgeable guide if you haven't already engaged one. Yes you can enjoy the experience without one but you will get so much more out of it with a good guide. Plan a sunset and a sunrise visit as well as plenty of time to explore the many ancient aspects. This is one of those places in the world a person really should see and experience if in the country at all. It is truly spectacular and inspiring."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It’s a long drive to Uluru and back from the Stuart highway. The sunrise viewing area has wifi which was a surprise to see in outback. Not what we had come for. A drive around Uluru is possible. It was enjoyable viewing it from different angles. It is a beautiful place. It’s lonleiness is amazing. The view of The Olgas in the distance is also great.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a great way to celebrate my birthday ! What a highlight to visit this special place - helicopter ride, cultural centre visit and a walk thru the Olga’s"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,don't bother and take a flynet please at total waste of time just a big stone sticking up in the desert
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Absolutey loved seeing it in person. This 600 million + rock was magnificent to actually look at in real life. Attempted to climb it but got 1/4 of the way up the chain and decided it was too dangerous and slippery for me so gingergly and slowly walked/crawled on backside back. We decided to hire a bike the following day and rode around the base of it which was good enough for us. If u get the chance to see it you wont be disappointed.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Australian’s and visitors to Australia should not miss the opportunity to experience the majesty of this natural wonder. I recommend taking a walk at the base. If the 10 to 12 kilometres around the rock is too far, I suggest you start at the car park where people climb the rock. Take two seperate walks to both the left and the right of this carpark. There are many plaques explaining the different aboriginal artworks, and sheltering caves. The waterholes were particularly special and a great place to sit in the quiet in awe of the natural beauty. If you have time the sunset is spectacular, the sunrise not so much."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Loved it, can’t wait to go again. Highly recommended, and well worth the price. Uluru is truly a magic place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We arrived very early to catch the sunrise over Uluru, we were pretty well dressed we thought, but boy it was still pretty cold and took some time for us to thaw out. The way the rock changes colour as the sun light hits it is really amazing, if you looked away for a second it was a different shade when you looked back. A great way to start your day."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A must see. Offers great insight into indigenous culture and a greater appreciation of their sacred places.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow! If Uluru is not on your bucket list it should be! It is truelly an ancient magical place steeped in culture and dreamtime! Great hiking, pristine air and great people! Had dinner at unset near the rock overlooking the “ field of light installation”. Climbing the massive rock closes permanently in Oct ( good news)."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"we visited in may and the weather was excellent, it was really cold at night, but during the day a lovely 24 degrees. on our visit we did the base walk around the rock, but didnt get to climb it as it was shut due to being windy. the walk was really easy, 10 klm and flat took me 1and half hours and i dont walk very fast. in sections you got right up to the rock"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,My sister and myself did a Sunrise tour of Kata Tjuta Domes in the National park with Seit Outback Australia Our tour guide Mas was very knowledgeable and we learnt about the culture of the people their beliefs and the history of the land and structures she was very passionate and professional and had a great personality. The picnic breakfast was not what we expected and could have been better but we had a great time with lovely people. It was an amazing experience and would recommend doing it
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had two different tours (Sunrise & Sunset) at Ayers Rock and Kata Tjuta National Park arranged through Sight-Seeing Tours Australia. We saw the changing colours of Ayers rock during Sunrise as well as Sunset. We also travelled along the periphery of Ayers Rock and covered a walk through Walpa Gorge, Mutijulu water hole and aboriginal rock paintings. Both the trips were very good and were of a great experience!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru was not really on my bucket list. The cheap airfares were the main reason I invited a small group to go and have a look. Truly one of the most amazing experiences I have encountered in my travels. I decided I wanted to run the 10km around Uluru stopping st points for photos (be aware there are spiritual areas where photos are prohibited). The endless beauty, serenity and changes in the rock were unbelievable. The most beautiful place I have ever been to to date. I would love to do it all over again."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We drove from Alice Springs and back in 2 days just to see the majestic rock. It was well worth it except for the flies which I understand is a seasonal occurrence. The kids loved it and we are glad we could squeeze it in during our Australian vacation.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I have always wanted to see this massive rock and the nearby Olga's. Fantastic. We went I late Oct. Temperature was perfect and no bugs....
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So much to do!! The rock is absolutely amazing, it’s size is breathtaking, you can see it and Kata Tjuta from all over the area and the. You drive toward them and they get larger and larger. Walking around Uluru and heading and reading the history and stories is amazing, the rock paintings are incredible. The walks are so interesting, we loved every minute! Great place to visit!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did not climb the rock, there is even a register at the culture centre to record non-climbers. The culture centre is also worth visiting. The Mala walk which is a short and easy walk, was my favourite walk in Uluru. The sunset viewing was extremely popular even on a day which was not at peak photographic conditions, at the best designated spot not far from the entrance to the national park. The temperature was nice end of April, but flies were annoying, did not fancy outdoor dining with all those flies."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Really enjoyed our time here. Did some tours with AAT. They were fabulous. Do the bbq and constellation talk, Alex from AAT was brilliant and the bbq was amazing"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Absolutely fantastic tour and made great by Amy and Dylan, our tour guides and driver. Nothing was a problem . Highly recommend this company."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is in the middle of the outback. It takes a day to get there whether you fly or drive/ride. Plan to stay overnight for at least one night in the Ayers Rock resort. Despite the time and expense involved don't miss seeing Uluru. It is an experience you will remember for the rest of your life.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It was very hot the day we went. My husband (69yrs) climbed to the top. He was lucky it was 29degrees that day and not too windy. My daughter and husband climbed the day before temperatures were 37degrees and they did it tough but got to the top. All were happy they climbed, I am scared of heights and only got to what they call the chicken rock, but I climbed on the rock............ Great experience for all."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did a sunrise base walk which seemed to provide the best views of Uluru. There was a good opportunity to see the range of colours that are displayed as the sun rises. Bring your fly nets, as soon as the sun is up so are the flies!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"it's more than just a big rock, it is awesome to look at, climb (if you're lucky enough to get good weather-better hurry as it closes in October 2019), walk around. Park entry is $65 a family of 4, roads are great, photo stops are perfect. Cultural centre is very average and hasn't really been upgraded or changed much in 20 years. There is a cafe here and a souvenir shop. Nice national park though. A short 50km drive to the Olgas-more great photo stops and walks there. A helicopter flight really highlights the enormity of the rock and surrounds-put it on your bucket list. The climb is the best part, then sunrise and sunset. there are other activities here but they are outlandishly expensive and don't really seem value for money."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A beautiful, spiritual place to visit. Do many ways to see it. 3 days plenty of time to do most of it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Firstly when flying there from Sydney, choose the left side(A) and on your return journey the right side(F) of the plane to spot the Rock! For an easy highlights tour, we chose the Emu Run Kata Tjuta-Uluru Sunset Tour that took us to the popular stops allowing us to walk for around 45 mins each stop instead of walking the entire 12km base. Remember to bring fly nets, buy the larger ones from the tour information centre in town. The strongest of insect repellents are no defence against the attack of swarm of flies, even in autumn!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I have been coming to Australia for more than 20 years and have never made it to the Red Hot Centre. It is something you must do. The 12km base walk is well worth it. The only problem is the flies but you learn to deal with it with the head veils. We stayed at a Longitude 131 which included all of guides and tours and transport which was very good. You should go to experience the outback.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We recently spent a week at Yalara near Ularu and were amazed at the changing colours of the rock. Sunrise, morning, cloudy, sunset and every night was different. We broke up our exploration of Ularu over a few days and tried to see it at different times of day each visit. Early morning was our favourite time, before the tour buses, heat of the day and persistent flies become overwelming. By doing the base walk in section we were able to take more time to read the information along the way and appreciate the tranquility and spirituality of this special place. Prepare for your walks by wearing enclosed shoes, long sleeves, hat, sunscreen and ample water and a snack. By being prepared you ensure that the rest of your trip is not spoilt by an accident or trip to hospital. Try and get to one of the many lookouts around Yalara at sunrise, sunset or if the weather changes to appreciate Ularu in all its beauty."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To be able to climb Ayers Rock (Uluru) is so special, physically challenging with a sense of great achievement and an irreplaceable experience that no other activity at Uluru can offer. We were like many others, unable to climb on the first day due to wind, but were fortunate to get the green light to climb on day 2. It was by far the best part of our trip from my perspective. You cannot experience this view & the sense of awe you get from atop this magnificent natural structure which has been formed geographically as with all other historical rock formations. The fact that it happens to have formed in a land now owned by the ingenious community & governed but a small group of 12 (8 of which come from the local Anangu) seems a bit biased to me in fair decision making. I would give 5 stars if I knew that my children & their children could share in this same experience. My tip would be to rent a car, as you often need to return to the rock to see if it has opened after prior closures, as this information is not available online, nor do the resorts seem to have up to date info on it. The best time is definitely sunrise as the temperature is cooler & there are less flies & the view of the rising (just risen) sun is extraordinary (can't climb prior to sunrise)."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The photos do not do it justice. Uluru is so much more imposing and much larger than I had imagined. It was very hot when we were there and so many flies, I recommend doing the walks early in the day. We hired bikes and rode around the base. We also tried to do a sunset viewing but it was too cloudy and didn't have the light effect."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We spent a few days at the Yulara resort so managed to visit the rock a few times. We had a large group with most choosing to climb the rock which is quite steep and precarious but well worth the effort (until late October 2019). The base walk is a fantastic way to see the rock as well. Options to hire bikes and segways which, as with everything in the area, is expensive. Sunrise and sunsets viewing are well worth the effort . Awesome."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is an amazing iconic Australian landmark full of natural history and indigenous cultural heritage. The Mala walk is worthwhile, giving you an opportunity to get up close and personal with the rock itself it some advise: 1: wear a hat. 2: take loads of water 3: buy a fly head net thing 4: sunblock 5: allow more then one day. 6: Mala walk is not suitable for young kids. The rock it’s is truly awe inspiring, and we read up a little on the history before we went. But the cultural centre left a lot to be desired. The toilets smelled bad (even for toilets) and it was way over priced for things to buy. But that aside I highly recommend ticking the rock off your bucket list."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing place to visit, however learning more about the historical and cultural significance for the Anangu (local indigenous community) was very interesting. The sheer size of the rock was immense, but seeing the change in colour as the light changed was spectacular. Lots of options to get to Uluru from Yulara. The bus seemed most popular, however we hired a car as it was a little cheaper for a group of 6 and gave us an opportunity to explore at our own pace. Reasonable level of fitness required to do some of the walking tracks, especially given the temperature. We did the Wala Walk. About a 2km round journey, but got to see a number of caves and paintings, as well as a gorge. Stop and read the signs, as it gives an insight into the significance of the area."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru and Kata Tjuta in April 2019. We stayed 3 nights at the Desert Gardens hotel. The hotel breakfasts were excellent. The hotel people were helpful. There are hop on, hop off buses to Uluru ($49) and Kata Tjuta ($95). Pickups every two hours from 4 stops for Uluru. Kata Tjuta bus leaves twice a day in the morning and evening. If you have a large group it's better to hire a car (book it well in advance). If you want to climb the rock be at the start point (Mala Carpark) at 7am. If it is windy or too hot the climb will be closed. The walk around the the rock is incredible. Go early hour cos it gets very hot later on - it takes 3-4 hours. Take water, hat, sunscreen and some food. We rode a bike around the rock and it was heaps of fun. You could race around the base walk on a bike in 45-60 minutes, but I recommend getting off and checking out the waterholes. We attended the Sounds of Silence dinner which was excellent and the Field of Lights, which was ok. We drove a hire care the 50km out to Kata Tjuta for the sunset and did the Wolpa Gorge walk which was great, the Valley of the Winds walk was closed (too windy). Make sure you get a flynet ($10 or two for $15 at any of the shops at Uluru) as the flys are plentiful. There is an IGA in the Town Square which is well stocked. There's also a Petrol Station which is like a mini supermarket. Petrol is expensive - well over $2/litre. Great holiday in a very sacred place. 3 days is a good number of days to spend out there."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Tour booked via VIATOR - might be AAT-Kings tour - not sure. VIATOR sent request to review but it failed to submit!! THIS WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE ORDINARY EXPERIENCE. Same price as Sounds of Silence but not same value. (Have attended Sounds of Silence.) BBQ- meat: steak good, chicken shaslicks (apparently) good, prawns (apparently) good. NO vegetarian offering. Two tables of salads. First table FOUR salads; coleslaw, pasta salad, tossed salad and COLD potatoes. Not potato salad, not hot potatoes just COLD potatoes!!!! Second table contained a few salad dressings and a plethora of sauces for the meat. DESSERT was HALF a lamington with coulis and whipped cream. Not a pavlova in sight!! Stars visible during meal but due to the BLINDING light shining onto the tables it was almost impossible to see the stars. No secluded desert experience here. By the time we were ready for the Star Tour it was cloudy. Person presenting was quite knowledgeable but we stared at a grey blob. It is not possible to change the weather but it IS possible to check radar and have an idea of what is in store and it would have made sense to delay dessert and give the “Star Tour” while we could see the stars and then back to dessert. I should add that the staff were very friendly."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I love Uluru & have done so for many years, this was my first time visiting the NT & it did not disappoint! Viewed the rock both from up close & from a fa, the colours at sunrise & sunset are just magical! Do yourself a favour & go!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You need to be on the road at 6am to ensure you do not get stuck on heat. We had a five and eight year old who both finished walk in 3 hours and 20 minutes. If I did myself would do in less than two hours but pretty fit. Very flat and dirt all the way. Some stops but only one you Let that we found.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Iconic Australian highlight. Catch the hop on hop off bus and get up close to the Rock and see it in all its majesty. We did the sunset tour and the Sounds of Silence but they are so far away - the bus was so much better.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was concerned we were flying a long way and spending loads of money for a big red rock, but it was so much more than this. We did the Overnight Uluru Adventure with Intrepid and the whole experience was brilliant from the smoked kangaroo and emu sausages whilst watching sunset at Uluru to the aboriginal walk the next day. Our guide Dom made the whole trip informative, fun and memorable"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Absolutely beautiful it's one place I have always wanted to see. I didn't know if I would like to climb it until I was there and my answer was no it is so spiritual beautiful and amazing that I will be glad when 26 October comes and no one is allowed to climb it. I feel it is a protected place and we should do everything to protect it for future generations
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We almost cut Uluru out of our trip due to the distance, but I am so glad we didn’t. Seeing the worlds largest monolith was one of the most spectacular experiences we had on our entire trip. We did a guided tour around the rock early one morning to watch the suns rise and have some breakfast roadside."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This tour with AAT King was so poignant. Really got the feeling of the importance of Uluru to the indigenous Australian people through the stories passed down from generation to generation. The trip was made for us by Jason and Rob, our driver and guide. If in Ayers Rock you should do it! Ask for Jason and Rob too for an unbeatable experience!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We took the hop on hop off bus from our hotel to Uluru, there are different points you can be dropped off and the bus comes around approximately every 2 hours,your ticket lasts for 24 hours.We were dropped off at the waterhole and walked around the base of the rock for a few kilometeres, it was very hot so we got the next bus back to the hotel..It was a wonderful experience, we would have liked to do the 9.5 kilometres around. There is plenty to see, the caves, waterhole and the canyon and you can climb the rock if you wish,you would have to be very fit and take plenty of drinking water. We are very pleased we visited,another tick off the bucket list."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is no doubt worth visiting and worth ticking off your bucket list but I would not be interested to go again quite a unique place but the flys were unbearable so you had to cover your face hard to take good photos with your face covered intended dining under the starts but not with those flys perhaps March not the best time to go far too hot to enjoy walking around The Sails resort was the biggest disappointment definitely not 5 stars in my book and at $500 a night way over priced really needs a good reno and requests made well in advance to hotel were not fulfilled pool area very ordinary for so called 5 star
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A family holiday to visit Uluru and surrounding areas. Members of our group hoped to climb the Rock. The Park Rangers take every care to make sure conditions are suitable for the climb. Weather is critical to the conditions on an hourly basis as it can change so quickly. Our group were able to climb on the 2nd day of visiting the Park. The climb will be very memorable to each person for different reasons.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Really great site for hiking, spirituality and chilling out. The base walk was beautiful but start early. I would not do the climb very dangerous."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We used AAT Kings travel tours and drove entirely around the rock. The parts of Uluru that you are not allowed to photograph are very different from what you see in pictures. You can see petroglyphs here in the little caves around the base. Uluru sounds hollow when you tap it!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a beautiful nature wonder. Pictures can’t do it justice. The height is amazing but to walk around it, is something else.... six miles. Make sure to go at sunrise and sunset."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I did the sunrise and sunset tour of Uluru. If you have questions let me know. I booked a package deal and I would book each seperately now that I know more
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When you first see Uluru, you’ll be blown away. It’s stunning and appears to change colour depending on the time of day. Visit at both sunrise and sunset. A few things to remember - bring a fly net for your face. You may think it looks stupid but everyone wears them and you won’t regret it! It also gets really really hot by mid-morning so if you’re doing the base walk, start early. And bring at least 2L of water. It’s 10.6km and took us about 2.5hrs."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Living in Alice Springs for a few years, we visited Uluru numerous times. Each time was different and influenced by the weather, number of tourists and the accommodation. Overall a unique and wonderful experience that has definitely left many beautiful memories for our family. One time we cycled around the base. It was hot and sweaty but sensational. We still often talk about it as a unique adventure. There is always a spiritual feeling for me at Uluru and the surrounding areas. Try being still and practice 'dadirri'(deep listening) and you may experience this feeling too!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A visit to Uluru is a must for all Australians. The scenery and stories are fantastic. I would recommend the Uluru Morning Guided Base Walk, AAT Kings Tours. MJ and Verdell showed us the way and explained the features and the history. Also, AAT Kings KT Sunrise Valley of the Winds was great with Rob and Tony leading the way. This walk can be difficult in parts but certainly worth it. Don't miss the Night at Field of Light with a fantastic meal. However, be aware that on a moonlight night the lights will lose some impact. Finally, consider a helicopter flight with Ayers Rock Helicopters. It will give a completely different view of the country side. The only negative on our trip were the flies but a fashionable fly net solved that."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I loved looking at Uluru from the plane on flying in, from the minibus and on foot. Its a special place especially at sunrise and in my opinion to a lesser extent at sunset. If people are expecting tourist type facilities then there are none except in the Ayres Rock Resort."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"OK everybody prepare to be shocked I climbed Ayres Rock. A life long dream and up there with Grand Canyon , Kili, Himalayas, Siam Reap etc. These are facts NO JUDGEMENTS *Once you climb 20 metres the Olgas in majesty appear *The views of surrounds eventually become 360 degrees with views of Mt Connor and the WA ranges *Its physically taxing - but what a reward FACT 1. As the gent in the Cultural Centre told me, the owners are doing everything within their power to stop what is still a legal activity. This includes stopping walks from 8am on mornings where it it is predicted to be over 36 degrees. Other walks such as Kings Canyon and Olgas allow later starts with the proviso you are back by 11am (eg). A wind check is done at 7am and if over 25kmh the walk is cancelled (no check every 15 mins in case it drops much to the disappointment of travellers who have come far at great expense). Some travellers I spoke to waited a week to get their climb. Advice to travellers. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO CLIMB THE ROCK ALLOW A NUMBER OF DAYS. I RECOMMEND A FLEXIBLE RETURN AIRFARE FACT 2. In Australia safety is taken seriously. Signs and protective measures such as guard rails are everywhere. The climb has an initial chain but later there is nothing. I'm an adventurer but its climbers are exposed to risk. Advice to travellers - BE CAREFUL FACT 3. At the right hand side near the climb start point there are plaques to those who have died on the rock. But you can not pay respect as it is fenced and I saw a ranger tell a person not to go inside.. Advice to travellers.TAKE BINOCULARS IF YOU WISH TO READ THE PLAQUES FACT 4.Climbing the rock is legal FACT 5. Climbing the rock is not legal from Oct 19. Advice to travellers. IF YOU WANT TO CLIMB GO SOON FACT 5. The climb was packed with foreign tourists exuberant to put the Adventure back in Outback Adventure"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Beautiful site, very hot, even for Texans. Lots of ""heritage site"" rules and restrictions, including limits on photography."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Lived in Australia all my life and this is the first time I have made it to the Red Centre, it is totally amazing and for me a spiritual experience. No matter how many time we visited, I always had that surreal experience. Sunset is gorgeous, a couple of the walks show you more than you thought. Just majestic."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A must see while in Australia, the Uluru experience is amazing. I suggest only a few days though, because between the flies (they don’t bite) and the 105 F temperatures, the fun runs out fast"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is not to be missed. We had a wonderful guide who explained so much to us about the aboriginal culture. It was one of the best stops on the trip. Please do no climb Uluru, although it is allowed, it is considered sacred to the tribes."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is stunning. We did the complete 10km circuit of the rock on a warm cloudless day. Be prepared, take water hats and sun cream. The walk is flat on good paths, and for the most part stays close to the rock. There are fantastic areas of weathered rock, like an ocean wave, and aboriginal art work on the rock. Hire a car to have the freedom to do sunrise, sunset and the walk at your leisure. A must."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We viewed Uluru at sunset. I've read that Uluru is the most photographed attraction in Australia. I can see why this is so after our visit. As the sun set, the Rock was bathed in warm sunlight that revealed and highlighted the folds in the rock. A wonderful view!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Go see this at sunrise and sunset - walk around the base - listen to the stories , this is an amazing and wonderful place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To truly appreciate Uluru, you should do some hiking in addition to just observing the sunrise and/or sunset. To walk around the base, is a 10k endeavor. It takes about 3 hours but it is definitely worth it. You get really close-up to Uluru. We started hiking around 5:30 and ended at 8:30. The earlier you start, the earlier you finish since the temperature can get to more than 40 degrees. Make sure you wear a hat with fly net. The flies here not only stand on your hair, face, clothing but also buzz the whole way which is annoying. If you want to start hiking at 5:30am, you should find the entrance the day before when you watch the sunset. It would be difficult to find the entrance in the dark at 5:30am. The weather at 5:30 is really nice with a breeze. You would have to schedule another trip to watch the sunrise since when you walk around the base, you lose out on the whole view of Uluru."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You know you are going to see a large rock BUT until you get to see it with your own eyes you just don't realise how big and spectacular this place is.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The “Rock” is much bigger than I thought it was and close up it is an impressive thing to see. The park area surrounding this site is very impresive with lots dne to make sure it remains a top attraction despite it also being a very important site for the indigenous people of Australia. We did both the sunrise and sunset trips as well as daytime. The only thing I would say is that the sunrise and sunset trips are hyped up a bit as the colour of the rock does not change but does alter shade, unlike the Northern Lights which are spectacular. However don’t let this put you off as if you are visiting Australia you have to see this iconic sight. Two nights in this area was more than enough."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I stayed in the youth hostel a few years ago as it was low season and I did a sunset and sunrise trip so I didn't think it was worth the extra £100 for a private room for a few hours. The basic hotel rooms share the same shower/WC block as the YH and were further away. I was alone in my section of the YH. The whole 'resort' is linked by a free bus so you can go to the shop or restaurants in the other hotels but the bottle shop was on the YH site so we had plenty of visitors. It was a 10 minute walk across to the other hotels. There was also live entertainment at the YH and a huge kitchen where you could keep your drinks cool and cook if you wished. The pool was OK but isn't what you go there for although you are allowed to use the facilities at all 'resort' properties. The tour buses to Uluru take your name and residence to ensure nobody gets stranded at the rock. I'd recommend if you get the chance.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The park is very interesting. Olgas rocks, look different from different places and it is very interesting. Watching Ayers Rock at sunset and the next day at sunrise and seeing its changing colors is a great experience. The old frescoes are also very fascinating and of course all the legends about Ayers Rock. When we visited it was hot and the flies were annoying, but nevertheless you can enjoy it very much. In our opinion, it is advisable to get there with a local guide who knows all the places and can explain well."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"First things first. I don’t believe there was a “perfect” spot to see Uluru from as each angle shows something new and unexpected! We saw it from the sky, sunrise and sunset, biked around it and even climbed to the top and all provided a unique experience and prospective. Based on what we saw I would highly recommend planning on an early morning and sunset activity as many of the areas were shut down after 11 due to heat. We spent 3 days exploring and thought it was about right for us. Biggest tip I can give anyone is to make sure you bring fly netting for your face. If you don’t you will be either swatting flies the whole time or buying netting at one of the local stores. Doesn’t look the greatest but works well!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Lifetime pictures cannot enable you to kepp your breath at the first view, and even after that. Truly magnificant and unique. Water on the rock extra special."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If one travels to Australia, then this is a must-see. It's a sacred place for the Aborigines and it's clearly mystical and magical, especially when Uluru's color starts changing at sunset. As of May, it will be forbidden to climb the rock. Still, there are many hikes you can take in the park (either for Uluru or Kata Tjuta), go on camel safaris, helicopter flights, overnight camping Temperatures in the summer go above 40º so the best time is either early morning or sunset and prepare yourself for the heat"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We arrived here on a tour with EMU Run. the area was great to view, and an experience (it was one of the highlights of our Australia trip, and great pictures from sunset). Location was well organized, with lots of useful sign boards."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We had an amazing time visiting Uluru we saw it at sun set & sun rise we visited the visitor centre too really amazing & informative.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is a magical place and should be on everyone’s bucket list. I suggest staying in Alice Springs and taking a guided tour from there. The motels around Uluru are ridiculously expensive and the the lower prices in Alice Springs more than offsets the cost for the guided tour from that location.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"went for a drive one week up to ayers rock (uluru), had a heap of rain so we thought it may not be so much of a desert, what a surprise we were in for, the ""desert"" was in ""paradise"" mode. wild flowers everywhere, trees in blossom, emus and kangaroos all over the joint, little spiny devils were wandering everywhere, camels were very close to the road and birds all over the place......and the colours, my god we were blown away, reds and greens and the sky so blue. then the rock loomed in the distance, it took our breath away it just got bigger and bigger and redder the closer we got, the uluru campground is basic and costly but serviceable, meals in the ""township"" are basic and costly and the ""entrance fee"" is very costly and cheeky high cost of maintaining a rock nowadays apparently, cant climb the thing nowadays, locals dont like it even though they have been doing it for thousands of years, the walk around the base is a stretch but very rewarding. their is a definite ""spirit of place"" here....sacred ground is felt everywhere, dont take any souvenirs or the rock will follow you."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Go to the Wintjiri Arts Center whenever Karl B is giving his talk. We learned so much. He has a gallery in Alice Springs and his aunt and mother were part of the beginning of the indigenous art movement. Wintjiri also has an artist in residence and great things to buy as well as information on the Rock/whole area.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Visiting the Uluru (Ayers Rock) in the Australian outback was one of those unforgettable experiences! We went there with our own campervan. Drove around the viewpoints and did the base walk (10km - about 3-4 hours hike) to circuit the rock. At sunrise and sunset choose a good viewpoint. We really liked the Uluru and can't wait to come back one day.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After visiting our son in Brisbane Angie and I flew out to ULURU, to fulfil one of Angies childhood dreams to visit this holy monolith. As our plane descended over the desert, the majestic mountain came into view. We checked into the Emu Walk Apartments large spacious room, with living room and kitchenette. That evening we were taken to view ULURU, painted by the glorious colours of the setting sun ULURUs colour changes with each phase of the setting sun. We were served wine and tit bits as were gazed at and were amazed by Gods tapestry. An elderly lady taught me how to capture on camera an inverted image of ULURU as seen through a wine glass I was grateful to her for the experience. It was getting rather chilly, once the sun set and we made our back to our hotel. We looked for dinner but though western cuisine was easy to find, there was little Asian food only one person was selling noodles to me this was a rip off just some noodles with no vegetables or meat. Early the next morning we were taken back to view ULURU coloured by the morning sun again we were amazed by Gods handiwork I had little doubt that this was one of His homes on earth, and I supported all the native people who feel ULURU deserves all the respect we could give without insulting her by walking all over her. We returned to our apartments for breakfast and later set out to explore the desert and other monoliths in the area on the Kuniya Walk. Our guide pointed out caves and cave paintings by the native people. The sun painted the surrounding mountains in hues of red, orange and yellow. During the walk we were assailed but many flies and had great difficulty in preventing them from getting into our mouths, nostrils and ears we had come ill prepared head nets would have helped us so much. Once back at the hotel I came across a photography exhibition and bought a beautiful print that I admired so much this was a photograph of the Red Bank Gorge the photographer had waited patiently as the sun rose in the sky to capture the perfect moment when the sides of the gorge glowed in bright orange, blue and brown ; the photograph also captured the reflection of the gorge in the lake below. We then explore a small supermarket attached to the apartments and were pleasantly surprised by Haldrdirams pre packed Indian vegetarian food that night we had a feast the Basmati rice and chapattis were simply first class as were the sauces that went along. I also discovered Imalung lookout point which was about a kilometre walk from the apartments this enabled me more views of ULURU and other monoliths in the distance I took more setting sun pictures and got up before sunrise the following morning to catch the rising sun. Later that morning we were taken on a walk about around the apartments and shown various dessert flowers and edible fruits by a native elder. We then caught the evening flight back to Brisbane."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"National Geographic assured that there would be considerable flexibility and that it was, in fact, as the name implied, a ""private excursion"". It was not. Neither was it luxurious. The Shangri La Hotels were subpar both in Sydney and in Cairns. Our flight connections were torturous. At one location we had a four-hour layover despite the fact that planes departed for our next destination every two hours.We asked to switch and were told that we held a special low-rate ticket that did not permit changes. We had to wait. Thank-you National Geographic. Yet, the biggest problem was the need to wake and eat on someone else's schedule. Getting up before 6:00 in the morning on a vacation is ridiculous. Yet, travel and tour plans dictated such a schedule. We were told to be ready 15 minutes early, and we were. Then the drivers were late, creating stress and resentment. Furthermore, dinner was generally served too late for me to eat it. I was able to make special arrangements to eat dinner before 7:00, but in doing so, ate alone each night. I incorrectly believed that my access to the wonderful resorts on Kangaroo Island and Lizard Island was dependent upon my booking the trip through National Geographic, an understanding fostered by the literature and conversations I had prior to the trip. Of course, anyone can stay at these resorts. Moreover, the trip to Uluru was a complete waste of time. There is nothing there to see or to do, it is hard to get to, it is hot and full of flies."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There are better looking hills than this one around the world. But, some Australian entrepreneurs have managed to get this as a ""must-see"" for various tours and the Australian psyche. Don't get me wrong, seeing the outback was interesting. Seeing the aborigines in the area was depressing, in spite of the happy talk surrounding their heritage. But, I think an honest presentation as to what is in this area would be helpful."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Very interesting. Make sure you visit the cultural center (would be good to do first). You can’t photograph/film certain parts of Uluru for cultural reasons, good to have some type of guide to tell you that type of information (there are signs, too). Bring and drink water- it’s hot and there’s not a lot of shade. Best to go in the early AM or PM."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This was one of my big things to cross off my list! Lets put a big... no huge tick here. Ive seen some things and. Wentto some great places but nothing beats this! Its more than just a monolith in the middle of australia! Its the heart of it! You certainly feel it when your there!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Beautiful from afar and fascinating up close. We watched the sunrise and sunset (but they were a bit of a let down, not even close to what you see in the brochures). We also did the full base walk around Uluru, starting at Mala carpark and going clockwise. Took around 3 hours in extreme 43 degree heat. Start the walk early, take plenty of water. Great to see the different facets and sides of Uluru."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's never been on my ""to do list"" however circumstances led to a quick trip to see ""The Rock"" and I'm so happy I did. What a surreal, beautiful place to visit! It truly is worth a trip, I also had the opportunity to view these incredible landmarks via helicopter with Ayers Rock Helicopters which was amazing and very informative. A great destination for one or a family."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,An amazing vision that tests the senses. Best seen early morning or late afternoon. Was surprised at the amount of vegetation around the base perimeter. The non officially photographed (eastern) side is more interesting with its water hole and ability to walk right next to the rock .
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visiting Uluru was a magical experience. We got to experience sunset from afar, and then sunrise up close on a walk around the base. It's completely different from the far away pictures when up close, so there's lots to explore. We also enjoyed seeing Aboriginal art in caves and had a talk led by an Aborigine which was fascinating. Honestly, it's such a beautiful place that everyone should get to when visiting Australia."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We definitely reccomend this tour and we loved our tour guide, Alex. He was very informative and made the trip around the rock very fun. We were thankful for the cold water on board to fill up our bottles and the sunset was gorgeous. The champagne and dukka spiced bread was a tasty treat."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Everyone that visits Australia should have the opportunity to see this unique feature and see the outback.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,As I'd won this part of my 'lifetime trip' this place was absolutely awesome. Forgotten our tour guides names and yes they knew their stuff about this glorious location. If you're someone who's spiritual I'd highly recommend this place as it is a 'Must-do' bucket list item. We enjoyed the tour around the base and would do this again.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We were in the area two nights and experienced thunder, lightening, clear skies, grey skies. Amazing how the rock changes (and the desert). We walked round the rock (three hours) which was great and an ideal to see it in all its glory as well as study the significance of the site (helpful information boards). We were lucky because the rain had dropped the temperature and I wouldn't recommend the walk on hot days."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We took the hop on hop off transfer service and ranger walk. Both were ok but the ranger really needs some training in how to deal with the public. He lost half of the group as we was so ponderous. If we were to do this next time we’d hire a car, go to the cultural centre and do your own walks. You’d see much more of the area too."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We travelled on this tour with our guide Dan and Driver Rob on 8/1/19. We were so blown away with their professionalism and customer focus. We were picked up from our accommodation right on time and given our breakfast bags. Dan helped us with our National Park tickets and then off we went. Seeing Uluru in the emerging daylight was just so exciting. Once we arrived Dan explained everything to us - including respecting the areas were weren't allowed to photograph. He told us so many amazing stories as we walked along. The significance of the caves in particular were magical. Half way around we got to enjoy our breakfast with lovely tea and coffee and stools provided by Rob. I was sad to see people climbing the rock when the Aboriginal people asked that they didn't do so. We completed the balance of the 13km in the heat but the stories were so magical we didn't really notice. AAPT do such a great job on this tour. I can't recommend it highly enough.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great experience, nice people, rich culture, wonderful sunrise and sunset, an excellent get away to reset ourselves and connect with the nature. It's the first time I saw millions of stars shinning brightly at night and milky way! The Uluru and Kata Tjuta are both amazingly stunning with lots of nice walking trails (different levels of difficulty) for those who are a bit more adventurous. Definitely worth a visit!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is the best site of our trips in Australia. At the beginning, we were not sure if it would be worth all the efforts to go all the way to visit it. Now we are very pleased that we made the efforts and experienced something once a life time! The landscape is unique and breath-taking. We learnt about the aboriginal culture, the life of aboriginal people and their connections to the land. We've taken so many beautiful photos and nice memories."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Every Australian should see Uluru at least once in their lifetime. It is just so huge. The walk around the base is very interesting especially if someone can guide you.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The base walk is quite long and if you start too late in the day, it’s hot and the sun will be in your eyes for most of it. If you go clockwise from the Mala carpark before sunrise, the sun will be out of your eyes by the time it rises, and you’ll get to see the more attractive parts of the rear side of the rock (the Lungkata section) in front of you rather than having to always look back. The walk is over 2 hours and gets a bit tedious towards the end due to it being less interesting and further away from the rock itself (especially if you go counter clockwise). If you’re looking for a shorter walk which incorporates the most interesting parts of the rock, I’d recommend doing the Mala walk, then drive around to the Kuniya car park to see the waterhole and rock drawings, and then walking a little way along the Lungkata walk, being sure to look behind you, as this is some of the most spectacular parts of the rock. Climbing is not respectful of the local custodians of the land, and is quite dangerous. A man died climbing it in the last 12 months."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a great natural wonder - must visit -- don't miss the sunset and sunrise, If you are able to climb, do the climb too unless its really hot weather."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"OK it is a tourist (expensive) trap, and unless you really want to walk in serious heat, probably avoid. Yes dramatic in the middle of nowhere, but all the resorts are owned by the same hotel chain in Ayers Rock resort, and everything is trucked in from Adelaide, so expect to pay - for a lump of rock in the middle of the outback! And forget the colour change at sunrise - just gets lighter as the sun comes up. Great marketing!!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's always a challenge to see the most iconic places in the World. We have all seen so many images over the years we find the the reality can be disappointing. I wouldn't say that was the case with Uluru but I guess it depends on your point of view. It certainly pays to see this amazing feature up close, as the sun rises or sets to see it change colors and shadows. It also pays to view it at other times - there is something majestic about the way it towers over the surrounding landscape as you see it for the first time, or from one of the distant viewing points as it shimmers in the summer heat. It is very impressive in my opinion. The various tours one can take to see it are, of course, over-priced. I am not religious or spiritual but I respect the desire of those who would rather tourists didn't climb Uluru and I would never do so. I don't get any feeling of this as a ""spiritual place"" as I don't even know what that means as nobody ever seems to be able to define what they mean by that phrase but I am very glad to have visited this impressive place for myself."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was taken to Uluru to photograph sunset and sunrise with 'See It tours' the guide, Monty, he not only made it a wonderful experience he was very knowledgeable he was cute too"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The sunset or the sunrise...a must see for all Australian’s. We also flew over to see amazing views. You don’t need to join a formal tour if you have a car you can drive out to the national park between 5am and 9pm to see Uluru (Ayers Rock). It is only about 30 mins from Yulara resort.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"As a long desired place to visit,I finally made it.Would have preferred to do it when I was younger.But better late than never. It exceeded all my expectations and to feel the spirituality of the place was amazing as I am not normally the type.Just this massive red rock,pocked with holes,channels running down and crumbling surfaces.Just sitting there ,so happy to have seen it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru/Kata-Tjuta National Park for two days and did just about every hike in Uluru and Kata-Tjuta. The formations are amazing, the desert is peaceful and enchanting. And the cultural center is well worth a couple hours of reading and talking to members of the Ananou community. A trip of a lifetime!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Fantastic experience to see, touch and learn about the “Rock”. You cannot climb now but that does not take away the charm and experience. A Bucket List tick that is a ‘must do’."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Original we went to Uluru to climb it as a family,as I had climbed it already 40 years ago. Now I see it differently, as by the end of this trip it really didn't matter whether I climbed it or not. The Aboriginal significance, as environmental damage it does to the upper levels of the rock must be taken into account. (ie The Shield Shrimp in pools on the top must be preserved). It really doesn't matter,as the rock itself has allot to offer. We did the Mala Walk followed by the base walk, to take in the size and Ora of the rock. I'm happy I didn't climb as now I appreciate the rock for what it is, an ICON OF AUSTRALIA. The older photos show how it was."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Disappointing waste of time. Expensive to get in and you can only go for a 3 day pass. They close the the walk up over nothing. Can only walk up between 6:30am and 8am. You have to be there to see if you're allowed up. Can't look on a website so you don't have to waste your time. The walk around the bottom is boring and lacks information about the people, rock and area. You get more information at the rest stops on the highway (and they're free). Drove over 3500kms to walk up before its closed. Told I couldn't go up over a 10km wind. I'm a qualified mountain/climb guide. What a joke."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Thank you Seit and Sol our Nepali! guide. Fabulous sunset trip . Great atmosphere. Perfect evening. Hi
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Obviously if you're the area- you've come to see Uluru. The first glimpse is amazing, and the closer you get the more amazing it is. We decided to do the base walk- but my advice is- if you have limited time - just do the main walks near Mala carpark. I didn't really enjoy the whole base walk. First- it was very hot. Unfortunately there are not many rest stops along the way- which is odd given the harsh weather.... a few extra seats/rest areas would make all the difference. One whole side of the rock is basically a ""sacred site"" so the walking track is detoured a whole way out and no photographs are allowed- you're so far from the rock you can get the same view driving past. If you do intend to do the whole base walk- go early in the summer months, by 11am it is unbearable. Take plenty of water & sunscreen. No need for hiking boots- sneakers are fine on the gravel track. The climb is much steeper than i imagined (we didn't do it) - it closes at 8am in summer and i believe as of 2019 it will be banned forever."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The sight of Uluru from near and far is magical. It is the largest single rock in the planet. More of it exists underground than above. Don’t miss sunset and sunrise viewings. Within an hour, the color of the Rock changes dramatically. The best is when the sun lights up the rock and it glows in the outback. When you get to the lookout viewpoint, escape from the crowds. There is good viewing from anywhere. Don’g Forget to bring a bottle of champagne for a toast. Makes for wonderful photos."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Definitely lives up to all the hype. We did the sunset tour as well as the walk at the base. Both are worth it. Be prepared for flies, and go early to minimize the heat. We were on a tour so they arranged for the guide on our base walk. Our guide, Leroy, was great and definitely made our walk special."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Great place with a lot to see and do. We did the base walk as well as the Climb of Ayers Rock which were both great. The climb was a once in a lifetime thing with great views in all directions from the top The cultural center has a lot of interesting material as well. In total the Uluru-Kata area is a must do if in the area.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No, not Dwayne ! Talking about one of the worlds largest monoliths ! A very uplifting sight for all to enjoy and be it morning, noon or night it gives a different character to view ! I've tried to climb it twice and for differing reasons it's the Rock 2 , Me Zip ! But just maybe , it's meant to be looked at & admired ? Either way , it's the Worlds Rock to enjoy and marvel at, not just us Aussies !!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When innAustralia this is a must, but it is alo very well organized. Several viewing areas platforms for sunset and sunrise, for tiuring cars and private travellers , and dozens of different ours during daytime."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I’ve always had a great desire to see Ayer’s Rock and I wasn’t disappointed. We booked a Deluxe Rock View room at the Desert Gardens and it was well worth it. The views from the room were great! Due to rain and lighting, the Field of Light Star tour was cancelled but the lighting show over the rock was fantastic. The following morning we went on a small-group sunrise tour with SEIT tours. We pulled off the paved road and drove down a dirt road about 3 miles near the “rock “, parked, and ate a delicious breakfast while waiting for the sunrise. Uluru shimmered red in the sun and was exactly what I was expecting. We then walked into the rock formation itself along a trail for about a half-hour. We saw the beautiful Mutitjulu waterhole being fed by last night’s rains and Aboriginal rock art. Due to the rain last night washing off much of the iron oxide (that’s what gives Uluru its distinctive red coloring), the rock was mostly gray during the day, but still very impressive. That evening we went for the sunset Sounds of Silence dinner. Unfortunately, the rain cleared out much of the dust and washed the rock so we didn’t get the magnificent sunset view you typically see in photographs. The dinner was very good and samples of barramundi, kangaroo, emu and crocodile were also served. The star show was disappointing – mainly because we saw many of the same constellations we see in the Northern hemisphere and the fact that the Southern Cross hadn’t risen yet. Between the airfare from Sydney, room at the resort, and tours, the whole trip was expensive, but in my estimation was well worth it!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Such an impressive and iconic Australian landscape. The sunset and sunrise views are amazing. Definitely recommend doing a walk / cycle tour around the base of Uluru.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru really is magical. The history of the aboriginal people who used to teach their young and prepare food in the shelter of the rock is sacred. The carvings and formations of the rock are captivating. We reccommend sunset and sunrise to see uluru in its most beauty. Make sure to take a walk around, try go early to beat the heat and crowds. Please be aware you shouldn't climb this rock as it is against the traditional laws of its owners. Soon the option to climb will be permanently closed anyway. There is a resort overlooking uluru which looks quite nice but if you are a budget backpacker like us, there is a free camp just a few k's before the entrance. Try get there early enough after sunset as it gets busy."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The National Park is a huge rip off at $25/person for entry and very little to do inside. There are two geological formations in the park: Ayers Rock (which they now want us to call “Uluru”) and the Olgas (another rock formation). There are basically four ways to enjoy the park: (1) sit on one of 3-4 platforms throughout the park and stare at the rocks; (2) take one of two short hikes in the Olgas, (3) spend several hours walking around the base of Ayers Rock, or (4) climb Ayers Rock. We did (or tried to do) all four, and none were particularly memorable or worth the visit. Viewing Platforms: The viewing platforms were extremely poorly positioned—you can’t even see the sunrise from the so-called sunrise viewing platform. If you search for pictures of sunrise over Uluru or Ayers Rock, you see a lot of pictures with the rock and the sun rising to one side, not the view you get at the platform at all. Worth going to snap a picture, but not worth a trip to the dessert. Hikes: They Valley of the Winds hike is frequently closed due to heat. We rushed the day we arrived to make it there before 11am when they close it. It was a nice little hike, but not challenging at all. The brochures said it would take 4 hours, we finished in 2 at a fast but leisurely pace. It would be worth traveling to the area if there were more hikes, but that’s really the only one. Base Walk: We did part of the base walk but got bored and turned back. All you’re doing is walking on a flat path around the walk. Not challenging, not intellectually stimulating, and you don’t even get good views of Ayers Rock because you’re next to it. Climb: The aboriginal people worship Ayers Rock and so they don’t like it when people climb it, though climbing is still permitted. Problem is, there’s very little information about the climb and they frequently close it for no apparent reason. The first day it was closed after 8am due to extreme heat (the temperature was forecast to hit 36 degrees, but it never got that hot). The second day it was closed all day due to a potential for rain. When we were there at 7am it was blue skies with a few fluffy white clouds, yet the climb was closed because there was a possibility of rain that evening. There is no communication about when it will or won’t be open, so you can’t plan ahead and you can’t predict based on the weather. Overall, we were sorely disappointed in not being able to climb, mainly because there weren’t other challenging hikes (or really anything else to do). We ended up at the pioneer bar at the resort instead of in the park, and although it was a nice bar, not worth a $1000 trip. We’ve visited multiple National Parks in Australia (Queensland, Tasmania) and this was by far the most disappointing. The visitor information was poor; it seems like the aboriginal people that now run the park want the money from tourism but want people to stay at the nearby resorts instead of actually visiting the park."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Astro Tour run at Uluru is a quick talk about finding a few stars, some stories and looking through the telescope (on the night we saw Mars, Saturn and a few galaxies). At $50.00 per person this is one of the most expensive astro tours and is not worth the money. There's nothing here that you would not be able to see at your local astronomy group. This is run behind a car park...."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My husband and I walked around, we decided to start early (6am) and I’m glad we did as the afternoon got hot. We just missed the sunrise but the morning glow was still beautiful. This huge rock dwarfs you and from all its angles it takes your breath away. On our last night in Uluru we were lucky enough to watch an electric storm go over the rock - definitely a memorable moment which we watched it from the sunset viewing platform."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Both were amazing in different ways. Sunrise tour (430a-930a)- viewed sunrise at 515a; stopped for coffee/tea & cereal and toast. Then walked thru the valley of winds (Walpa Gorge) beautiful!! Sunset tour (330-9p) walked around base of Uluru; learned history; saw sunset at Minymaku platform with sparkling wine and bread.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"whenever you see it the color is different according to sun. hugh rock, some climb it on their own risk. beautiful on sunset and dawn"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A wonderful experience seeing the rock in person, I really loved my time there. It truly is impressive and witnessing it during the day and the changing colours at sunset amazing. My wife and I enjoyed the different experiences available - walking around the base, cycling around the base, the displays at the cultural centre and were fortunate enough to do the climb on a fine day. The first part of the climb up the chain was a bit strenuous but then it became much easier - amazing views from the top, a unique and memorable experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After driving back and forth, we found the official platform and the panoramic view of the Uluru or Ayers Rock was simply indescribable, he is humongous, strong, powerful, dominant. We were able to take very good photos and videos. We drove further and stopped at the following sites: Kuniya Piti, Tjukatjapi, Ngaltawata, Warayuki, all are sacred sites. The signage were quite confusing as there are sides left or right where photography and videography was not allowed but that really depends in which angle or distance you are taking photos or videos, nobody follows this sacred rule. We took a short walk at the Mala Walk and got closer with this natural masterpiece. There were a lot of travelers from all kinds, backpackers, seniors, independent just like us, a lot of Chinese and Vietnamese, AAT Tours, Segway motors. Everybody was anticipating for the sunrise but the sun didn’t rise this time. But it was all okay, the wild panoramic view of the mighty Uluru was enough. On our third day, we drove again to the Talinguru Nyakunytjaku Sunrise Viewing Area. It was crowded but they left immediately. What a lovely sunset and a magical Uluru. It has a different charm during sunrise and we were lucky today to witnessed this. The rays of sun through the rock was very beautiful. The patchwork of color of the rock together with the whole park was awe inspiring. A different shades of best red during sunrise."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Missed the sunrise due to rain and lightning, but still spectacular, and it doesn't rain out here often enough to make it a common event. If you have a bucket list you're working your way through, this should be on it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Don’t get me wrong, Uluru itself is impressive! It is red and huge, with many intriguing caves and turns. It is inviting and you just wish you could climb and explore it. Or even have a drone to fly up to it. We are a family of five, with children ranging from 4 to 10. We do a lot of walking, so readily choose to walk around the base of Uluru. At first we were excited, as the path hugged the base of Uluru and there was lots to see and explore. However, as you walk around the base, the further you get away from it. After a while, it is like walking in the distance of the rock, it the heat and sun, with limited change in the scenery. It was extremely disappointing, especially with young children. In retrospect we should have just driven to the key points of the rock and explored them or hired some bikes. Walking around the rock with no pram and small children, is not worth it. Kings Canyon Rim Walk and The Valley of the Winds are much better options, than the base walk of Uluru."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We weren’t sure what to expect however Uluru appears more a mountain range than a single rock. It’s awe inspiring and you can touch it. We chose a tour of sunset and sunset both with meals and both were fabulous in every detail. It’s pricey but worth every penny. A real must do off our bucket list.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I just arrived back from a few days at Uluru spent with my wife and a friend couple. Whilst I have never had a compelling desire to see the “rock” I was so pleased I did. It was much more impressive than I believed. The stories of aboriginal culture including bush tucker, hunting, land management, and dreamtime were just fantastic! The cost for this trip was not cheap compared to say SE Asia holidays, but given that everything must be transported into this remote site, it is somewhat understandable. The Sails in the Desert where we stayed was good with reasonable service standards, whilst not being exceptional. The rooms were large enough, clean, and comfortable. The hotel restaurants were good, but don’t expect 5-star cuisine. The staff were very friendly but not without fault in terms of speed of service. The Yulara “town” seems to struggle a touch to deal with the substantial tourist flows which seem to come from all corners of the world. Overall, Australia should be proud of the site, the aboriginal heritage associated with it, and the management of it. We booked a couple of the tours and plenty of the free aboriginal culture sessions which were all great. However, the field of lights we found somewhat contrived and underwhelming. We had a great time and I was so glad I got to see this magnificent geological and cultural icon."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,My son and i went as it has been on the bucket list. We had a fantastic time. We even got to see it in the rain with waterfalls. Put it on your list its Amazing. The base walk is aprox 10km but we hired bikes and did it in aprox 1 hour 45. Its an easy ride.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Rising from the plains of the Australian outback is this prehistoric monolithical masterpiece. Uluru, the undeniable crowning centrepiece of our great southern land. Take a bus to the base of this extraordinary structure and take your time to walk around its 12-km circumference. What makes it so wonderful is, every two or three hundred metres the natural patination, colour and sounds change. Indigenous stories that date back through the millennia told on the walls of the many visually accessible caves. We were fortunate to arrive minutes are a rain storm and were treated to the wonders of instant waterfalls and the whaling of native frogs. A spiritual and very special indeed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"On arrival into the national park, you are amazed at the size of Uluru in the distance. We hired push bikes and cycled around the base. Stopping to admire waterholes, rock art and read about some of the local indigenous history. Uluru is an amazing place to visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Spent a few days around but unfortunately not enough for the olgas. Uluru is amazing though and you really feel the importance of the site.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Be sure if you are travelling in the Australian outback that you do not miss one of the most mesmerising and enchanting places in Australia. The Aboriginal stories, the size and location of this natural wonder of our world deserves a visit to see for yourself. amazing!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Spent a couple of days touring Uluru the local aboriginal cafe serves the best iced coffee I have tasted so far on on our tor of Australia. Not to be missed
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru as a somewhat elderly couple. We had wanted to fly over the rock but asking at the tourist place one firm had no spaces for that day ( without first checking ) and the other place said their computer was down. So we went on a coach which dropped us off and picked us up at various places. There is a 25 Australian dollar entrance to the park which we were more than happy to pay. It being October it wasn’t that hot, a mere 33 degrees . My husband walked round the rock itself and I walked a couple of trails. The rock can still be climbed in places but we decided not to out of respect. It is a magnificent natural wonder . I would not think it suitable for kids as there isn’t much else to do although there were quite a few camper vans around and people cycling. I assume they were visiting as part of a larger road trip. I am very glad I saw this iconic sight."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This magnificent rock never disappoints. We did sunrise and sunset and cycled around it. Just mesmerising.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow! What a beautiful place. Such ancient spiritualty mixed with shear outback beauty. We stayed at Ayres Rock Resort camp grounds in our camper. Prices were relatively high but to be expected when you are beyond a stones throw from nowhere. Staff were incredible and facilities clean and tidy. We rode around the rock with outback cycling and climbed the rock as a family. Be warned that the rock is seemingly mostly closed for climbing with rangers evaluating whether to open the climb at 7am, 8am, 10am,12pm and 2pm... Take heaps of water with you and dress for our Aussie environment."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru has always been on my bucket list, but I was not entirely sure what to expect of a giant monolith in the middle of the desert. I am pleased to report that it was so much more. We enjoyed the walk around the base, the aboriginal stories, the shock of finding waterholes in the middle of the desert and the cave paintings. We were also lucky enough to join a talk by an aboriginal guide and learned alot about the local plants and wildlife, including her keen eyes spotting a monitor lizard up on the rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Travelling to Uluru and Kata Tjuta was an unforgettable experience for our family. It really is difficult to put the experience into words. You must see it for yourselves. It is however important to visit the Cultural Centre before you visit Uluru to gain an understanding of it's significance to the peaceful Anangu people who called this place their home for thousands of years. I don't believe you could possibly do the climb once you open your eyes to this..in fact I truly cannot understand why people still choose to climb. Take a guided tour as well and learn more about the significance of several areas of the rock, including areas you are forbidden for photographing. Our ranger explained that climbers leave rubbish at the top of the rock which flows into water systems when it rains and 35 people have died climbing as well. I only wish the climb was already closed, as the rock has been destroyed in the area where walkers have trampled and poles have been erected to support them. While you are there, you must also travel out to Kata Tjuta. This was an amazing surprise, I had no idea it was so much larger than Uluru and just as breathtaking. Incredible. Don't miss it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We hired a car at the resort and used this to visit Uluru each day of our visit, which was a good option for a family. Uluru was amazing, definitely living up to expectations. Walking tracks are well maintained and with informative signposting. Ranger walks are offered free each day but can be overcrowded and a little slow-moving, especially for kids. Even though we visited in September, daily temperatures were already over 30C every day, so early morning or late afternoon trips worked best for us to avoid the heat. There is a spiritual quality at Uluru for those who take the time to appreciate it. Surprisingly, many tourists are still climbing the rock each day. Out of respect, and for safety, we chose not to. A sunset viewing is highly recommended, but get to the designated viewing area early to secure a spot. An imposing and impressive monolith definitely worth visiting."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Can be very short: Uluru was on our bucket list, don’t miss this impressive iconic red mountain with great sunsets and sun rises, do the base basewalk early mornings. (We visited in February hot 41++ degrees season) It's overall an overwelming experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayers Rock is quite a magical place. It is much more impressive up close. New had an Australian native that was very entertaining and informative. He made it easier to understand the significance of this historic place. It is a UNESCO site. It can ge quite hot so go early. Plan at least an hour for this visit.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You cannot easily describe the enormous rock and how powerful it sits in its environment. To think it is 6km deep! The climb was close due to high winds but it looked quite dangerous anyway. If you want to see it in its full glory, take a helicopter flight. Thats the best."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru and were keen to maximise our cultural and evolutionary understanding of the rock. We thought a guided Segway tour would be a good way to hear about it. This was a very disappointing option as the Segways are set to travel at not much faster than walking speed and the quality of the information provided was poor. We separately hired bikes (at a quarter of the price) and rode around the rock (a fun exhilarating experience), stopping to read the information posted, and went on the free ranger guided tours, which provided much better information."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We travelled from the UK to be able to see this Icon of the Spirit of Australia! And it so did not let us down as you could feel the atmosphere of the Aboriginal Culture all around. The sunrise was enthralling and we took dozens of pictures to remind us of our visit. Anyone with any desire to learn about the history of Australia should make the effort to visit Uluru.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The sheer enormousness of the area was awesome. Walking around the rock, the guided tour and the sunset/sunrise were all a must do and see. The sky was filled with stars and was an added benefit to the trip."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"they say this rock has ""spirit of place"".....they are dead right the feeling of approaching Uluru is something akin to entering a church, the soul feels at home it certainly is ""sacred ground"" we walked around the base on a reasonably warm day, its a long way but my god what a way to feel and see the rock....we didnt climb but I dont feel as if we missed out on anything, the waterholes and the dreamtime stories surrounding this place must be seen to be believed"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is an experience that should be on every Australians ''Bucket List'. When approaching out of the desert region this monolith seems to take on an ethereal nature. You can understand why the indigenous people of Australia have revered it for in excess of 50,000 years. It is dated back more than 500,000,000 years and it presents today exactly as it did then. There are many sacred sites around the base of Uluru (formerly Ayers Rock) many of which are sacred and unable to be photographed. There were many international tourists there and you can see how popular it has become as an icon of the ''Red Centre'' and Aussie outback. We did an 18 hour coach tour from Alice Springs with ''Emu Run Experience'' tours who really ensured that you never missed a thing there and back. We even had a champagne BBQ as we watched the sunset colours of the rock. Whether you do the long trip or stay overnight this is a must see if you are holidaying in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Every Australian must visit this place once in a lifetime. It's huge! We couldn't do the climb due to high winds but we did the 10.5km base walk. You get to see the Rock from so many different angles. Take plenty of water.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A truely wonderful experience..a must see..waited a long time to go and it was so worth the wait...do not miss
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I found the climb very scary in parts but definitely worth the magic once on top.i cannot believe the climb is legal due to the slippery surfaces and sheer cliff tops
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"From wherever you get to view Uluru.(Ayers Rock) it is a spectacular sight. The walk to the top is very popular but of course most people now know that it will cease to exist in October 2019. It is a sacred sight to the Aboriginal people and they have now declared it to be forbidden to climb. It has been a long time ambition of mine to climb it and whilst I respect and understand the decision to close it, I did do the climb because the Aboriginal Elders accepted that many people had made plans to do it and they are keeping it open to enable those people to tick it off their list and to not disappoint them. I thank them for that."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Walking along the base of Uluru before sunset was an incredible experience. The colors are spectacular. Viewing it at sunset is also wonderful.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,First AATKings tour was just great Dylan one of the best guides we have had...what a book of knowledge and very entertaining.. and Malcolm our happy bus driver. The walk is long around 4 hours so dress casual.sun oil and a hat..the breakfast served is enough to kill any hunger.excellent set up with seats half way...You can pull out here and complete the full walk as we did and visit the cultural centre instead as we did..Malcolm will drop you and pick you up..this is so worthwhile with real artists painting..video shows on the heritage.. we spent over an hour an loved it a great insight into the culture.. All in all a great investment ENJOY Karl and Emma
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The climb is worth the effort if you can. Fantastic view from the top. Take your time, take water and good shoes."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Nothing prepares you for the majesty of Uluru. The only thing that really helps understand this sacred site is to see it from a very far distance and then get closer. The walk around is easy and magical, spoilt at times by large families hydrating their children and things on wheels with very strict guides making their group park in very neat rows - a bit bizarre. The incessant noise of helicopters flying the wealthy over the rock detracted from the magic of this ancient spiritual site of the Aboriginal people of Australia. We were shocked to see there were still people ignoring the note respectfully asking people not to clim the rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is the highlight of this trip. We had fun to explore that region. So different from the rest of Australia. I liked the info at every cave. The Aboriginals were skilled in painting. Some cave are filled with paintings. It was truly beautiful! Aboriginals are close with each other. They care! However, I enjoyed the sunset on Uluru. There were three buses together. They were working fervently on the food. Amazing, there were vegetarian food and it was so delicious. We were waiting to see the sunset on Uluru. Everybody had their camera. There were some Aboriginals who sold paintings. Everybody was happy. We talked while we ate. However, we didn’t stay until in was completely the sunset. Still, Uluru looked really red. Amazing! I will remember this experience. This was really worthwhile A must see!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My first time visit to Uluru was fantastic. The sights are incredible, varied and exciting. You're spoilt for choice with accommodation. Transport and tours are readily available and there's a variety of restaurants to choose from with delicious food. Make sure you book an event like the Sounds of Silence dinner under the stars. Unmissable!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"See it at Sunrise, see it at Sunset and see it in the middle of the day. Uluru is always changing color as the light of day alters. Very spiritual place, please be respectful and dont climb, instead do a guided walk and then continue the whole way around. It is a must see from every side"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is amazing at all times of day and is far more stunning than any photos or T.V. shows can capture. Kata Tjuta is underrated and was absolutely spectacular. Kings Canyon and West MacDonnell Ranges are also amazing to tour, so make sure you have time to take in all of the sites during your visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The rock is so big, looks real impressive . It is an easy walk around the rock about 11 km. Very interesting and so, so old."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Excellent value with thee day pass. Great drivers. Sunrise over Uluru and Kata Tjuta so more spectacular then I ever imagined.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes, it is definite must to see it at sunrise, sunset and from different vantage points. It is absolutely breathtaking to see it turn bright red. We did the base walk and it was relatively easy walk on a flat path and it allowed us to see it up close. We would recommend the bike ride as a faster way to get around. If you have time - do a day trip to Kings Canyon and do the Rim Walk as the hike rewarded us with more interesting views."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Just WOW!! my only critic is that we didnt give ourselves long enough to enjoy it!! If i was doing our again i would stay near there for a night and give yourself a full day to explore the National Park! You wont be disappointed!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I climbed Ayers Rock this week and was lucky enough for a cool day with a light breeze. It is much harder than I expected! Take a minimum of 2L water for sure and plenty of sunscreen and maybe a hat. The first half of the climb is with the chain to help and I highly suggest holding it even with one hand as you climb as the rock is very slippery, even with good grip trainers it is very easy to slip. The second half once you have reached the top of the chain is slightly easier, as it is more flat with just a few steep small slopes here and there. I wouldn’t suggest taking pictures as you walk. Stop for a drink or for a picture etc then continue walking, the ground is very uneven and it would be very easy to lose footing and fall. Another tip I was given luckily before I done the climb was when coming back down the chain, go backwards. This way if you lose your balance and footing you won’t be falling forward and rolling down the hill. Instead, you would just be falling upwards and remaining safe. Also on some of the sections a lot of people even just slide down on their bum to keep their balance and stop themselves falling forward. Be very careful of how close to the edge you go for your looking out and pictures, the wind can pick up very quickly. It’s tough, I’m not gonna lie. And I have at least a moderate level of fitness. But I completed both up and down in around 1hr 50ish. Just take lots of little breaks when needed and keep hydrated then go again. When you get to the top of the chain and realise it’s only half way, it defo makes it seem doubtful if you can make it all the way if you really struggled with first section, but it is easier! And the feeling of accomplishment is awesome when you reach the end 💕"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was my 4th visit to Uluru and it never fails to impress. The first time I visited Uluru was on a motorbike during the winter of 1959. The trip was not one for the faint-hearted. The road was unsealed and prudence was essential as was the ability to mend punctures on the run. Uluru itself was apparently deserted, there were no facilities and we rolled our swags out under the the magnificent canopy of the Milky Way never seeing another soul. Things have changed. The park is highly organised, entrance fees are charged and the traditional owners undestandably ask that visitors refrain from climbing this very sacred site. Climbing will be banned in the near future. I was fortunate enough to be one of the first people to use Peter Severin's wire rope climbing aid. Seeing trees growing out of the soil that had accumulated in some of the fissures on top of the world's largest monolith was an unforgettable experience. I am too old to do any more climbing and I respect the owners' wishes in any case. But seeing Uluru from a distance and walking around its base observing its legends remains an unforgettable experience for me."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Have just returned from this awesome flight .My wife and l had front row seats to view this magnificent spectacle .We flew with PHS and would highly recommended them as they were on time, friendly,informative and as their name suggests very professional As for reading some of the negative feedback from previous customers ,l find some of their critisms a bit off the mark, ie “we were only allowed to fly a certain distance from Uluru “ l am pretty sure all flight companies are only allowed to fly a certain distance from Uluru and KataTjuta.Granted we were fortunate to have front row seats which may have made this flight even more memorable but all the same l would highly recommend anyone to put this on their bucket list ! Trevor and Sue, GEELONG"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is the place to visit here in Australian Outback. It is located in a National Park. Entrance fee 25AUD that is valid for 3 days. You should visit during the day and return at sunset and sunrise. Very, very beautiful."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru was overwhelmingly beautiful. We did the base walk and I can definitely see why it holds a sacred place in the hearts of the traditional owners.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The first time I came to Ayres Rock was in the mid-1970s when there was no National Park, you barely saw an Aboriginal person, there was certainly no expensive tourist trap of a resort and I climbed The Rock, signing my name in the book at the top without feeling I was doing anything wrong. I returned 4 years ago. The Rock is just as beautiful but how the place had changed. This year I decided that, since they are banning climbing the Rock in October 2019, I thought I would like to see if my considerably older bones could make the climb. I got about two-thirds of the way up but I'm not as fit as I used to be. I did, however, make the Base Walk which, apart from the areas to the left and right of the climb area is, in fact, fairly boring and a bit of a waste of 3 hours. In hindsight, it would have been much better to have hired a bike from the Cultural Centre, as there are plenty of places with bike racks where they can be left while you look at the more interesting areas. The Aboriginal stories about the various parts of the Rock are interesting but there could be more about the actual geological history of the Rock and less of the stories if it is intended to be educational to all visitors. One popular new attraction is to take a Segway tour of the Rock; however, this is not so popular for those trying to walk on the same tracks! The Cultural Centre hasn't changed in the last four years but it is worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We live in Melbourne and decided to visit Ayers Rock for 4nights to tick it off our Bucket list and have a short break before our regular once a year International Trip splash. We were not disappointed with the MAJESTIC and AWE-INSPIRING sight of Ayers Rock, The Olgas, etc. The parks are well kept, clean and good signages everywhere. The Sunset, Sunrise and various observation points were great photo stops and we took hundreds of them. After all, this is once in a Lifetime trip and we don’t think we will ever return as the price that one pays to holiday here does not justify a repeat trip. It is actually quite “Disgusting” for Ayers Rock Resort to charge Australians and us Tax Payers Top Dollars to enjoy a National Treasure! They monopolise all the Hotels and don’t make an effort to improve their services. The Government should step in and allow Private enterprises esp Indigenous ones to provide more variety of offerings to Australians and Tourists alike. I would have given this a 5 Star otherwise."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru was a very enjoyable experience as it provided with a beautiful sunset dinner and an amazing view of the desert and the rest of the hill I would recommend you bring a ton of water and some snacks for the long journey up the hill. You will probably have to do it this year as next year it will definitely close as of how precious it is to the indigenous people and they don't want us ruining it.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Looking at this site is unimaginable..It is massive and just like the tour pictures. Climbing the rock or doing the walk tours are excellent.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Did the AAT sunrise tour. Early start and nice driver Macca. But it was really really cold. I would have appreciated warning when we booked. I had a woollen jacket but really needed a winter coat .
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"""Uluru"" was under my bucket list since 2015 and it literally gave me chills when I witnessed this massive humongous red rock which is certainly one of the preeminent wonder of nature. Its being said the best time to visit Northern Territory is between May-Aug,so I planned my long pending Outback trip this Aug end .The temperature was pretty decent during day time(18-25 degrees) but at night the temperature was around 3-6 degrees ,so would recommend to take warm clothes with you if you are planning to camp or sleeping under stars in swags during winter. Upon our arrival at Ayer's rock airport around 12:30 PM, we were picked up by our tour (Mulgas Adventure Tours) and reached Kata Tjuta National park in 35 mins (distance from Airport to National park is 30 kms).Post paying the entry fees for National park (25$ per person) ,we arrived the car park from where we started the Uluru base walk. The perimeter of Uluru base is approximately 10.6km ,it takes approximately 3.5 hours to complete. We reached the Kuniya car park around 3:30 PM ,since we had to witness the sun set (6:30 pm) so we started the base walk from Kuniya car park and finished at the car park near uluru climb, took us approximately 2 hours in total. There are couple of places as ""sensitive sites"" so photography is not allowed there.The use of drone is also prohibited at Uluru. In case if you don't want to get lost while base walking just make sure ""The rock is always on your right hand side"" so that it can be ensured you are moving in one direction. The base walk was absolutely mesmerizing ,the texture of the rock is different from various angles and also the color varies depending upon the Sun light.There are many aboriginals stories like Kuniya-Liru and Lungkata which are associated with the rock and the walks are named after them .There are several places on the rock which hold the significance to these stories and can be spotted while walking. The base walk is suitable for all age group,be in comfortable walking shoes ,wear hat/cap and shades.Would recommend to carry water. One toilet place is approximately 200 meters away from the carpark which is near the climb point (although the uluru climb was open ,we opted not to climb as its considered as the sacred place for aboriginals,so please dont climb and be respectful,also from Oct 2018 its going to be officially prohibited). This world heritage site is 500 million years old and can not be missed if you are planning to explore the rugged outback of Australia."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We loved our time staying in Yulara. Great time of year, temperature 20-35 degrees. Very windy at times. Free shuttle to transfer you around the resort. The rock itself is very impressive as it changes colour due to the sunlight, the walk around the base is a must do. Approx 10km and very little shade. We stayed 5 nights and only had one day of downtime. I cannot recommend enough the dot painting in the city center, it is taught by an indigenous woman and a greater understanding of their works and the meaning behind the symbols is learnt. Camel riding at sunset was our second favourite our host Uncle Steve provided ongoing entertainment as we strolled through the sand dunes. Lastly do not miss the field of light, it is larger than you can imagin and a truly magical experience. Food is expensive as a whole but the IGA in the town center is stocked full of goodies including hot pies."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Don’t know where to start, it’s better if you hire a car and do it at your own pace, try book your park pass on line $25 per person, make sure you do a sunset viewing and a sunrise viewing, you can climb it at the moment bit the aboriginals don’t like you doing it but from next year it will be definitely closed, make sure you wear comfortable shoes , take lots of water, there are amazing walks around the rock, the waterhole is a must to see"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This has to be one of the most amazing places on our earth. Sunset, sunrise Uluru does not disappoint photographers or spectators. The only fly in the ointment is that some bright spark has decided to float a huge white blimp around the rock at these times. It is probably OK if you go on windy days when the blimp can't fly. When it is up it takes up a considerable chunk of Uluru and certainly not something I want in my photos. Our sunset dinner was spoiled by this great white oddity blocking views. What a shame. It looks so out of character even where it is moored on the edge of town."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Must-See in Australia! The different views are spectacular in every daytime! Enjoy sunset and sunrise! Concentrate on the aborigine people and their way of life, it‘s different! Every cent worth!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We all think about going but a lot do not. Fortunately my Sister convinced us to go and I will never forget this quintessential Australian experience. By flying out or Brisbane it is a quick and simple trip into Coonellan airport and 10 mins later we are booking into The Lost Camel. All hotels here are run by Accor and what a wonderful job the do by providing 3 to 5 star accommodation, training for the youth of Australia (1200+ staff are working out here) and in conjunction with tour operators some of the most wonderful trips and dinner experiences. We joined into the Festival of Lights Dinner and this is World class. What an experience. An amazing part of all this infrastructure is that you still feel (and you are) that you are in a small country town with every convenience. All people we met are relaxed and happy and every where we went whether by tour or in the hire car, it was great to experience the Centre of Australia and all it has to offer. Even down to a very simple (and free) experience is to walk over to the Imalung lookout - all a 5 min walk from your accommodation - while still dark to see the stars give way to a dawn including Uluru views/colours, a 360 degree view, a young dingo pup who visited each morning and all the people from all over Australia and the World to experience this event together. From having a cuppa at dawn next to the rock or watching sunset from a viewing platform between Uluru and Kata Tjuta, driving down Lasseters Way to the Mt. Connor viewing platform or just simply seeing the small birds in the town square at dawn on the native bushes, this is a relaxing enjoyable event. Go on - experience - BUT - relax mate and enjoy it for what it is. AshandShell"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Pros: It was alot bigger than I imagined which was good. It's an Australian icon so was cool to see just for that reason. It is very beautiful. Climbing it was the best part! Those views were awesome. Cons: has very controlled paths and alot of rules which takes away from the excitement just because you're constantly worried you're doing something wrong. The base walk was probably my least favourite walk in the area (in saying that they were all pretty good I just think the Olga's and king's canyon were better)
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was my 2nd visit to this amazing and spiritual place, we stayed to watch sunset. Its always worth the long drives and rough roads (depending) where you are coming from."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A place that I have long wanted to journey to. Iconic. Beautiful. Powerful. Special. Awesome. All those words apply when you are there standing on country.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We had 5 days at the resort in Uluru staying at the Emu Walk apartments. The accommodation was excellent with plenty of eating places to choose from. There are plenty of tours and activities some of these are free. It gave a great insight into the aboriginal culture and gives you a respect for the skills needed to live in the traditional way. The scenery was magnificent especially if you take a trip to Kings Canyon available as a day trip. The trip was fun and educational -a great way to experience Central Australia.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this amazing place! We have been twice and have been inspired both times. We have done both the Mala and Kuniya walks, nice and level with plenty of wonderful things to see - both recommended."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our trip to Uluru was great, it offers many different walking trails around the Uluru that allow you to access different angles. The colors are amazing. Sunrise at Uluru was also a great experience - if you're up for an early wake-up."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My sister and i took my mum for her 89th birthday - nearly everything we did was accessible by wheelchair or those who low mobility. Whilst sunrise and sunsets are stunning, it is also important to understand Uluru from the indigenous people who own this land. Please don't climb it for starters! This is a sacred site! At the moment the Field of Light art installation can be seen at night. I would recommend the dune drinks and then walk through it tour, as it really needs to be seen from above to get the full affect. It is stunning."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After circumnavigating Uluru (Ayers Rock) the first day, the climb was closed due to high winds at the top, the second day the climbing track was open and a steady stream of people of all ages were ascending and descending. Due to the fine weather the surface of the rock was relatively dry so the climb whilst challenging, especially sections that have the chain , if you are fine with heights and have good aerobic fitness the climb with a few stops may take you about an hour up and slightly less time coming down depending on how many times you stop to take in the views or to catch your breath. Even after the chain section walking to the summit marker there are a few sections people may find a little challenging. Great views on the way up and whilst at the top you can use the summit marker to pick out landmarks in the distance. There are no toilet facilities or drinking water at the summit, so utilise the toilet facilities on the other side of the road opposite the Mala car park before heading up and also bring some drinking water and snacks. The Cultural Centre 2km (walk) from the Mala car park has toilet facilities, food and drink and rubbish bins. The National Park entry fee is $25 for a 3 (consecutive) day pass. If staying at Voyages resort if you don’t have your own transport and prefer a self guided trip you can pay for the hop on hop off bus with prices starting currently $49 for return trip with other options available for additional costs. The climb to the summit will close permanently on 26 October 2019"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great place, reach of sensations better in sunset with red and yellow colours. You need a ticket to go into the park. Respect of the area is a must."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I decided I couldn't truly say I'd lived in Australia without visiting the proper Outback. This experience was worth every single long, long, loooooong hour on the road to reach it. The area is beautiful and there's just another level of connection to the land. Take the time to learn the culture and listen to the stories and you will get so much more out of the park. You can visit the Cultural Centre (FREE) or take a guided Mala with one of the rangers (also FREE). Also, please respect the Aboriginal owners' wishes and not climb or photograph sacred areas (all very well sign posted). It is an honor to be able to visit this incredible place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"crowds of people walking around it, climbing it and paying to see it. Crowds of people everywhere - 6 full busloads of people and 100 cars crowded onto the sunrise viewing platform. So overrated its not funny."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"From a distance it looks massive, as you get closer it becomes small. The parking is nice and safe. There is a cultural centre to look at for a lot of valuable information. The accessibility on foot is great. People of any age will enjoy. The access the park it is $25 per person. Not cheap but it is worth it. There are many crowds at sunrise and sunset. Do go and visit....bring a camera."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Awesome place, almost doesnt look real. $25 per person to enter for 3 days. Its amazing. We went on a free tour in the morning was very informative and worth going on."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Breath taking, awe inspiring and moving. What an amazing place to visit. We did the base walk - long but worth it, various other walks and tours, and sunrise and sunset. Just amazing. A sight that will stay in my memory for ever. And don’t climb, it’s disrespectful."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This was an amazing day for all involved.. the men are the one's who climbed the rock.. they came back exhilarated but totally exhausted.. they said it was very scary.. the other two of us only went up about 30 metres which was enough.. overall it was a lifelong dream to actually stand on the rock and to see and feel it's ageless energy
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Totally lived up to all my expectations! If you have a car, suggest that you do sunrise and sunset yourself at the recommended locations and only pay for a separate field of light tour (which you can't do independently). Really enjoyed the base walk. And please support not climbing Uluru."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Went to both sunrise and sunset viewings. Totally breathtaking! If we would have had time, would have liked to do the walk around Ayers Rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great spot. Beautiful at sunset and sunrise. Nice walk around the rock, they’re closing the climb forever in 2019. Enjoyed my visit to this national park."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited a couple of times over 2 days and I found it best at sunset - the sunset viewing areas are well situated to catch the late afternoon light and the colours shift as the sun sets. The morning viewing platform is more to the south of the rock so the morning light only catches the end of the rock in Winter when we were there - given the huge numbers there at that time (and big crowds trying to get a photo from the viewing platform) I'd not bother with that again. Having said that, Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) really popped in the dawn light, even when seen from Uluru which is over 50 km away - much more impressive than Uluru itself. There is a ring road around the rock which is worth a drive and the Mutitjulu Waterhole was definitely worth a visit. There are some culturally sensitive areas around the base of the rock that the traditional owners ask not to be photographed and they are REALLY, REALLY not keen on people climbing the rock, and not just for safety reasons. A reasonable view of Uluru can also be had from the Yulara resort ( from a sand dune mound in the centre of the circular main road), but that is about 20 km away and outside the park boundary."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Having read reviews of the walk up Uluru, it is naive of writers to conclude that putting themselves and children in danger, and disrespecting the stated wishes of the owners, that The walk up the rock “is worth it”. I did the walk around it and found it was majestic, and most of the way we had the track to ourselves. Peaceful, and certainly gave us cause toreflect on traditional life there for thousands of year before us. The facilities at The resort are excellent. It’s not cheap, but one must remember the infrastructure there is almost totally for the visitors, and it’s a very remote place. All staff we met were friendly and very efficient. Kata Tjuta is excellent too. The walk around the valley of the winds is very difficult in places. Those with weak legs and dodgey knees need to seriously reconsider going! It is a great place to visit and to photograph."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Did not intend to be disrespectful to the Anangu people, but researched enough to learn that the reasons for disallowing tourists to climb it beginning Oct. 2019, are that there have been too many deaths and rescues, and that several individuals have done vile and sacrilegious things. I did none of that & actually prayed every step of the way. Rock was close in the morning due to high wind, so when it opened, I took the rickety bus by myself to the locations. Terrifying in the beginning because wind was still high. Very challenging, and that chain was absolutely necessary for me. Some places after the chain ended were sheer rockface. In spite of being scary, it was also exhilarating and overall a great sense of accomplishment! Glutes & arms a bit sore for a couple of days."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a nice rock 9/10 rock. I would like to become friends with Uluru, but Uluru likes no one - w/e. I love rocks."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Did the 12km sunrise walk around Uluru with Alex at SEIT tours and had an amazing time with my husband and daughter. Cold start -2c but warmed up and was an unforgettable experience. Highly recommend.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Clearly the highlight of every visit to the Red Centre. The rock was awesome. We did a trek to the Waterhole and car sunset viewing on the day of arrival by car rental from Alice Springs, and a sunrise viewing and trek to the Gorge. Seeing it for the first time was really captivating. We bought our park entry tickets online and scanned 1 of our passes for car entry bypassing the queues. Park entry passes are good for 3-5 days for the same price. Parking at the Mala car park was overcrowded and we were not sure what the enforcement of kerbside parking would be like, so that was the main downside."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visited this beautiful place. So forbidding but serene. Battled wind, rain & slippery slopes (all unseasonal) but worth the effort to view stunning scenery. A 50 minute drive from town centre mainly on made roads. Less well known than Uluru but definitely worth visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I finally had an opportunity to visit Uluru and didn't know what to expect apart from seeing a giant red rock. The first night I viewed the rock from a distance at sunset from the Field of Light viewing platform and witnessed the magnificent changing colours followed by seeing a sky full of stars. Nothing prepares you for seeing it up close. I travelled out to the rock by bus for the base walk. It was hard to find information with clear travel and entry details but I discovered there is a tour bus out from the resort(Uluru Hop on Hop Off , not the free resort shuttle which people assume would go there) with a few options such as one single return trip($49 pp) and importantly a parks Australia entry ticket must be obtained , not included in the bus fare. These are $25pp for three days access. I was able to purchase online and print in advance. (Phone storage okay too) The one day bus ticket will also take you to Kata Tjuta but it soon became apparent that Kata Tjuta could not really be fitted into one day and not every departure goes to both places. The rock is about 20 kms away from the resort and Kata Tjuta about 50 so unless you have a car the only option is the tour bus. The hop on hop off bus requires a pick up time choice on booking , and they ask you to nominate which return bus you will be on at departure.- hard when you have no idea what is out there. There needs to be more frequent runs as the hop on hop off concept was not working with many people wanting to return at the same time and no room and if you miss the bus there is a very long 1.5 hr wait for the next. This is also a problem at the base drop points for people who don't want to walk all the way. The bus drops people at several stops around the base which enables choice of how far you will walk if you do not want to do the entire base, or if you don't walk at all but just see it at one stop. I walked the section between Kuniya Piti to Kantju Gorge /Mala carpark and then the Liru walk to the cultural centre and picked up the bus back from there. There are some maps of the walks with distances online or parks Australia website. This section seems to have the most to see and allows you to be right at the rock. Part of the walk in other sections has the path further away from the rock. My perception of the rock changed as soon as I got off the bus and approached the walk. It is impossible to describe the beauty and intensity of the colours and the majesty of the rock. I had no idea of the vegetation around the base and the presence of caves, waterholes and formations by erosion. It was easy walk around the flat base although it is sandy so some sore muscles the next day. We passed several families pushing bikes as they could not ride easily in parts. Wear sunscreen and take water as there is several kilometres between places to obtain water and there are some toilets in one or two carparks and a cafe at the cultural centre(which is two kms away)In July temperatures varied from 2c to 22c so depending on time of day you make need a warm jacket. The rock climb will be closed soon and after learning how this has contributed to the pollution and damage to the previously pristine waterholes and environment around the rock it can't happen too soon. Several weeks after the experience I am still feeling in awe. This is one of my top memorable experiences."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We walked the base of the rock. A fine quiet stroll along this impressive giant. See the marks of wind and water. Look at the places the ancestors from the dreamtime created the world and the people passed on their stories. It humbled and lifted me. A great way to spend a couple of hours.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"With the pending ban on climbing (people have the right to enjoy the natural world unfettered by race, religion or politics) I set off with my two daughters to have a chance of enjoying some of the world's best desert views before ignorance and superstition take them away next year. Everything about the trip was over priced, from the flights, Park entry, accommodation and meals. Don't expect the standards to reflect the price you will pay. The level of intrusion of Park regulations, warning signs, threats to fine you for the flimsiest reasons, no parking zones, no stopping zones, no photography etc etc has become extreme and detracts significantly from the experience. The circuit walk which is remote from the actual rock along the northern boundary has signs every 100 m but its clear from photos on the internet that no one pays any attention to them. The views are also available in quite a number of books and make a mockery of the photographic rules. In the 1980s the park was much more open with tourist access to all sites except for the Mens Initiation cave Warayuki. This was with approval of the Traditional Owners. The reputation of the park was gained from this era but since Parks Australia and Board have gained control the experience is has been very much diminished, managed and controlled. Of course those visiting for the first time are none the wiser that past visitors enjoyed a much much better deal. One of the sad things was to see access to the KataTjuta Lookout in the Olgas closed. This has some of the best views anywhere in Australia. Management of the climb has been a complete debacle since the early 2000s. We were lucky to find the gate open two of the three times we attempted to go up, and managed to climb twice. On the third occasion winds were claimed to be an issue, yet as Parks do not have an anemometer to correctly determine wind speeds at the summit...rangers just guess. It appeared no different to the other days when it was open. The climb itself remains a wonderful experience and made our trip worth while. Those who do not climb will not know that they are missing out on one the world's most iconic walks. The physical nature of the climb, the views on the way and from the summit, the natural features on the summit and surrounding geomorphology are breathtaking. The second time we climbed a grass fire was burning in the distance casting a plume of smoke across the horizon. Hopefully the Park and the Board reverse their decision to ban the climb and provide more opportunities for people to climb by relaxing some of the overly conservative closure protocols. Without the climb its simply not worth your while. Suggest looking at a tour on the Larapinta Trail instead."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru at sunset and sunrise as part of a trip organised by Sandrifter Safaris. The views were spectacular, and the changing colours of the rock stunning."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visiting and climbing Uluru (or Ayres Rock as it used to be known) has been on my bucket list for many years. However those who manage the site feel they should ban people from climbing and will do so from the 26th October 2019. So I made sure I booked in the family to go there while we still could. As flights there and accommodation are so expensive you want to make sure you make the most of your visit. (for comparison I booked the family for a holiday in Japan for less than it was for our trip from Sydney to Uluru). Seeing sunrise and sunset on the rock in the National Park was beautiful, and the personal highlight was being able to climb the rock and look out across the desert across to Kata Tjuta (formerly The Olgas). The risk when you visit is that there are days when the rock is closed to climbers due to the weather, winds, or other cultural reasons. Of the four days we were there, it was only open for climbing one day. If cannot or choose not to climb the walk around the base of the rock is amazing to see the lesser known aspects of the rock -the pools of water, the caves, the rock art, and the varying shapes and textures. The drive out to Kata Tjuta is worth doing for another series of walks. The nearly cultural centre has some interesting displays and the slowest cafe I have ever encountered -so make sure you have plenty of time if you plan to buy a drink or have lunch there."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was worried that Uluru couldn’t possibly live up to the high expectations but it did, with ease. It has so many amazing different aspects to see up close and the changing colours at sunset are just wonderful."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A stunning natural feature. Hugely impressed by the environment and facilities. Did the base walk, Cultural Centre, and both sunrise/sunset sites"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Went as part of a work conference. I didn’t expect to fall in love with this place but I did. We were lead around some of the base by a geologist named Barry from AA Kings and went back for sunrise. As an Australian I can’t believe it has taken me nearly 40 years to get to the second largest rock in the world. The red earth and the spinifex grass in the morning light is beautiful. I watched from the path instead of the platform to avoid the crowd and enjoy the serenity.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,How to describe the beauty and majesty of this sacred place? I didn’t realise how vast this Unesco World Heritage Site is until I was up close and personal. The colours and changing light is something you will never forget. Just get there!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I am so happy I talked my husband into venturing into the Outback with me to see Uluru. It was my favorite part of our trip to Australia. I definitely recommend getting a guided tour so you can learn the history and even watch the sunrise. It's just so beautiful out there in the middle of nowhere and brings a sense of peace and calm. Worth it!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Visiting Uluru is an opportunity to contact with your self and listen to local stories Watch the sunset and a sky full of stars
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The rock is huge, changes in the light, can be majestic at distance and overwhelming up close. That's the simple bit, and enough wonder to make it awesome... It's formation is ancient and complex. It's place in politics are complex. It's cultural significance is complex... Snippets are explained on the many interpretation boards.. A source of permanent water in an arid land, cool gorges, birdlife, and signs of human habitation in caves and rock overhangs.. a testament to skill and tenacity of being human. It may move you in unexpected ways, or be an icon ticked off a bucket list. But you have to be there to feel it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"an amazing place the size of the rock takes your breath away, some fantastic walks to be done around the base of the rock. access and parking is easy and the cultural centre is fantastic we had brunch at the café before starting out and the food and service was great"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ok, it’s not cheap to get to Uluru Kata-Tjuta but it’s worth every penny. One of the most stunning locations I’ve ever seen. We watched the sunset and sunrise at Uluru when we were there. Do go to the less famous ‘Olgas’ (Kata-Tjuta) which has some great walks into gorges and incredible scenery of its own. A couple of tips for the park - the food in the cultural center at Uluru is great value compared to the hotels in nearby Yalara where all the accommodation is located. Have lunch here, but note they do stop serving at 2.30pm. After that preprepared sandwiches are available. Second, there are excellent free Mala Walks with park rangers at 10am in Winter or 8am in Summer. The walk is not too strenuous and pretty flat, and you will get a decent basic understanding of the significance of Uluru. Our ranger was excellent. You’ll see some Anangu art in caves and a water hole. Some sensitive areas are passed where you are asked not to photograph. We respected the wishes of the Anangu and didn’t climb the mountain. Uluru is more than just a rock, it is a living cultural landscape that of which is considered sacred to the Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara people."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This really is something that you must see while in Australia. The trip is definitely worth it. Ayers Rock is beautiful and watching the sunset over it is a must do experience while there. They sky turns purple. We did the sunset tour and we also did the base walk. The base walk is 6 miles around, but it is worth it. The rock really is mesmerizing. Just be aware that there are no bathrooms along the six mile walk, so that can be annoying. We went in the winter and it was perfect weather, I am not sure that I would do the walk in the summer, it feels like it could be pretty miserable at that time of year."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We drive here for a self guided tour and were not disappointed. We cycled the base in the morning and ventured back to catch the sunset and even got a birds eye view from a helicopter and it never ceased to amaze and move me. Surprisingly I opted out of the climb - despite my initial intentions to do exactly that - watching all those ‘ants’ clamber up the side seemed .... I’m not sure of the right word - I don’t want to say wrong because each to their own, but it just didn’t seem ‘right’ that and it’s not an easy climb so why ruin the experience with burning muscles, sunburn and heat fatigue."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Although slow getting into the park, it was worth it. Both Uluru and Kata Tjuta are marvellous. The sunset was great. Very busy in July"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Just visit...should be on everyone's bucket list! Maybe avoid school holidays if possible! Loved it!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I took the hop on/hop off bus that delivered me to Uluru and back to my hotel. It was $50 for the day. I started with my first drop off at the Mala Walk. I would highly suggest this area. Go through the parking lot towards the rock and head left (ignore the super rude people climbing the rock and doing so right next to the signs that ask you to respect the Aboriginis by not doing so). Once you head left, you'll wander through a trail and find yourself in two different areas that have Aboriginal art. They were beautiful and the platforms take you right up to them. Please also note that there are signs along the trail asking visitors not to take pictures in certain areas because they are considered holy. I then got back on the bus and rode to the Cultural Center to walk around and see their museum - it was worth it. They also have shops and a place where you can buy paintings done by some locals (I got a small one for $60AUS). I took the last bus back, not realizing our driver, ""Snakebite"" as he called himself lol, was actually going to stop for us to watch the sunset at no extra cost. People were paying lots of money for sunset tours and we got to do it as part of our ride home! It's def an extra cost to fly out to Uluru and stay there, but it was worth every penny."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So much is written about Uluru, and so many photos taken.... so instead I thought to focus on the big discussion point with my family of teenage kids - whether or not to climb Uluru. The argument will be moot after October 2019 when the rock is closed off. But that, combined with a reluctance by the current custodians and National Parks to open up the climb (it was open for only 3 hours in the 3 days we were there), means there is a huge pent up demand to climb. When it does open, it's chaos. I was more dubious about the arguments against climbing Uluru until I visited the Cultural Centre and also walked around the rock. I came to appreciate the significance of Uluru to the local indigenous people, including the role Uluru has had in preserving and protecting their people. Dreamtime stories, used to covey key values and beliefs, are told using the features of Uluru. I came to the conclusion that climbing Uluru was equivalent to abseiling down St Paul Cathedral in Melbourne, so decided it was not for me. Hearing of a poor +70 year old tourist dieing from a heart attack climbing Uluru earlier in the week also helped focus my thinking. In the end, all 4 of my teenage kids climbed Uluru, while my wife and I waiting nervously at the bottom (not all 37 climbing deaths are heart attacks, many are also falls, including at least one child). Our kids described the ascent as ""hard work"", view at the top as ""spectacular"", and the descent as ""terrifying"". They also described the chaos around the guide chains, the log jams at the steepest inclines, and the spectacle of parents literally dragging young children up the rock, tethered and screaming. In the balance, I'm glad I didn't climb, but each to their own...."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I think every Australian should visit here. You see it on postcards & travel magazines.But it is not until you see the size of the place you don't appreciate how beautiful it is. For all those foreign tourists, it is well worth coming to Australia to see it. Even tough it is a long drive from any major city it is well worth it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru in Winter and yes the mornings and evenings are cold but the days are just perfect. A good time of year to visit as there are no flies. From the minute I saw Uluru from the plane I was mesmerised by its presence. You cannot take your eyes off of her. She is grand, she is magnificent and she is captivating. It is hard to describe the feeling you get when you visit here. As others have pointed out buy your park pass beforehand as the line is a lot less shorter. Sunrise is amazing but in my opinion sunset is a lot more spectacular, colour wise. I highly recommend hiring bikes to see the base of Uluru especially if you have children. Fifteen kilometres is a long walk! Visiting Uluru can be expensive but if you are organised and your dates are flexible you can find some really reasonable flights. You can also stay at the camp site which does have cabins if you do not have a camper trailer. Once you pay for the park pass ($65 for a family for 3 days) you don't have to pay a cent. We brought our own picnic and there were lots of places to sit and eat. I highly recommend having lunch at the sunrise spot. Lunch with a view! Until October 2019 you can climb the rock but be warned it is not open all the time. They do shut it if the temperature reaches 36 degrees Celsius or if it is windy or raining. On the afternoons we were there it was open from 3pm-5pm. I was actually quite surprised how many people walked to the top. I really hope I get the opportunity in the future to visit Uluru again."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We rode around Uluru, walked the shorter walks, saw the sunrise and two sunsets and I could still go back and see it again."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We walked the entire base of the rock. It’s was a straightforward walk but riding the bikes may be a better option. I thought the walk thru the Kata Djuta (the Olga’s) was even better. Note that climbing the rock will stop in 2019 and it’s strongly recommended not to by the local owners.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Rock is awesome. We did climb it and it was a fantastic. Would recommend the climb, but have some fitness. Our disappointment is with the rangers. They are not friendly, overall and rude. The Aboriginals were more friendly. They are not doing the rock any favours by being there. Maybe they should just leave it to the Aboriginals to run and it would be a better experience. We would have liked to see more info about the rock itself, as it is amazing. We had to ""google"" the info we wanted. How old is it?What type of rock is it? etc,etc. We can't believe that this rock is 550 million years old.It was here way before any humans.The view from the top is spectacular!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We paid $250 for the sounds of silence dinner and we were a group of 4 who enjoy their food and wine and were looking forward to this experience. Unfortunatley Robert who was the young person hosting the venue, had very little experience in the respensible service of drinks and when we asked for a glass of white and red wine as we were having different foods with each - he banned our whole table - not just our group of 4 - he publicly humilated us in front of other patrons by annoucing this at the top of his voice (no discretion). To add insult to injury it is advertised as all you can drink and eat. Plus beaware that you should never go on a full mooon (as we did), plus the clouds stopped us for the star gazing tour by the astromertor. Overall this was the worst attraction i had been too in all my 60 years around the world. Robert - the inexperienced host, ruined our evening."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Uluru Kata Tjuta National park visit will remain etched in my memory for the new landscapes and the mind blowing pictures taken in multitude of hues depending on the position of the Sun, a whole new world of creatures and plants native to the area. Entry to the park is 25 dollar per person and the ticket is valid for 3 days with multiple entries. The ticket gives one access to both Uluru and Kata Tjuta rocks, the several view points, Cultural centre and many walking trails. There is a free guided morning walking trail at 10 am at Urluru. Vehicle is mandatory for visiting the parks if you want to spend time on your own. Recommend spending one full day at Uluru and one at Kata Tjuta. The sunsets are spectacular. You could stay at one if the hotels in the nearby Ayers Rock Resort. Park is open from 5.30 am/6.30 am in the morning till upto 7.30 pm or upto 9 pm depending on the month/season"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited the rock 3 times in the hopes of climbing it, but alas it was not to be. We drove around it, walked round it, had breakfast and lunch around it, and admired its awesomeness from afar to very close. It is truely very spectacular and eerie."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well signed & look after park all around. Yes you need a Park pass to go in to the park our hot tip is BUY IT ON LINE before entering the park, that way you can skip the que that happens during peak season. Also during peak season get to the park early- before 9:30 that way you can also skip the line to get in. Well worth the visit it AMAZING!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you are an international visitor, I'm not sure that is a ""must do."" It's big, it's great to walk around, but man is it expensive to get to and stay here. Having spent time in the American Southwest I was not overly wowed by the rock. Do make sure to get up close and walk around it - that is the best. Sunset views are fine - but not as awe inspiring as everyone makes them out to be."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Went to Ayers Rock on my own, 2nd time travelling by myself and I wasn’t sure in the first place, but it’s really a great experience, despite the hot weather ... unfortunately I only stayed for 2 nights, would love to do sky diving next time! Arrived around noon, joined the tour operated by AAT Kings, which was perfect for a chill afternoon, after a bus tour around the rock, went for a stroll at one of the secret spot, finished the tour with a glass of bubble at the viewing deck, best place for a sunset view"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"From the moment I saw Uluru I was excited. We spent 8 hours there the first day. Once you’ve paid you park fee 1-3 pass $25 per adult $65 per family, you can have hours in entertainment and education and you can come and go when we you like. Entry to the park closes at 7pm but you can stay in there for ages and enjoy the stars. The rock has so much to offer. Around every corner it has something new to show you. It is an easy walk around the rock 12.6kms in bush paths. You don’t need to spend a cent once your in the park. We stayed and witnessed sunset. Go early to the car park to get you spot. Take drinks and eats and enjoy. Sunrise was just as spectacular the next morning and it wasn’t that early. 7.36 sunrise. Then went to walk the valley of the winds walk at the Olga’s I loved every minute."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Amazing huge rock on the middle of nowhere but worth the trip. Really enjoyed the sunset and sunrise.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My husband and I have just had the best holiday staying at The Sails Resort Uluru Really delicious meals The Staff were so kind and helpful We also thoroughly recommend AATKing travel for all of your tours Always on time with fantastic drivers ( whom also make wonderful guides) &guides Special Thanks to Ivor the driver & Garry the guide ,Steve&Dillon for their Wisdom ,Passion & Knowledge but most of all for the respect they have for the Anangu people & land .The Sounds Of Silence Dinner is a must do well worth the money ."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We climbed the rock, did the Sunset view and got there again for sunrise ... totally different experiences but absolutely amazing"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We drove ourselves with our hire car from Alice! It was s very busy time with the grey nomads and school holidays! Parking was a bit creative! But we did our own Mala walk good signs! Easy flat walking !! We also did the waterhole walk signs seem to be missing that side of the rock! We dropped into the info centre too good to see some local information & Dreamtime stories! We did a 10 min helicopter ride from the resort totally recommend that!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It whispers to you reminding you that you are simply a speck, an entity that is one of many who has passed it by. It's difficult to describe an encounter with the rock... it's almost spiritual. It's passed the test of time and watched as people have come and gone, as the wind rustles, the ground shakes, the birds pass by, as animals hunt one another.. and it possesses memories that would daunt us. We can label it with our Scientific explanations but I believe that only the aboriginals truly understand as it's guardian what this rock is all about. The Anangu people believe that this landscape was created at the beginning of time by the travels of great ancestral beings. This is an experience like no other."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I underestimated the size and significance of this landmark. We hired bikes and rode around which is a great way of getting up close to the rock and the sights on the way around the base. I also recommend seeing sunset from a distance and there are various ways of doing that.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It’s a bucket list sight to see. Try to spend time and watch the colors and shadows change. Walk or jog around if you have time.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Experienced the colour changes at both sunset and sunrise. Camera doesn't do justice to the many hues. Drove around the monolith - just HUGE.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,To see Uluru especially at sunset is an amazing experience.The colours of the rock change as the sun light goes down. It is an awesome place to visit and I feel this place should be one of wonders of this world. Every one should put on this place on their bucket list.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went in the Aussie summer (only opportunity) so it was beyond murderously hot. The tour bus guide was very good, informative and constantly refilling our water bottles. Driver good too. So very many flies! Whatever you do take fly nets for your head and litres of repellent. I guess we expected something a bit less restricted and less touristy. Also we were very disappointed by the hotel. Maybe that was our mistake but we would never go again. If you feel that you just have to see Uluru then go in the winter months and two nights stay is enough."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Initially I just went to Uluru as part of my Australia trip because I thought I must not miss it. However, soon after I arrived I was completely blown away by the beauty of the place and was very glad I came. The following aspects might be helpful for future visitors: If you do not have a private tour via your hotel, the bus tours are actually pretty good. Normally I avoid bus groups but the one I took with King tours was not crowded at all and we had a very good guide. Whatever you do, ensure you take enough water with you. Speaking of water, if you come at the right time of the year, you might be lucky enough to see Uluru with remains of rain. I had this privilege and it was fantastic. There is quite some lively night life. If not at your hotel, you might want to go to another one in the evening (e.g. one of the lodges) where it is easy to meet people."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The national park is a world class site and visiting both Uluru and the adjacent Kata Tjuta, (remember, you may come to see Uluru aka Ayers Rock but the national park is really comprised on the two rock formations, Uluru and Kata Tjuta). Do understand that both sites are several kilometers away from the resort where everyone stays. Getting to the park is not easy since you must either take a tour or rent a car. I am traveling with three adults and fiscally, renting a car was the least expensive option with the benefit that we got to control our own visit. You can pay to ride the Hop on, Hop Off bus instead of a tour but even this option cost more than renting a car if there are three of you."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is something I have wanted to see since the first time I heard of it. It did not disappoint! We visited Uluru as we traveled from Darwin to Adelaide in a camper. We rented bikes and rode completely around Uluru, stopping frequently to walk in on trails, take pictures, or just enjoy the greatness of this rock. DO NOT MISS THIS IF YOU GET THERE."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So much to see and do there. Walk around the bottom is fabulous. Lots of little spots to stop and look and appreciate. The sunset is definitely my favourite. The colours really do change quickly. We took n6 photos - one every 5 minutes and it's one of those pleasures looking back at them. An NT holiday is a must do as far as travel in Australia is concerned, so if you haven't been there - GO!!!!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Our trip to the 'Red Centre' had been on the to do list for a long time. None of the photos you see prepare you for the size and the impact Uluru and Kata Tjuta have on the flat landscape around them. The cultural centre is very good and we enjoyed learning about the spiritual significance Uluru holds for the Aboriginal people. We thoroughly enjoyed the walks and the sunset. Hope to return one day.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You can get a 3 day pass for $25 per person for Uluru and Kata Tjuta Can easily spend a day walking around the 12km base walk, seeing the info centres or taking a helicopter, segway or bike around the area. Recommend seeing the rock change it's colours at a sunrise or sunset area. So wonderful."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is really worth starting a walk around the rock by joining the 10am ranger guided Mala walk which starts at the Mala car park. It’s a great introduction to the significance of the rock to its Indigenous custodians. This knowledge makes it much easier to respect the no photo zones (certain parts of the rock are off limits for photography because of their significance to the Anangu people). The route is absolutely flat but can be sandy in places. As well as pedestrians you will encounter cyclists (bikes can be hired from the Cultural Centre for $50 for 3 hours) and Segway tours. There are water tanks at a couple of the car parks along the route but it’s a good idea to carry some with you. The path doesn’t hug the rock all the way round so the view constantly changes. There are some caves with rock paintings and a couple of waterholes to visit. The Cultural Centre has a cafe and well stocked gift shop that includes practical items including sunscreen and insect repellant. This is a long (10km) but easy walk that is well worth the effort. As well as going to the sunset viewing area to watch the rock glow as the sun went down, we also enjoyed the event at the Mala car park which was just as spectacular in close up."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was my fourth visit to this stunning, ancient, spiritual landscape and I never tire of looking at the Rock and beautiful surrounds. Its awe inspiring scenery."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For the Aussie traveler, this is something to do on your list at least once in your life. The colours during sunrise and sunset are amazing. It is pretty hot during the day so take plenty of water with you!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Do your self a favour and visit this place at least once in your life. Drive there - the journey is all part of it.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My initial feeling before arriving was 'Well OK, it's a big rock'. But on seeing Uluru it is spectacular. We saw it at sunrise and sunset in June. To be honest we never saw the amazing colours you see in professional photographs. But don't be put off. It is well worth seeing."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Make sure you try and do the sunrise and sunset viewings they are well worth getting up early for. You can then walk around the rock before the heat gets too high. We did the free guided talk with one of the park rangers. It was very informative and gave us a good insight into the traditions of the indigenous people. He was very passionate about the subject and was happy to answer any questions we had. He also advised us on how and where to carry on our walk around the rock which was very helpful. The heat is very powerful so make sure you take plenty of water, sunscreen and cover up! We bought fly nets to go over our hats at the airport and were delighted we had when we got there. There are lots of small flies and they aim for your eyes, ears and mouths if you haven’t got a net hat. Most of the shops in the resorts sell them too."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru was an absolutely awesome and spiritual experience. Highly recommend both the dawn viewing and Fields of light
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It’s a great spot for a holiday camping ground set out really nice. Lots of easy walks to do around Yulara and also Uluru and the Olga’s we did a AAT afternoon tour to the Olga’s. It’s was excellent commentary was great. Our guide “Pacca” made it an enjoyable learning experience as well Put Ulura on you bucket list There is also a well stocked IGA supermarket there.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It was a wonderful and upliftting experience. Sunset and sunrise a must to experience as is other things to experience. A 3 to 4 day visit is required. I think the desert feeling and quiet in the outback is a great experience. Small little village. One can hire a car to get around. There are shuttles too. 3 hour flight from Sydney.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I recommend to visit Uluru during winter. The temperature is moderate and there are very few flies. This is a place with a lot of historical, archaeological, anthropological, and geological value and this is the reason why Uluru is a UNESCO site. The place is magical and I really believe that is a place that you have to explore on your own. You need to be free. You have to listen the nature and see how the colours change over time. Just rent a car and explore it. It is very easy and gloriously unbelievable. You should spent at least 2 days. See the sunset, walk around the base, explore the different paths. Independent tourist can see the sunset from a large area, not too crowded to which is quite easy to arrive. It is better that the sunset area for tour groups which is very crowded and more distant from Uluru."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Before the base walk around Uluru I did not really know what to expect - it seemed a bit like ""walking around a mountain with some information"". But there was much more: Our tour guide Garry (AAT Kings) had plenty of cultural as well as geological knowledge to provide interested tourists like me. Even the walk itself was fabulous so we talked about much more than just ""touristic stuff"". AAT Kings offers a lot of interesting tours, therefore it was a great week at Ayers Rock. Furthermore it was a pleasure to have Garry as a tour guide. Wish you all the best! Benjamin"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I Suggest start by reading the interesting information in the cultural centre. The Free Mala Tour - 1 1/2 hours - is also very informative showing and explaining things that ordinarily you would just walk past. The base walk - 10km - gives you an understanding of the vastness of the outcrop of Uluru. The highlight though is seeing it under the light of sunrise and sunset to truly appreciate its beauty.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It was actually surreal to visit this world famous landmark and its amazing changing colours. Visit at sunrise and sunset. So beautiful with memories to last a lifetime. You can even get a helicopter flight over it
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru's reputation as an iconic Australian destination is well deserved. We took the base walk, about 10.5 kilometres around the base of the rock, with access to gorges, caves and Aboriginal rock art. The walk is flat on a well maintained track, There is water available about half way along the walk, but it is advisable to take a couple of litres per person anyway. The changing shapes and colours of the rock give you some indication of why this place is sacred to Australia's indigenous people. We didn't climb the rock out of respect for the traditional owners, although on some days at least you are able to climb to the top. This is a place where you can enjoy spectacular scenery, and understand the connection Aboriginal people have to this place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My husband and I were on a guided tour of Australia and we stayed one night in the area. We had an attempt at sunset for a view, but the clouds covered the sunset, so that was a bust. But we did get a good group photo here. The next morning, we had a high along part of the rock. that one thing off my bucket list!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,From the moment to land and you see Uluru in the distance to the moment you drive close to the base it is impressive! For sure one of the most amazing sights we visited!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You just can't beat how amazing this place is. It has a great mix of culture and good exercise; be prepared for a walk. There are many flies, so be ready for that. However, it was great to see a place you grow up hearing about. Take lots of water!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's kind of like the grand canyon...""yep there it is."" You look at it, you drive around it and maybe hike near it but that is all. You only need a couple of days to see everything but it is worth the time, effort and money."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Such a quiet, peaceful place to visit, so close to home. People should experience this place before heading overseas."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A must see as an Australian icon. Extraordinary formation and in the right light conditions spectacularly colorful. We took an SEIT sunrise tour and due to the time of year or atmospheric conditions the colors left much to be desired. Not the tour company’s fault. The tour continued with a lot of information on aboriginal culture, paintings on the rock, and a full circumnavigation of the rock. The up close ruggedness and detail is quite interesting compared to the more common distant views. Had I not recently suffered a hip injury, I probably would have planned to make the climb to the top. But when our guide explained the current environmental impact of human waste and heavy metal waste from camera batteries, we fully support the decision to close off climbing by October 2019."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We travelled with Seit Outback Australia Tours for a sunrise and canyon walk. Arriving at the sand dune lookout at 7.00am, it was still dark and very cold however the sun rising over Uluru was spectacular. As the sun come over the horizon we got glimpses of lovely colour on Kata Tjuta. After this we travelled to a picnic area at the base of Walpa Gorge and had breakfast. We then walked into the canyon to marvel at the formation of Kata Tjuta and see how great boulders have been forced out of the giant cliffs and rolled down to the bottom leaving large cave like holes in the face of the cliffs. Sophie Radalj our guide and driver gave us all a very comprehensive overview of the geological history of the area as well as telling us about the plants and animals of this area. We have used Seit for other tours and would highly recommend them for those who want a more intimate style of tour. Well Done."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru & the Olga’s from above was spectacular. We used Ayres Rock Helicopter and our female pilot was great. The base walk of the rock really makes you realise how huge it is. We saw plenty of wildlife along the way, including reptiles such as the Western Brown and lots of gorgeous little dragons. Sunrise and sunset can not be missed. We were fortunate enough to catch the full moon rising right beside the rock which was so special. If you’re into photography this National Park is a dream. You will love it. Don’t forget the Olga’s they are fascinating and you can’t see Uluru without a hike and sunset there!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Its so worth seeing the rock at sunrise and sunset, its so beautiful. Also make sure you do the base work which is around 11k - but do it early in the morning so its nice and cool. This rock is so amazing, and I'm so happy that I've finally got to see it!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A brilliant natural wonder. Very awed. Great signage, info, roads. Toilets and water in a few places. Even the odd scrap of internet. You can drive the base or walk it (10k). There are a couple of excellent shorter walks. Great paths Please don’t climb Uluru!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wonderful relaxing holiday. Stayed at Sails in the Desert hotel which was excellent. Did several tours - sunrise and sunset over Uluru, marvellous."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Difficult to describe this legendary monolith, as there are so many views of it, features of it and stories surrounding the rock. The base walk is very worthwhile and not very difficult."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I've heard that by 2019, no-one will be allowed to climb ""the rock"". It's on the bucket list, so decided to visit the Red centre and tick off the activity. One of the best things I have ever done. It goes to show what a vast and magnificent country we live in."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The park is so big so that you can still escape people as otherwise any non extrovert would hate it. Go hiking, esp the base walk and you will see the rock alone a lot of the time and in all sorts of light. Wonderful. Sunrise and sunsets are rarely as spectacular as the brochure photos and you will watch them with massive crowds all hoping for something remarkable. And beware the POLICE sting operating here - revenue raising at its worst. Each day we found them sitting at the base of slopes, before sunrise and after, just inside the 60kmh zones after you've been used to driving at 80kmh while entering the park. We saw them clean up nabbing drivers doing only a little over the limit. The conditions here are not dangerous and I never saw an accident, so who knows what the police were trying to save us from ..... maybe just making a few thousand dollars an hour for the government. Disgraceful."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Most people know of Uluru, both locals and overseas visitors. Yes, it is astounding, the chameleon parade of colours, the different aspects and vistas, being up close, watching from the distance. Moe astounding again is Kata Tjuta, formerly the Olgas: the interplay of the rocks with the light at different times of the day to me, both as tourist and amateur artist, was even more astounding than at Uluru, but I wouldn't have missed either location nor ascribe a value: both were astounding!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Beautiful sight. Recommend only see it during sunrise and sunset and use midday for other tours and activities.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Such an amazing place to visit. Going in the cooler month made our trip very comfortable. Not too many tourists around. Such an iconic place to bris it, with amazing culture and history. We loved it!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The rock is an amazing natural phenomenon and is something everyone should see. The amount of different colours that the rock appears throughout a 24 hour cycle is amazing.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,An amazing place with spectacular scenery and a special tranquility. Deserves to be viewed at sunrise and sunset so you need a few days. A must see for all Australians. If you are interested in the Geology there is very little information available so read up before you arrive. If you are interested in the cultural aspects there is a “mountain of information” at the cultural centre.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It’s worth the planning, the effort and cost. Come here when it’s not too hot and it is sensational! This is an impressive rock with many interesting facets as you view it at different times of the day and as you walk around it. The 10.6km walk is amazing. If you are a photographer or anyone that appreciates natural beauty you will enjoy this place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Really special to visit this site. Beautiful area and a few nice walks. Would definitely recommend doing any of the walks as early as possible as it gets pretty hot. Also a fly shield net will vastly improve your experience (the flies are super annoying and definitely all up in your business)! Toilets and water available. Free parking.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Went on a Sunset plus base tour with AAT kings. Got upclose to the rock and its huge anything beyond what the pictures depict. Was advised its about 550 million years old and about 7 km deep.Some of the rock paintings are almost 10,000 years old. Also visited the Aboriginal cultural centre before to learn about the Anangu people who now hold custody of the place. Didnt notice the rock change colour during sunset but saw change colour during sunrise in the camel ride. A must visit place in the heart of Australia."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Incredible landmark. Must see. Entrance $25/person. Mala walk parking: free. Uluru base walk: 3 hours. 1lt of water per hour per person. Tracking shoes. “Do not climb”. Mosquito net for face - must. Watch Sunset at sunset carpark with snacks-easy.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Looking at Uluru in books and online is nothing compared to its magic in person. The colours constantly change and its amazing
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is massive and impressive. Some people go at sunrise to see the sun change its color. We went at sunset and it was beautiful. Bring chairs, wine, and snacks and enjoy. The cultural center and water hole are interesting."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Desert awakenings tour is the only one run by the local Aboriginal Council and is truly spectacular! Our tour guide Toby was a master. He was informative, funny, pleasant and extremely knowledgeable. Thanks Toby for an amazing day!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I did wonder, before going, if Uluru was worth more than half an hour's view - it's just a big rock after all - but, with the right guide, the sunrise viewing, the sunset viewing and the beautiful walks at nearby Kata Tjuta, this is well worth at least two full days of your time. Do get the right person to tell you the geology and the Aboriginal stories of the area but the views themselves are wonderful."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I went on a Sunset and base tour with AAT kings and the rock is unbelievably huge with close up. Made of red sandstone you find Aboriginal paintings nearly 10,000 years old on the rocks. Highly recommended a visit and was disappointed with the sunset as I didn't see the rock change colour. I saw the rock change colour in the sunrise tour with the camels."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Same rock so many images, as the light changes and as you move around it Uluru takes on many different personas. Sun rise to sun set, north to south, east to west take the time to admire this unique piece of nature. If you are walking around it I suggest anti clockwise is the way to go as you get so up close and personal with the rock you can't help but be hooked into the spell and the stories. Investigate all the side paths as they all have points of interest to add to your experience. FYI - Buy the fly net head covers from the town square, the flies at Uluru are 20 times worse than they are at the resort."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Incredible sight especially for sunrise and sunset. The rock changes color by the minutes. At the peak - it turns bright orange. Do walk around the rock especially kata Tjuta (50km away). Spectacular scenery - walk when it is cool (too dangerous if temperature is 36C and above). You will need 3 days to take in all (because most of the day are too hot to do any activity) and the minimum 3 days pass A$25 per person. Accommodation, food & gasoline is very expensive. Must visit at least once in a lifetime"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This has to go on every Aussies bucket list. It is an Aussie icon and absolutely worth a visit. It is a spectacular sight to see both at sunset and sunrise. There are vantage points set up around the rock to get great views. You can do a lot around here, walk, ride a bicycle, Segway or drive around the base. We were lucky enough to climb. The rock is closed a lot of the time for climbing, if it’s too windy, too hot, chance of rain or an aboriginal significant event. The climb was a great achievement for us and we really wanted to do it before it closes in Oct 2019. We are so glad we got to. It is an amazing sight as you drive into Yulara, a huge majestic rock pops up out of nowhere. It is just as amazing from the top of the rock. I haven’t done it, but would be fantastic to see from a plane or helicopter. A great place to visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,In the middle of the outback this amazing site rises up and is just beautiful. Viewing it at different times of the day displays colors and images you thought you previously saw but and instead are revealed anew. Well worth seeing and exploring the area.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is one of those sights that has to be seen in real life. You could go around the rock time after time and see something new every time; it can look so different depending on the light and time of day. We cycled around the base which was a great way to see it. Highly recommended, though try to go in the cooler months!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No words can describe the beauty of this natural wonder , heart of Central Australia , our family arrived early to take in sunrise , a 2.5 hr walk to the top and back , we later walked a small section of the base and drove around the base , it was warm in April so recommend an early start. Spectacular"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"First off, I won't call it Ayers Rock. It is correctly called Uluru. That's what the aboriginal people call it. It is a beautiful and spiritual place. To see it, really see it, is to know it's history and it's meaning. A stop at the Aboriginal Culture Center can help you there. We had the opportunity to see it at sunset, as the colors went from ocher to orange to rust to almost purple. The view and color changes were stunning. A visit at sunrise would be equally exciting. One word about climbing Uluru... don't. Much damage has already been done to the monument. It is disrespectful to the aboriginal people. Would you climb the Taj Mahal or St. Peter's Basilica? It is a long trek to visit Uluru. But it is worth the trip."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,There are tons of signs asking folks not to climb the rock it being a sacred site (and they won’t be able to in a few years) so why do people still want to climb it? 🙄. A flynet is an absolute must if you want to stop even for a second to take pictures. If you don’t want to rent a car and can’t join a tour due to limited time I recommend the Hop on Hop Off tour which is a separate company (and not as heavily advertised as some other tours.) The sunrise helicopter ride was spectacular and worth every penny.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is one of the most magical and spectacular places I have visited in my life. It is a must if you are in Alice Springs and worth the trip if you are visiting Australia. Check it out at sunrise and sunset - it changes colour. So many stories, culture and culture."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It’s magnificent in the sunrise / sunset lighting. Also, it can be a challenge in the midday heat. We did the Mala Mala walk on bikes with was great with kids."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The site itself is nice, and its spiritual value is to be respected in consideration for local Aboriginal residents. But this is not worth the outrageous costs to get here. You'll be trapped in one and only ""resort town"" owned by the Accor. Accommodation and food are way overpriced. Hotel service (we stayed at the Outback Pioneer) was the absolute worst in the industry. There is nothing special to do here that you can't find somewhere else. Skip this and use the budget to finance an entire trip for the next destination on your bucket list."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is definitely a must see in Australia, and any pictures just can't do it justice, you have to see it to truly appreciate the size and scale. I did the 10km base walk which took about 3 hours. At a more leisurely pace it may take about 4 hours. A number of people still complete a climb of Uluru however aboriginal people who are custodians of the area have asked for people not to do the climb and respect the sacred area. The climb will be closed in the next couple of years but the walk around is still a great opportunity to see the sights."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Amazing natural wonder ! Nothing written can come close to the personal experience of this magnificent site.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Unique and out of this world experience , loved it, every bit of Uluru was unique, has its own story to tell, it takes you back thousands of years to the people of this land Visitor information centré in the park will help you get all details you want went in mid April , temperatures were still a bit high, bet 35-37, take lots and lots of water Flys are a complete pain, wouldn't even let you take photos Important notes ** rent a car, the best way to get about, and gives you a lot of time to explore Cars are usually with a 100km mileage limitation, ( check it before you book) You get a pass for 72 hours for 25/pp , we bought the passes on our first day late evening, was good enough time to cover both Ayers and the Olgas sunset and sunrise- amazing changes in colour , well worth it, there are clearly marked sunset watch and sunrise watch places, go there at least 30 min before the sunrise/sunset, it can get crowded There are few walks at the base of Uluru , some for 1hr, some for 1.5hrs also you can do 3hr walk around Uluru or rent a bicycle for 3 hrs and cover the same in 1 1/2 hr (bicycle rental is 100 pp) , thy have Segway tours too, I thought that wasn't as great as it dosent give you the opportunity to explore on your own There is a free guided tour at the base of Uluru (starting Mala walk car park) everyday at 8am, this is about 1hr, and great for kids, as the ranger explains every detail What to bring Lots and lots of water (you can buy from the local IGA, we bought a 24 case for 2 people and it was all gone before we left) If you are planing to buy alcohol, bring from outside, no alcohol sold any where other than the resort, there is only one bottle shop run by the resort, and that can be expensive and very few types to choose from Fly screen head cover , this is essential , flys won't let you even breath , can buy this from the town square (near the IGA) Few food options available, at the resort, and other resort run restaurants. Lot of walking to do, so recommend good walking shoes that covers,"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Attended to climb before its officially closed in 2019 (17.4.2018). Was there on a perfect day at 7 am. Rangers closed it due to wind (it was windy at 7 am) After 12 pm its the best weather you can get and still closed. Supposed to be reviewed every 2 hrs. No one even turned up as i was waiting for the re assessment. On the bureau of meteorology it was fine. So dont expect to ever climb it as they will make up any reason to still take your money and still close and not re assess at all. Waste of money and wont be coming back. Negative 5 stars.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is different to all my other holidays. It is in the outback, but I am glad I come with my partner, we had 4 wonderful days here. I would recommend all to go visit this place just once. We are glad we did"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,No if’s no but’s- just visit. Best time is March to May. Could not have been happier with going. Adding Kata Tjuta and Kings Canyon completes the trip. Add in the Fields of Light show and the dinner on the dunes at sunset an excellent short holiday. Do it!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To see this rock out the windscreen of the car when getting close was incredible and even more so once out of the car. Once in a lifetime opportunity to see the majestic sight up close. We did not walk up, mostly due to the cultural sensitivity issues but also because it was very steep, very high and that rock is hot!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is stunning and the pictures don't do justice to the varied landscape around the rock including hidden caves and valleys. So it is definitely worth taking a tour to walk around the base. There is a 12km track. In theory it can be done solo but our guide knew all the interesting spots. It is also worth going at sunrise or early morning for the colours and also because it's cooler. The trail is closed if temperatures rise above 36 degrees so check before going.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is worth of visiting but can not be compared to King's Canyon - totally different places. Yulara resort has good services and basically caters to every budget. Sunset and sunrise are worth to see but if you wanna see the whole thing - be at time. For example sunrise you should be at lookouts before the horizon starts to change color. Going around Uluru is ok by bike after sunrise watching but if you want to walk - you should start walking before sunrise - it will be hot by 10.00 am. Plenty of water recommended to have with you! We didn't climb to the top in order to respect wishes of the indigenous people. Otherwise this place is amazing! Highly recommended! This is a MUST and a bucket list place!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My husband and I, my brother his wife and son from the UK spent 3 nights at the Desert Gardens Hotel we had a wonderful mini break. The flight with Jetstar was great even though we had a no frills booking, we bought a toasted cheese and ham sandwich on board which was hot and tasty, service was faultless and flight staff delightful. We stayed at the Desert Gardens Hotel which desperately needs a refurbishment particularly the swimming pool which in a word was daggy. The staff were well groomed and helpful though service was too slow at times, the rooms could have been cleaner and room service was almost none existent. The shuttle bus service was really good, I felt that the small shopping centre desparately needs a pharmacy, I needed a Ventolin puffer !! The highlight of our trip was the Sounds of Silence event so special, a wonderful experience the welcome canapes and cocktails the fantastic didgeridoo player and the dinner itself was fabulous, the astronomer only added to the magic, all in all something I am so glad I didn't miss."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is one of those places you have to go to believe it, the colours at sunset and sunrise are unbelievable! We visited the cultural centre to get an understanding on what the rock actually is and to learn the aboriginal culture and stories around this rock - fascinating. There's a sign politely asking people not to climb - unbelievable the amount of disrespect people show by ignoring it and climbing, still it's their choice. We opted to do the base walk around it - aim to finish the walk by 11am ish because the heat is unbelievable and with heat comes more bush flies... the flies!!! Oh gahd so many flies. In hindsight we should have bought a couple of face nets upon arrival as by the third day here I was ready to leave just because of the flies"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We booked a tour with AAT Kings (Center Highlight Plus Superior), and did our independent airline reservations on Air Australia. This is an awesome trip and AAT King did a first class service from start to finish. From the first time I contacted the company the staff was so helpful and provided all the necessary information I needed. Once we arrived at the Red Rock airport, we were greeted by a ground service representative, given verbal and written instruction, and upon checking in at Desert Sails hotel the receptionist gave us additional information. AAT King provided a 5 star service from start to finish, I highly recommend using this company( found them on Trip Advisor).Also, the hotel Desert Sails is a 5 star hotel and the rooms were very spacious and clean with excellent service, we really enjoyed this hotel. The city center is a walking distance to the hotel, very convenient."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Nothing prepares you for this experience and the scale of the rock. We did a base walk, but there are shorter options."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We did a three day bush camping trip We stayed in tents which were very basic but you are in the outback It was great meeting other people from different countries on our trip. Uluru was spectacular we did the sunset trip and guess what !! It rained but to see the thunder and lightening was brilliant ant the water falling from the rock like waterfalls was something special. We The sunset walk around the rock at our own pace which was lovely .after that we were on the road to kings canyon which was a lovely trip we done the 2 k climb which was enough for me 😂And the views were lovely after that we were on a 5 hour drive to end our trip at Alice springs arrived quite late so didn't really see anything of it as we had an early flight to Hamilton island . Would defiantly recommend this trip really enjoyed it
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Food was done by Indian chefs versus locals. No local people were involved. Food was average at best. Talk on stars wasn't that good, speaker didn't seem that interested. Maybe it was the cloudy weather and not a great view of stars. View was much closer and better the next night when we drove to Uluru on our own. Recommend you do it on your own and eat at a restaurant closer to the hotels."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We visited with our two kids aged 11 and 13. We loved the bike ride around the base (hire or bring your own). Sunset viewing is a must. Definitely worth a visit.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is an amazing place to visit, rising, as it does, from the desert floor. To see Uluru with the setting or rising sun on it is a very special experience. As is walking in its shadow and visiting the caves and waterholes which all have special meaning in Aboriginal Law."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"3 hour walk around the base of Uluru, take plenty of water you will need it! Once past the first 20 mins of the walk Uluru is all yours. Lots of photo's, some sections request you don't photograph. Enjoy the peace and quite of this sacred place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Unique experience worthwhile doing! Sunset view is just amazing with the rock changing color and a glass of champagne to enjoy the experience.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you have time, walk all the way around the rock. It is amazing and so different depending on the section. Take the time to soak up the spiritual feeling. I would like to see a couple more covered resting seats, especially in the area where people begin their walk on the rock (unsure why they need to of course), but in the heat, a couple more covered rest areas would be well appreciated."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We spent a couple days here. If you truly want the full experience, please go to the Cultural Center first! You will learn about the relationship between Uluru and the the native peoples. You will learn stories about the rock which will make viewing much more interesting and enjoyable. The rock itself is beautiful and the sunrise and sunset transforms it before your eyes. The pictographs are fascinating. You must see Uluru both up close and from a distance. There are hiking trails around the rock (the one that goes up the rock is discouraged as it is a sacred place and the Aboriginals feel it disrespectful). Take lots of water, wear good shoes, sunscreen, insect repellant & keep your eyes open!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A must do!! We hired a car & visited the rock numerous times over 4 days. The hikes are amazing. Make sure you view a sunrise & sunset as the colours are phenomenal. Also, make sure you purchase a fly net to cover your face, the flies are atrocious. Was absolutely blown away by our visit!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited in March on a tour . It’s very dry and hot. You must drink a lot of water or you will dehydrate. There are a lots of flies that will try to enter your eyes,nose and mouth. We wore mosquito netting masks. Friends had warned us that we would need them,so bought them on Amazon before we left for under $5. I saw them in the little town near our hotel for $15. They are a must. Uluru is a beautiful and spiritual place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went on the night dinner under the stars trip to Uluru, and it was fabulous value for money as well as enlightening. The food was excellent, and the entertainment superb. We then went to the field of light which was awesome. Would Highly reccomend this"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have been fortunate to visit many places in the world, but this is up there with the best of them! If you ever get the chance to visit here, then do, you see it at sunrise or sunset, take the Base Walk or Mala Walk , it is magical !"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This Rock simply makes you feel very small and insignificant compared to its sheer size and rugged beauty, to stand with a glass of Red (or white) in your hand while watching the sunset change the colours of Uluru is almost spiritual. I only wish we had driven up here ourselves so we could spend more time that the tours allow to really appreciate this attraction."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Walking around the base was a highlight of our weekend. You can easily do it yourself in about three hours. Up close is when you really see the differences as you walk around - so different than I expected from looking at from a distance
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This place is one of the few UNESCO World Heritage sites for two aspects: unique landscape but also cultural significance. Uluru is a highly spiritual place. Even if you are non-aboriginal you can feel it everywhere. You will get the most out of your visit if you open your mind and heart. There is plenty of opportunity to take it in by walking around it (3 - 4 hours). You can show your respect to the tradiditonal owners by taking pictures only where it is allowed. Many guided tours for more in depth information are available and the Cultural Centre exhibition offers a good introduction into a very complex culture, the oldest living culture on the planet. Congratulations you made it here! You might take home a lot more than just a ""ticked box""."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The rock - known until recently as Ayers Rock, and the park and tasteful attractions around it are worth the flight or long bus/car ride to the center of Australia. The degree the colour and appearance of the rock changes in different life is breathtaking. The aboriginal legends are thought provoking. Appreciated how the guides spoke of and demonstrated respect for aboriginal culture"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I like natural wonders and my two teenage children accompanied me on this expensive side trip to the Australian Outback. We bought a package from SEEIT that included a guided tour of walking Ulura and Kata Tjuta and seeing Ulura at Dusk and Dawn. The thing I liked was it was remote and not too crowded. But BRING A HEAD COVERING for the flies--they don't sting but are a pain of a nuisance and were ruining it for my daughter. My son and I barely tolerated the flies, but wish we brought our covers from Boy Scout outings. (The guide said bug spray did not work) The color changes were nice to see. I compare the adventure to seeing Old Faithful blow or El Capitan in Yosemite shine. For my teenage kids, its was a nice 'rock."" They are adventuresome, but it was their least enjoyed activity after being to Sydney and Cairns. My kids and I were the youngest people around this site. As I said, it was remote and very warm, but that was its appeal. The average age if the visitors was around 65 in my opinion, which was impressive given the walking. I'm glad I went, but I doubt I'll be back--just too expensive to fly and stay."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We signed on for the Desert Awakenings tour commencing at 5.00am in order to watch the sunrise. This was a five hour small group tour with an excellent guide, Serena Song. Lots of close encounters on foot at the base of the rock which far surpassed our expectations, I strongly recommend this tour which was the highlight of our trip."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I travelled to Uluru with a friend, we arrived on a Friday afternoon and drove from the airport pretty much straight over to the national park at about 3pm. The weather was cool and very overcast so we decied to do the base trek. It took us just on 2 hours to do and was worth it! Everytime we looked up at the rock it looked completely different. It did rain on and off but that was a good thing as it cooled us off and kept the flies away. We went back to Uluru the day we flew out as the weather was sunny and fine and gave us a completely different perspective! The atmosphere at Uluru is one I cant describe, its utter remoteness and seclusion coupled with this rock that appears out of nowhere! If you are travelling to Australia it is definitely worth a visit!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We did the tour with Adventure Tours (2 nights-Uluru and Kings Canyon) Uluru is magnificent. We saw it at sunset then took the option of a base walk at dawn for sunrise. Truly spectacular. A must see site. Fantastic.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Go somewhere else and experience Australia without fences, thousands of tourists and without getting ripped of by expensive entry fees, food, accommodation etc"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did the base trek with SEIT tours. This was truly brilliant, we learned so much. The group size is far smaller than their competitors which we prefer. The path is flat the whole way around and although it's definitely a long walk, it doesn't have any inclines so it's not really challenging. We had a great time but would definitely recommend doing it with SEIT, they really did make it come alive."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a wonderful time! As a family of 4 adults and 4 children (2 teenagers - 2 younger), we did an AAT Kings Sunset tour and an AAT Kings Sunrise & Kata Tjuta tour with Jason - both brilliant. We then hired a car and drove to the base of the Rock and did a guided walk around the base. We did not expect to learn so much about the traditional owners and caretakers of the area, the Anangu and were amazed by the diversity of vegetation and the waterholes at the base of the rock. This was an absolutely amazing and magical experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did the Uluru Sunrise/guided walk tour and the Kata Tjuta sunset tour, both with Jason as our guide. Of the many, many tours we have done, this was the best. Jason knew the area so well and had many, many interesting stories. He made a special star gazing stop and pointed out galaxies, stars, constellations, and satellites. The two tours were fantastic."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Like most Australians, i have wanted to go to the rock since childhood. the first glimpse for us, was through the planes window, what a majestic sight. At ground level i was surprised by the amount of greenery and the abundance of trees. I thought it was going to be void of vegetation, and completely flat. We went three days in a row, and each day it's 'closed' for numerous reasons, it's not supposed to be permanently closed till October."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Once there, I really got obsessed with Uluru. I booked 2 sunrise tours, one early morning hike around the base and one from Kata Tjuta, from which you can watch the sunrise with Uluru from about 35 km. Amazing. I also participated in the sunset Camel Back Tour and watched the sunset as part of the Field of Lights Tour. Watching the color of Ayers Rock change within a few minutes is just breathtaking. To top it all up, on my last day at Uluru, I also rented a bike and casually went around the base again during the late morning, with frequent photo stops. It was just perfect. Highly recommend visiting this place. If you have only one or two days to spend, I would go for the sunrise hike tour and the Field of Lights expierience, including the sunset view."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My friend and I did the sunrise base walk tour with AAT Kings ... what an amazing experience. Watching the sun rise over Uluru and the changing colours over the rock face was breathtaking. The walk was long but enjoyable in every way possible. Trys, our guide was exceptional. Warm and entertaining he made the trip all the more memorable. His wonderful aboriginal stories and knowledge allowed us an insight into aboriginal culture. Our driver Greg was also very efficient and helpful. Uluru is a mystical and spiritual place not to be missed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our visit was in 1987, the rangers were very helpful and excellent knowledge. The sunrise was spectacular. Escorted tour of the base, by a ranger, was brilliant."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is a must see attraction. It is so majestic and it’s sheer size is awesome. I would recommend doing the free ranger guided Mala walk which commences at 8.00am each morning from the base of the rock climb point. I would also recommend a self guided walk on the Kuniya walk out to the Mutitjulu Waterhole. A visit to the Cultural Centre is also a must as is a viewing of the rock at Sunrise and Sunset from the specially positioned viewing platforms. Five out of Five.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"On our first evening we watched the sun set over Uluru from the suggested car sunset area and watching the colours change was breathtaking and so peaceful. We would recommend leaving the resort 20mins prior to sunset time. The next day we had intended to do the base walk but felt we wouldn't have time before 11am (suggested time to be out of sun) so instead did the Mala Walk (45mins) and drove the whole way round to the Kuniya Walk (40mins). They were both flat walks and combined with the drive around and a trip to the Cultural Centre and stopping to read signs we felt we covered a lot. When the wind blew through the grass you could feel the history swirl around you. Ensure to bring plenty of water, fly nets and snacks as it's expensive. As we rented a car we did not have to rely on bus timetables and were quite flexible. We bought a 1-3 day park ticket to cover our entrance, it costs $25 per person in the car."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We visited Uluru as part of a one day tour with Emu Run. This included two Uluru base walks - Mala walk and the Mutitjulu waterhole. We then were taken to a viewing point to enjoy a BBQ while watching the sunset over Uluru.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have to admit, this was never on my “bucket list”. I never really thought I would ever visit here. However, my partner suggested that we visit, so I agreed. As we were driving closer and you could see glimpses of it in the distance, I was becoming excited. It was quite an amazing experience as you saw it fully in view directly in front of you. We walked around the base, then saw it at sunset and again at sunrise. Absolutely stunning! A beautiful, magestic landmark! This is a place you can easily connect with the true spirit of Australia!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I am Australian and this have known about Uluru for many years, but have visited for the forest time! No photo or description I have ever read has done this place justice. The sheer size and peacefulness of Uluru is mesmerizing. Please do not believe that if you’ve seen it in images you’ve done it. Being here gives it scale and context and nothing can replace that!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The first glimpse of Uluru was flying in to AYQ airport, I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE SIZE OF IT...! I went with the intention to climb the rock but that all changed and I had no desire to climb it once I was there something I can't describe.... The ever changing colour, the dream time stories and the richness of the land is something you really have to experience for yourself. I did a sunrise tour around the rock but the highlight was riding a bike around the base. Exercise clothes and sneakers (no need for hiking clothes) were perfect to explore don't forget your hat and sunglasses."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is just magic, I can't put into words how much I loved it. It overwhelms you when you first lay eyes on it. It's beautiful and should be seen at different points during the day. We were lucky to view it at sunrise, sunset and throughout the day. Just lovely."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have waited 30 years to visit Uluru and we had just one full day here today. It was perfect, with a sunrise visit to Uluru and an afternoon walk at Walpa Gorge. The day was spent in the Romany of Mika, our guide from Seit tours. She was extremely knowledgeable about the geology, the flora & fauna as well as both the European and indigenous history of the area. On top of that, Mika was good company and made the day complete joy, despite the heat! So glad she was my guide for an unforgettable day. Would recommend her and this small tour company to anyone visiting.k"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Our third visit to Central Australia and the changes are dramatic in tourism. Thank goodness tourism has evolved to protect these natural wonders and there will be no more climbing after 2019. There are still so many wonderful things to see from afar and the natural colours and sights remain as beautiful and wonderous as we experienced on each of other visits. This time we saw the man-made Field of Lights which was our essential reason for the visit this time. We enjoyed this experience but in hindsight should have attended the Star Pass to view from a different angle.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Nothing can compare you for the beauty - the pictures don’t do it justice, all we wanted to do was look in wonder at the rock. It’s always changing in different lights. So amazing to see in person!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I travel extensively and this site is simply life-changing. Uluru sits in an incredible landscape. Hire a car- do not join rushed conventional tours or you will muss both the beauty and magic. The indigenous history is profound and moving. If you are looking for an extra-special trip- ULURU is it. It is worth the flight in to experience an entirely different Australia.i spent a week here. Do not organise 1 night.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,To admire this famous rock and think about the Aboriginals life and tradition is something I have longed for. When we got there appr 20 coaches unloaded crowds of people gathering around tables with drinks and snacks. So here we were; loads of people watching the “sunset”( it was a cloudy night) while some Aborigines sat on the ground trying to sell their paintings. The rock and the nature is magnificent though.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well worth the visit to this Australian Wonder; we were there in February 2018 and due to the heat many of the walks were closed in the afternoon, however you can drive around the base and get a fabulous look at this monolith. Excellent viewing areas for photos and some of the shorter walks were available to do. We took a Sunrise Helicopter Flight over Uluru and Kata Tjuta (The Olgas). Certainly recommend any tourist do this, great commentary from our pilot."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes it is a long way from anywhere but worth the visit and genuinely awesome when your first see it. I jogged around the base track to do the whole track, and then we did the free ranger tour. The Ranger tour was good and offered a little insight into the history. We saw sunrise and sunset - it was very crowded but we managed to get a decent spot (even if it was a little cold!) Stunning place to visit - but I still prefer Kings Canyon and The Olgas!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We were travelling as part of a Distant Journeys Tour of Australia and stayed 1 night. The standard of the room wast excellent and the breakfast choice was the best of the tour by far; taking into consideration the remote location this was a great achievement. We enjoyed the cook your own BBQ in the adjacent hotel which included salad; the food and drink prices were very reasonable. Definitely would recommend a stay if you are visiting Ayers Rock.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It has taken me a long time to get here and it is definitely well worth the trip. It was definitely hot and the flies are insane, however, Uluru is great. We did a guided tour with the Ranger which was insightful. You can walk around the base of the rock, hire bikes and ride around or do a Segway tour. Sunsets and sunrise are great and it is lovely to see all the different colours of the rock in the different light."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow stunning. Yes it is a rock but wow. We did sunrise and there are a lot of people who want to see it. Stick around, everybody goes back for breakfast so you have the rock for you alone"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This place will leave you unique memories and its worth the (expensive) trip. You’ll find all details in the other reviews but in brief: 1) if possible rent a car , you’ll be more free and see better the sunset 2) Follow the suggestion I found on a website post: shortly after seeing the sunset from the closest view point, drive to the sunrise hill viewpoint (it takes 10 minutes) . you will be alone with a great view of the rocks from a different perpsective; 3) visit the other site of Kata Tyuta where you can walk and climb close to the red rocks with much less people ; 4) the sunrise field of lights in the morning is quite fascinating and worth the price. Enjoy!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We travelled along way to experience both the sunrise and sunset over Uluru Rock. We were not disappointed. It provides a lasting vivid memory. Uluru Rock lived up to all our expectations and rates among the best sites and experiences in the world
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We joined a tour from our hotel that escorted us around the base and explained the geology and cultural significance of Uluru. Up close or from a distance it is quite beautiful. Sunrise, mid day or at sunset, your pick, it is breathtaking."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The walk around the base is a challenge, but you get to see it all. You can hire a bike too, if that suits you better. Be prepared for the heat and bring plenty of drinks and snacks for the walk. There is lovely waterhole for a shady rest stop."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After a hot day most people want to cool down in the pool, but the pool closes at 7pm. There were a lot of people wanting to go in the pool as it was 40 degrees today. And the office says its open to 9pm but at 8pm we were told no its closed. We expected the prices to be high for everything here and weren't disappointed. The indigenous community that looks after the national park do a good job, and we realised that all goods have to be trucked in or by air so that puts the prices up. And Diesel today was $1.99 per litre, so be aware if travelling here you will pay to get what you need. Other than that we enjoyed our stay."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We took 1day Uluru tour from Alice Springs provided by EmuRun and it was perfect. The coach, all day food service and 2 guided walks were all as we had expected to be it like. Really recommend it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our group of 6 enjoyed our half day tour of Uluru. It was interesting to learn how Uluru was formed and it's significance to the Aboriginals. It is amazing to ""get up close"". Seeing Uluru at sunset is beautiful ... The color spectacular. Have wine and appetizers made it like a party. We are so glad we did this."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We drove from Sydney to Uluru and it was well worth the drive. Uluru is AMAZING!!! Beautiful and astonishing from afar and up close. I would highly recommend to go there and don't miss out. The sunrise was amazing also, yes its early but well worth it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have wanted to visit Uluru for 20 years and finally had the opportunity. It did not disappoint that is for sure. Our family of 4 (kids 15 & 8) did a sunrise base walk which was magical. We also hired a car and went back a different evening to watch a sunset which was equally stunning. Photos don't do this place justice, it is a place that has to be seen in order to appreciate its size & beauty. So grateful to have spent time here with my family."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"4am start with 4 little ones was never going to be easy ! Booked with Seit tours and was certainly not disappointed! 9 of us in total and felt like a personal visit to this amazing place! Emily our guide was awesome, knowledgeable and great with the kids Highly recommend SEIT and if your lucky you’ll get Emily to take you on a magical tour of a sunrise at Ularu!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I did the Uluru base tour and sunset. Great guide, loved the watering hole. Great opportunity for photos and to sit on the bench that Wills and Kate sat on! A fly net over your head would be a good investment cos the wildlife is a bit irritating."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I couldn't get enough of Uluru. It is so steeped in history and the Aboriginal people have done so much with the national park to educate you on their culture, what you are seeing, and what you may experience. Uluru has so many facets and feels different at each stage of daylight - specifically at sunset at the car park and at the talinguru nyakunytjaku viewing area. These were my favorite locations because they have a very wide viewing area, so regardless of how packed it is you still get an individual experience. I did not like the Kata Tjuta viewing area (people say it isn't as crowded for sunrise) this is NOT true and the viewing platform is very small so people were climbing all over each other to get a photo. It made the experience a lot less special. One of the most unique parts of our visit was seeing Uluru after a storm! There were waterfalls all down the sides, the drinking holes were filled, and a lot more animal life was present! Biggest advise is to go early, bring a lot of water, and buy a fly net for your face! So beautiful there - I miss Uluru every day :)"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had high expectations for our trip to Uluru and the national park did not disappoint. Truly a stunning area, lots of information and spots to explore. The Olgas are equally as beautiful so don't miss heading over there to explore. Big thank you to our guide who took us on the Mala walk. This is free and starts at 8am each day - Well worth joining in."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just stunning. Having seen Uluru in so many photos, seeing it for real was amazing - well worth the trip. Different appearances at sunrise, sunset and throughout the day from different angles - would advise taking time there to appreciate the area. Good to gain understanding of the cultural significance through looking around the visitor centre, and the information signs displayed around Uluru. Lots of flies / mosquitos around - take insect repellent!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was dubious about visiting uluru thinking 'its just a rock' but I was surprised at how much my family and i enjoyed it. We done the walking tour walking around the bottom of uluru, well worth the money and the heat, it's very interesting to see. Also done field of light and sunset viewing."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited January 10-14 and hired a Corolla with Avis. This meant we could drive to Uluru and Kata Tjuta many times each day and experience sunrise, sunset, electrical storms, torrential rain....anytime we wanted! It was so much more flexible and less expensive than tours, and with children it meant that we could be more flexible with toilet stops, water stops, tantrum stops etc. We are both runners and ran the base walk on two mornings and had the incredible privilege of being at Uluru, alone, with the Rock streaming with waterfalls. One of the most amazing experiences of our lives and a lot cheaper than the Outback Marathon weekend ;) Hire a car, ride a bike, hike, get out there and just see this immense incredible place in any and every way you can."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Beautiful and amazing ezperience. Came to see the sunrise but unfortunately the rain came, however still look magical. Saw deep red colours and got to go closer and look. I choose not to climb out of respect. Was just as beautiful to look at it. Would love to come again to see the sun out. Unfortunately couldnt do the field of the lights due to the rain."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"An early morning call at 04:00 is not what you want on holiday but to see the sunrise it has to be an early start. It was a short distance from the hotel and we were treated with a hot choc,tea or coffee and cookies. We made our way to the many viewing points that are available to wait for the sun to rise. The changes that takes place in a short period of time is breath taking. The feelings that you experience form the silence is indescribable. Although there is not a dress code for this visit it would be advisable to wear substantial closed in footwear as the surfaces are very dusty (red dust) and are uneven."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru (Ayers Rock) is an absolutely wonderful place. The first day took a walk around the base. There are signboards describing various parts of the rock and the significance to the culture of the local aboriginal people. It was fantastic to view the rock at different times in the day and how the shadows change. In addition to Uluru there is also Kata Tjuta, which is also a sacred place. As I was staying three days I was also able to take trip to Kings Canyon which is about 3 hours drive from Uluru. I would highly recommend a trip there."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our sunrise visit to Uluru was included on our tour to Australia. Up early, about 05.00 pick up from our hotel. This was awesome, our guide showed us a really good place to stay , we could go back to the truck for tea, coffee and cookies. We have some amazing photos and memories to last forever. Our guide also took us to see the waterfall, rock art which was brilliant, told us all about the Aboriginal beliefs too. Really worth getting up for !!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is much more than a rock. It is beautiful. The colors, composition and the way it stands out against the flat arid surroundings is impressive. We would have liked to bicycle around it but the track was closed due to the rains. That was a bummer. However since we had a car which you must, we were able to drive a round and take walks"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Here are our tips if you want to complete the Uluru Base Walk. 1. Make sure you have your National Park Pass (or you can purchase it on the way in) 2. Leave the resort area at 4.30am to be at the park entrance by 5am (check daily opening time) 3. Leave your vehicle at the Mala Car Park. 4. Complete the Base Walk by going anti-clockwise (we were given this advice by a local). It means when you are completing the end of the walk you are not walking into the sun. 5. Respect the various requests for no photographs or video. 6. Make sure you have a wide brimmed hat, fly net, long sleeve shirt and good walking shoes. Plenty of water and snacks. It’s a wonderful experience, enjoy."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is one for the bucket list and it didn’t disappoint! It is a breathtaking place that is worth seeing. There is only one resort with different standards of accommodation so worth investigating this but highlights for me were the sunset tour and the sunrise tour which also allowed us to walk through one of the canyons of the Kata Tjuta which was fantastic!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So, when Jerri our tour guide from Seit Tours says “this never or rarely happens” and she is noted as the top guide for this tour, then you know it is special. After weeks of watching the weather here with nothing more forecasted than heat and blue skies—it RAINS. Cooling the sacred grounds which permitted us to simply meander this beautiful place. We saw and briefly said hello to Aborigine people (rare) and please, no photos. One of the girls was wearing a Wonder Woman t-shirt. #Power. Actually, there were a few places where photography was not permitted. Just before that visit, the Uluru waterfalls began to flow down into these pools at the base of the Monolith as water is precious in these lands. Even our tour guide Jerri was like...“WOW!!!” The bubbly was being popped to commemorate our adventure and the lightning show began. Clouds in a circular pattern above the Monolith, then 360 degree view of powerful lightning striking all around us in the distance...magnificent. This was on the top of my list before Sydney, it could have not been a more perfect night."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A most beautiful magical area. The rocks and soil are orange whilst the vegetation is a gorgeous grey green. The ghost pines add a feeling of an impressionist painting. Dinner under the stars with The Rock in the background was a one off experience, it was followed by sunrise from Kata Tjuta which is the mountain range facing Uluru. A walk up into the gorge was invigorating with the fierce wind being funneled through the narrow gorge. The ""sandblasting"" effect of the wind is obvious in the form of large holes in the rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you have a bucket list , this needs to be on it. The physical grandeur of Uluru combined with the aboriginal culture is awesome. Park rangers were excellent"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We have been travelling Oz for 4 weeks and this was on our to do list. The trip is a must as the size of Uluru is breath taking. We did the sun set, BBQ and constellation of stars on our first day. The following morning we did the sun rise. If we came back again, we wouldn’t do the BBQ and the constellation of stars as this for us was an expensive extra and at £84 each for the BBQ we felt it was over priced. Be prepared for long journeys and early starts. The history of Uluru is fascinating and is truly worth a visit. After Uluru we stopped at Kata Thursday Walpa. Another beautiful place. Be prepared for very long days, these trips are great value for money but are exhausting."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru was one of the most sacred and meditative places I have visited in my life . The contrast of the red earth versus the blue sky was breath taking. The naturally carved shapes in the rocks have a language of their own. The best season to visit would be March or early November.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It’s taken me to my 50’s to finally visit. I went on an organised tour with Emu Tours from Alice Springs and they really gave a great insight into the history and the aboriginals. The rock is huge! Much bigger than I’d imagined and so many interesting caves, walks and viewing areas."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is the most breathtaking place I have ever visited. The landscape is beautiful, it’s peaceful, spiritual and full of unique cultural experiences that you can’t find anywhere else. I arrived during peak season but managed to book a cabin only a few weeks before departing on my trip (I think I got lucky). I recommend definitely booking well in advance if your travelling during peak season (June-September). For things to do, I highly recommend the sunset camel tour and add on the field of lights tour (if you’re there before March 2018) . It’s a unique way to travel through the desert and see Uluru in the background plus at the end you stop at a fantastic location and drink wine/beer and eat canapés while watching the sunset. The field of lights is a wonderful art piece that hasn’t been done anywhere else. From 8:00pm you will make your way through a maze of different colours in the middle of the dessert. Hire a bike for $45 and ride around the base of Uluru, stopping along the way to read all about the history and stories of the traditional owners of the land. Every afternoon head over to the sunset viewing area. Pack your camp chairs, fold up table, wine and cheese and set yourself up to watch the best show in town! There is an art centre, education centre and sometimes cultural shows plus everyday you can join a free guided walking tour to get that extra information about the oldest culture in the world! While your there don’t forget to go and see the Olgas, the sunsets there are amazing as well and there is a great walk you can do. You will not regret visiting Uluru, it’s a must see. Happy Travels xx"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing place. Don't miss in your Australian trip. Desert area to visit by car. Experience unique, expensive service cost."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The visitor's centre in the town square has a listing. (The hotel's offer only the paid, and usually expensive, options). Free options included: dot painting with an aboriginal local, as well as Leroy our local guide who gave tours on tools / weapons, ecology / history, a garden tour of the local plants, and a food presentation with another guide on use of local plants. So enjoyable!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"How anybody cannot rate a wonder of the world less than 5 stars I do not know. Simply incredible. The first sight is breathtaking (in scale), I saw it in the rain with waterfalls washing down the gulleys, walked the base and revisited later in the afternoon sun when it was brick red. An absolute must. DO NOT CLIMB IT."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Its worth seeing this at lease once. When the sun sets the red color is so different. Sunrise also offers some really spectacular views.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After visiting Sydney and the Reef, we debated going to Uluru vs other destinations in Australia. All in, I’m happy we came to Uluru. The outback is an impressive place, as are Uluru and Kata Tjuta. We were happy to learn more about the native peoples of Australia and really enjoyed our camel ride and Sound of Silence dinner. We got lucky with the weather as it stormed the day before we arrived and the day we left. I’m not sure what you’d do here in those circumstances. Also note that it was insanely hot and buggy in December - it’s not for everyone."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Beautiful as always! Getting to see rain on the rock was stunning. Picturesque and majestic and immense!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Each time I visit Ayers Rock I discover something new. The viewing area has been put back but is raised so the dawn is great and it can accommodate more people. The evening viewing area for the sunset is more cramped unless you pay to go into the ""exclusive"" area for the well heeled. The climb is shut at times and will be closed permanently in 2019."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The resort is always anomalous, but welcoming. Staying in the simple rooms at the hostel was GREAT (but bring a pan to cook in and some crockery/cutlery 😂 The National park is wondrous and nothing beats sunrise over Uluru and Kata-Tjuta. A wonder of the world."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We heard and read different opinions about this place, as we have for much others, like it doesn't worth to spend a couple of days and big money to see a big rock, it's not so big, bla bla bla. Our point of view: it completely does worth it, it's impressive, beautiful and magical. Yes, yo spend some money to come here, but with only one night here, you can see The Olgas and Uluru, and get back with the feeling you have seen something magical which looks like they came from another planet. A real wonder which has to be visited once in a lifetime. Absolutely recommended!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"As you'd expect, Uluru is a true one off and is probably best viewed from a bit of a distance to get a sense of the scale and its dominance over the landscape. It was incredibly hot when we were there so we drove around Uluru and got out at various points to view it closer-up, which was a great way of seeing some of the different views. It's a must visit place, but personally from a purely visual point of view, I found Kata Tjuta to be more dramatic and another must visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is the most magical and amazing place to visit. Sunrise trip with att kings tours was fantastic. Had morning tea Coffee and snacks provide. Went to Uluru just before sunrise. We were told he best position for sunrise to take photos very well organise tour operator very knowledgeable. If you visit Australia this is a must see attraction.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Seen the pictures over the years but it was time to see it for real. It is stunning! Stunning, peaceful, spiritual, magnificent........... To get different perspectives on Uluru see it at different times of the day - day break, during the day, sun set, and at night. The experience changes dramatically at different times. Even more surprising though is Kata Tjuta."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Not something you are likely to see anywhere else in the world. Magnificent. The forms, shapes and caves make this place well worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You visit this part of the world to see the rock. To see it in all its colours you need to visit during the day, at sun set and sun rise. From 2019 climbing the rock will be banned. The climb was closed the day we were there as temperatures were above 30 degrees. Combine your visit with a buffet in the desert and walk through the fields of lights."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is an amazing place and a must visit for everyone. Ayres Rock is enormous and very spiritual. I would suggest you need no more than 3 days in Uluru and the best place to stay is in Yulara. We stayed at “Sails in the desert” and it was great there. We also hired a car as soon as we landed at Uluru airport. I highly recommend doing this. We had that freedom of coming and going back and forth to the rock and other places whenever we wanted. If you don’t want to hire a car there is a hop on hop off bus service but that would mean waiting for the bus to arrive in the desert heat. Hiring a car was also great as we drove to the Olga’s which was about 45kms from Ayres Rock and also great to see. If you are planning on hiring a car, book in advance. Don’t think you can just arrive at the airport and book last minute. Entry in to the National Park was $25pp for a 3 day pass and that’s all we needed. You can come and go as many times as you please. A must do while in Uluru is watch the sunset and sunrise at Ayres Rock. (There are special sunset/sunrise viewing areas of the rock). It is very hot there out in the desert so make sure you are prepared with hats, sunnies, sunscreen etc. It was a magical 3 days we spent there and I recommend this place to anyone wanting to experience the spiritual heart of Australia."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Sunset supposed to be the best view of Uluru. Unfortunately both days we were there for the sunset, it was cloudy so the color was dull. We went there for the sunrise and it was cloudy too. Just our luck. Uluru itself is impressive and still worth our effort to go out there."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There are very few words to describe Uluru. You simply must go if you have the chance. Pictures don't do it justice. In December, it's quite hot, but it's not crowded. For sunset, head to the designated areas, find a quiet spot, if you can, and watch Uluru change colors. It's a calming, breathtaking experience. We went out at 6:00 p.m. for a 7:30 p.m. sunset. Practically had the place to ourselves until 7:00. In summer, lots of walks close early--I'm assuming due to the heat. So we got up early, did the Mala walk--where you get up close, experience some scared places, and learn about Uluru--then headed back to the the Resort around 11:00. Plenty of time for lunch and a swim before heading back out for sunset."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was a must to see. As soon as you get a glimpse of the rock you are mesmerised. How many photos can one take? Lots. We hired bikes and rode around the rock and stopped where we wanted to. Took us 2 hours by bike. Hired a car to get up early to watch the sunrise. Absolutely incredible. Touching & seeing the rock, the experience will live with me forever. So happy."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We spent two days at Uluru viewing both from a distance and up close. A stunning marvel of nature and a magnificent spiritual place. Take your time and be sure to get a good guide to help explain. We used Emu Run and they have excellent guides.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'm not sure how I could possibly put into words how special Uluru is or how to do it better than the hundreds of writers here on this site who've gone before me. Suffice to say it is a deeply spiritual place, very moving, utterly beautiful and compelling and deeply relaxing. The Aboriginals had the right idea about being in tune with nature here, at one with their ancestry amid a deep sense of time and history. The rock is sacred to them and I can see why. Or rather I could feel why. It is stunning to behold at any time but especially when lit by the dawn and it almost glows red. Sunset is similar. It remains one of my strongest memories of my first visit to Australia almost 20 years ago, camping near Uluru watching the sun set. This time I knew what to expect but that didn't diminish it's majesty in any way. A good guide to take you around the base is essential so as not to miss some of the ancient art on the rock and in the caves. An absolute delight and well worth the inevitable long journey to reach it as it is so mercifully far from the madding crowds!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"First I had thought it was only a rock in a desert but I couldn’t be more wrong. The view is spectacular and when you walk around this rock you see the beauty of it. Take the basic walk (10,6 km - 3-4 hours) and watch this beauty from every site. In the evening we went back to see the sunset turning the mountain into orange."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Just a majestic place to see in real life so much better than photos of it I would suggest people to go see this wonderful place
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This huge object is a real must see in the Northern Territory and has some kind of atmosphere but I missed in this place it's magic. I really love coastal cities like Cairns and wild tropical nature or trecking in the mountains (i.e. Grampians or Blue mnts when speaking about Australia). But Uluru is so dry place. There was something that made me feel rather sad.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Did sunset and sunrise tours and had clouds both times so did not see the changes in colour. Very disappointing
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We travelled with AAT King company and the staff were great. Fantastic BBQ in the evening and very informative talk about about local culture, flora, fauna, Milky Way and planets. A really great trip."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Have seen it both in the dry and now the wet season and either one, this place is truly mesmerising. Something EVERY Australian has to see."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a sight to behold, my advise to everyone coming here is to rent a car, so that you can come for sunset, sunrise, or whatever time you feel like. Do not miss the 8am complementary guided walk led by a local guide. Also do not miss the Cultural Centre, it is full of information about the local people, the flora and fauna and animals that live in the area."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing, mystical, legendary and wonderful! Long time wish to visit, better than I thought it could be, so much spirit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We didn't visit Uluru as part of any organised tours, we hired a car at the resort and made our own way to the rock. It is an awesome sight as you drive towards it. Of course there are other impressive rock features in many other parts of the world, but there is something special about Uluru: the way it rises up majestically from a flat desert landscape, the way it dominates the landscape for miles, and the way its appearance changes from smooth featureless rock to deeply pitted and gorged as you get closer to it, and of course the way it takes on different colours at different times of the day and from different perspectives. It is very popular with organised tours and, at busy times of the year, you may find yourself sharing the experience with lots of other people, especially at sunset. We drove out to the rock to see it at sunset and it was very special watching the colour change as the sun went down. At one stage it was that red colour that you see in all the classic photos. We went to the car park at the sunset viewing point. We arrived well before sunset and got a good place to view the rock but the car park soon filled up and there were lots of people. But, despite the crowds, it was peaceful, still and quiet throughout the sunset. Although technically walking up the rock is still allowed it appears that the Park Rangers find lots of reasons for prohibiting access. This did not bother us because we had no intention of walking up the rock as we wanted to respect the beliefs of the indigenous people for whom this rock has strong spiritual significance. But if your only reason for visiting is to walk up the rock, you will probably be disappointed. We completed the trail around the base of the rock. It took us about 2.5 hours. We didn't find it a challenging walk, it is flat with no climbs or descents but there is little or no shade, so we were in the full glare of the sun most of the way round. We started the walk about 30 minutes after sunrise at the end of October so it was quite cool at the start of the walk (I mean cool compared to later in the day) and didn't get too hot before we finished it. If you do the base walk you should take water, wear a hat and apply a high-strength sun block, especially if you do it in the afternoon. The trail goes close to the road at some points which is a bit disappointing, but there was little traffic on the road when we did the walk so it wasn't a problem for us. On one side of Uluru, the side of the Mala car park, the path takes you close to a few other short walks to places of interest which are well worth taking if they aren't too busy. This is the better half of the walk because you are closer to Uluru and there are more trees and shrubs, which provide a bit of shade and interest. On the other half of the walk you are are taken a little bit further away from Uluru and are a bit more more exposed to the sun (although that depends to some extent on the time of the day that you do the walk). Uluru is an awesome natural feature and it can be seen from several different perspectives (close up, at a distance, at sunrise, at sunset) each of which presents it differently. The base walk allows you to see Uluru right up close and to see the many natural clefts and fissures. There are information boards at various points that provide information about plants,wildlife and how the indigenous people lived at Uluru thousands of years ago. A couple of warnings. There are no toilets at any point along the base walk although there are some at the Mala car park and at the Information Centre, both of which are close to the trail. Also, although we were not bothered much, flies can be a big problem depending on the time of day and year. You will need a high-strength insect repellent and if you are doing the walk in summer you may need a fly net over your face."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The main purpose of our visit to Uluru was to hike up Ayers rock before access was closed off for this Aboriginal ""sacred site"". We tried to climb this rock over a period of four days from November 24th thru the 27th, 2017. Every time we showed up at the rock (typically 3 times a day) there was a new excuse on why access was closed: too windy (20 mph, really?) will get to hot today (that is why we were there at 7 am, to climb it when it was cool), the rock is too wet (it rained at 7 pm the night before, the rock was dry), or forecast rain (forecast had showers for 5 pm that evening, again that is why we were there at 7 am (not a cloud in the sky), takes 3 hours for the hike if your slow). Our opinion is that access to climbing the rock is already functionally closed, they are just spinning excuses (in the name of safety) to please the Aborigines. However they don't want to publicize this, because they want to keep the money spigot on. If your main goal (like ours was) to visit the area is to hike up the rock, don't waste your time or money going to it. If you like Aboriginal dot art, and doing some other hikes in the area, go ahead and visit. For my 2 cents there are other better hikes around the Moab, Zion National Park area. If we had known that the access was this bad we would have spent the time and resources to visit the Great Ocean Road instead Good Luck!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"OK the not so good part. It costs $25 for a 3 day entry to the national park. Most people don't stay 3 days, so I think there should be a cheaper day rate or per-entry rate. The sun is not guaranteed to set in a way that lights up your vision with golden red glow. Now the good part. There is a road which completely circles Uluru. We drove this perhaps 90 minutes before sunset in the late afternoon. The sky was clear and blue, the sun was getting low, and the rock was a wonderful brick-red / orange sort of colour. This circular road gets very close to the rock in places. There aren't many designated pull-off spots but we almost had the road to ourselves so we stopped a few times. By the time sunset came we were back in the resort on the viewing hill, actually looking more at Kata Tjuta as the sun set almost behind it. The sky by now had quite a lot of cloud cover, and Uluru didn't 'glow' at all. So we were both glad at the time, and then again at sunset, that we had gone when we did (and had this chance to see great sunset silhouettes in the other direction). To stand within yards of a global icon, a symbol of ancient beliefs. That's quite something. As we drove away we saw the pull-offs for the sunset viewing starting to fill. So if your heart is set on this, don't start from the resort too late."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This place was nothing what I expected. I stayed at the resort and first of get a rental vehicle if you don't want to get stuck in the middle of nowhere and pay big bucks to all this people whom are just making profits of nature and the aborigines. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy my stayed, at least I can say that I went, experienced it and that's all."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Worth the visit although sunset was not spectacular. Guide took us to the base of the rock before the viewing which was excellent as we saw far more than would have done. Had BBQ supper which was excellent and very well organised. Would recommend that add-on
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is a highlight of any trip to Australia. Please respect the aboriginals and DO NOT CLIMB this spiritual site. Nice at sunset with champagne and snacks. It can be crowded. At sunrise, the highlight for me was to see the Southern Cross at Sunrise over Uluru.!!! Wow..can't beat that. Again, be prepared for crowds and many buses. Everyone wants to see it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well worth they travel, this is a must see. Plenty of good photo spots away from the masses if you just do a bit of research and know we’re the sun is. Go early if you want prime position at the viewing points as everyone will turn up."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A must see once in your life. Had some running water due to recent rain which was spectacular. Took the hop on hop off bus so didn't have to do a tour then after a walk around the base walked 2 kms to the cultural centre which was interesting.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A beautiful place and surreal experience seeing the rock face to face. Some beautiful walking tracks around the rock where you can see ancient aboriginal paintings/drawings that are over 20,000 years old. Please respect aboriginal land and DO NOT CLIMB the rock! This is seen as disrespectful - it is the equivalent to stomping on your country flag!! Beautiful viewing point at sunset, which lights up the rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is amazing how mesmerising a massive rock in the centre of Outback Australia can be and it is astounding how many people come to see this massive rock from before sunrise until after sunset. Generally the land around the rock is flat and so Uluru just stands with such a dominating presence. It had been 44 years since I first visited Ayers Rock and this time I was able to share the experience with my wife. Times have changed since 1973 when people were actually encouraged to climb the Rock and receive a certificate to confirm their climb. Now, out of respect for local Aboriginal people, only about 16% of people climb the Rock and this will cease completely in October 2019. Another significant change is the name Uluru being used by almost everyone, instead of calling it Ayers Rock. With fewer people climbing the rock it means more opportunity to explore the rock at the base level and I discovered a water hole, and waterfall when it rains, which I had no idea existed previously. There are sunrise and sunset viewing platforms so you can capture the different colours of Uluru. Often, just standing and looking at Uluru for a while you can see the colours change about every 15 minutes depending on the sun and cloud at the time. Uluru is a must see experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,After passing up this spot on previous trips to Australia we were afraid it wouldn't live up to our expectations. It did.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,5 nights here Superb accomodation and breakfast View of rock from our room Great staff Pool needs an upgrade And some night time entertainment would be great Take your own alcohol if u like to have a drink in the afternoon $32 for a 6 pack ( max per person) can only buy from pub
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did the sunrise tour so a very early start but with the heat I would recommend & in fact you cannot walk around the base after 11am due to the heat. The trail is 12 km & take in the beautiful markings on the rock, every part of it is very different. Our tour guide drove us to the rock & provided tea/coffee/cake/biscuits/fruit. We then met up with another tour guide & aboriginal who described the culture, shared stories of the rock & brought us back in time. They made our visit very spiritual & special - definitely a must see! P.s. don’t forget your fly net & hat"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Has to be seen at sun rise and a small guided tour is well worth while. Unique rock formation and interesting cultural centre.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Great views and a sunset not sunrise visit is okay. Take panoramic shots as well. There are toilets and trails
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I didn't know what to expect as Uluru was not on my Australia bucket list but my traveling companions really wanted to visit so we did. It ended up being one on my favorite parts of our 2 week Australian vacation (Sidney, Uluru, Great Ocean Road and Tasmania). The history of this place is so interesting and goes back thousands of years. Make sure you see both the sun set and sunrise and take the time to walk the trails. It is about 6 miles if you want to do the whole base trail, we did not due to the extreme heat."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is the real reason to visit the area. Great opportunity for landscape photography but can get overcrowded at the lookouts during sun rise and sun set.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There were three of us with all different reasons to visit a Big Red Rock. Obviously everyone has to go? then perhaps you should ask the question why? Is this a tick list because everybody goes & you should go its iconic , or because it is as geological phenomena or spiritual association. To explore the rock you need to get close and then it is very impressive with it looming up as you approach it. The various trails are well established around the rock, although the downside is the amount of people, bikes, segways all sharing the same route, so to try & find a quiet spot just to take everything in, well . . . good luck. There are information boards around telling the various stories of the Aboriginals, you will need a good imagination at times, but no information about the rock itself, how it was formed, its geology, etc. The best & most informative bit of the rock was the free ranger led morning walk, which we realised should be taken before wandering off & exploring the rock on your own. It is also disappointing that you can't get to all parts of the rock or take photos of the most interesting parts."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru was AMAZING. It is quite a sight by itself, but it is also full of stories and a sort of spiritual ""ambience"". You know it is a special place"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When we first set eyes on the rock as we were flying in we knew we had come to a magical place. The rock is awesome and a few facts we learned made it more so. 350 metres above the ground and 6 klms below the ground, how do you get your head around that. Rangers are ready to answer any questions you have and provide a number of interesting talking tours around some areas. these are free and are very interesting and arms you with a bit more history and knowledge of the local community, the original owners and the spirituality of Uluru. Do go if you have an opportunity."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is a must see - we were here as a part of a 30 day tour and this was a highlight visit - gotta see the sunset on it - Super
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Only by experiencing this magnificent rock can it be fully appreciated in all its glory. Whether it be at sunrise, during the day or at sunset it we were mesmorised with its magestic size and cultural significance."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru or Ayers Rock is a magical place, an artefact of Nature's creation still standing after millions of years being denuded by time and the forces of Nature. To the Aboriginal, it is a sacred site. Perhaps, and it had provided them a dream time reference. And whatever it means to them, its their definition that matters to them. For me, it is an awesome testament of the Universe's creation. For that I feel as one with it. I am also its creation. Uluru, a wonder of nature, sacred to the Aboriginals. And for me. It is a fantastic place full of mystery and wonder. Be here, be amazed, be a part of cosmic time. And if you have a chance, the Field of Light by Bruce Munro would enthral as you walk in the field of light. Too bad, this is only until the end of March next year. Be there! and you will not be disappointed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing place with lots of culture. The free guided Mala morning walk is very informative and the perfect length for people with young children and/or the elderly. Lots to see and do in the area. Thankfully climbing Uluru will be closed permanently next year, this can't happen soon enough. Climbing goes against the wishes of the Indigenous owners of the land (Anunga people) and is adding to the negative environmental impacts. If you want to see what the view is like from up there, nothing beats a helicopter flight at sunrise or sunset, STUNNING!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We came here a couple of times, first to do the base walk then to catch the sunset. The base walk took us around 3 hours to do and is very easy and flat. It was great seeing the different faces of Uluru and the different desert fauna. But I wouldn't call it enjoyable as it was very hot and there were lots of flies buzzing around. As we all know, Aussie flies are not civilised :) I highly recommend buying the head net that wraps around your face. This rock seems to change colour every direction you view it from. There are a few rest stops along the way, and even though there are two stops with safe drinking water, great for quenching the thirst but leaves a horrible after taste. Try to view at least one sunrise or sunset. We went for the sunset viewing and it was such an amazing experience, we had a rainbow sky with magnificent colours and you can see Uluru shimmering and seemingly changing colours as the sun sets."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Had Bruce on our tour of Ayers Rock. Very informative and quite spectacular. Watched the sunset drinking sparkling wine. Fabulous!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It has been one of our lifetime ambitions to see this natural spectacle. It was an amazing experience overall but there are some things to be aware of if planning a trip here. To see the rock a national park pass is required which costs 25 dollars per person and is valid for three days. You have the option of joining a tour (coach, mini bus, bike) or using your own vehicle or hire car to tour the park which includes Uluru, the Kata Tjuta range and the cultural centre which is close to Uluru. The tours are not cheap so if you are in the area for few days you will incur some high costs to join the tours or you will be restricted to your hotel/ campground (Assuming you are staying at the Ayers Rock resort area) from which the rock is not directly visible. We opted to join a tour for one day and hire a car for the remainder of our stay. It is also worth me mentioning the flies - they are not apparent in the photographs but will become a memorable part of the experience! We were disappointed in the cultural centre in the park. We felt it was too focused on the transfer of the land back to the original owners rather than the all- encompassing interpretation centre we were expecting."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What can I say? We saw it at sunrise. We saw it at sunset. And we cycled round it. It is truly amazing and you won't believe how amazing until you go and see it. The one thing that puzzles me is that the Aboriginals, who consider it holy, would prefer people not to climb on it yet the government allows it - seems to me to make a mockery of their professed wish to atone for earlier mistakes. Why don't they just close it to climbing?"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have always enjoyed my trips to Ayers Rock or Uluru as some prefer to call it. I had planned another trip in 2019 but have just read that it will be closed for tourists. You can no longer climb the rock which was one of the attractions. Taking this into account I think the resort will lose clients. It is expensive for overseas tourists to take a side trip to Ayers Rock, can cost up 10 1000 dollars. For that they will see the Rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Having had our large overseas family been too the Rock before, I will no longer take overseas relatives to Ayers Rock. This is because the local indigenous people have managed to have people banned from climbing the Rock delisted it being in a National Park. We will take our tourist dollar elsewhere and will never return. What an absolute shame is you have lost potentially thousands of dollars just from my family alone. I would suggest sticking to the East or West Coast if coming from abroad if you want to see the real Australia."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Have just had the privilege to visit Uluru & Kata Tjuta National Park what can I say they take your breathe away, the shear size of the rock formations, the amazing colours with the changing light, there is a special calming feeling you get being out at these areas. We went on a 6 hour tour saw the sunrise had breakfast were told of the dreaming the flora and fauna visited water hole saw rock painting THANK YOU TO THE ANANGU PEOPLE THE CARETAKERS OF THESE SITES FOR ALLOWING US TO VISIT"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ayers Rock is called Uluru by the Aboriginal people who serve as its caretakers We arrived at sunset and were able to watch the sun set over the rock as we drank wine, ate cheese, and ate apples. As the sun descended the rock seemed to glow eerily, as if it was lit from within. This painted the massive monolith into a kaleidoscope of colors. This is truly an exceptional site. However, it become a religious experience in the morning as a double rainbow appeared at sunrise. We were all awed as we walked near the base of the massive sandstone monolith. It is amazing to see the effects of millions of years of erosion by rain and wind."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This has to be the highlight of the trip. The rock is so big. Do all the walks around the base and read all the history. There are water holes and bird life. Do the walks early prior to 11am.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have live in Australia all my life and nothing prepared me for the sheer beauty of Uluru! You must see it at sunrise, go back at sunset, you must walk around it & walk up it if you can - its so worth seeing. I can't believe it took me so long to go. One of the best four days I have spent with my family."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I took the Hop On Hop Off bus from the resort to the first stop. There is a short walk to a watering hole. Stop to read the story boards! Once at the watering hole, I was lucky that no one else was there. I sat and enjoyed the beauty as well as the peace and quiet. I then had plenty of time before the bus next stopped here so I decided to walk to the next stop. This took very little time. I had beautiful views of Uluru. In some areas you cannot take photos because it is sacred. It is an easy walk but take plenty of water with you as it is hot and easy to get dehydrated."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow what a beauty!! Doesnt matter of you are visiting solo, in a group or tour. This is a must see attraction for anyone living or visiting Australia. Take in the glory of this beauty land and learn about the history of tbe aboriginal people"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Strongly recommend doing the base walk around the rock, gives you a much better feeling for the area than simply stopping at the car parks. The path is easy to follow and mostly level. Allow around 3 hours for the walk and go early if it's going to be warm, there isn't much shade. Don't forget water!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A good activity to do in the morning before it becomes too hot, mostly flat with shady spots and water stations was were very impressed with also seating to take a break. It was amazing to get up so close to Uluru. worth walking the next day after walking the Mala walk with the Ranger."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Awesome place to learn the culture. Very spiritual and uplifting. Amazing to see the rock. We Didn't hike up it as we felt it wasn't right for us too.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,AAT Kings is a tour company party excellence. Very professional guides and good comfortable vehicles. Excellent food arrangements. Don't have to think twice while signing up for a tour with them.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Stunning! The sights around Uluru are amazing, base walking took about 5 hours. The beauty of this monolithic rock can not be rushed. Kata Tjuta is stunning and does not seem to have as much exposure as Uluru. The spiritual and cultural benefits of visiting 'the Red Centre' is breath taking. As cliche as it sounds, it certainly is one for the bucket list. Only downfall : it is expensive."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"More than what I expected, so much more. It's just amazing. Nothing could prepare you for the sheer enormity of its presence. Both in colour, size and the spiritual feelings. It was so emotional. I had the joy of having flown over it the day before, that was incredible, though the see the rock from the ground, was another thing all together. So worth the travelling to get here."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is one of the most amazing places to visit, there are no words to explain how big this rock is without seeing it for yourself. It is just beautiful"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We stayed at the Sails in the Desert hotel which was above okay , the room comfortably air conditioned and the bathroom spacious. A minus was the pool area which was lacking in any shade and character . The area outside the pool could also be made easily a lot shadier and more comfortable too The breakfast was surprisingly expensive and a walk to the Town Centre for an alternative is recommended The various tours offered are well organised but are of variable quality. The outstanding for us was the base walk around the Rock and the walk at the Olgas. The food at the Sounds of Silence was not memorable. The night sky was, as usual, the winner. ."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Did a great tour with AAT Kings, had the fantastic Jess as our driver and guide. Jess was extremely informative and entertaining and really gave a great insight in to the history of Uluru and its traditional owners. Stopped at the Cultural Centre, then onto Kuninya Walk, Mutitjulu waterhole and to see some fabulous ancient Rock Art. Easy walking with a great explanation of everything we saw. Then onto the Sunset viewing area for drinks and nibbles while waiting for the sun to set over Uluru. Spectacular colours and amazing photo ops. Highly recommend. Thanks Jess!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ok...I finally got to see the Big Rock bka Ayers Rock AKA ULURU! Its ginormous and red and did I say ginormous?! The Aboriginal history and stories given by our guide was interesting but I sometimes wonder if a full day is necessary here? Is there a big hype for $ or is it really worth the hype? For me...it is definitely a place to visit, take in a little history and maybe even meditate. There is an energy about this place that silently whispers....history, peace, sacred grounds. I took a hundred pictures and you know what...they all look the same! And this was from different angles. So I quietly wondered if my visit was even worth it. Yes, but now that I've gone I personally don't ever have to go back. It's a huge rock in the middle of the Outback for goodness sakes! It's a Unesco World Heritage Site people!!! You MUST go see it if you happen to be in the Outback!! Also if you go...use SEIT Tours and ask for Emilee or Lachland! They are THE BEST GUIDES EVER!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A fantastic place and awe inspiring . Had a chance to visit in the rain. An awesome sight however unable to walk around.. one sunset was amazing
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Absolutely loved the rock, everything about it, the size, the colour, the walks, the climb, you really can't fathom the real size of this place with out experiencing it yourself in person. get out there and see it"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Absolutely breathtaking - you truly cannot appreciate the size of Uluru until you see it. We did the mala walk, and then the full base walk (with all short walks included), and were just fascinated the whole time. Watched sunrises & sunsets aswell, and it was just stunning the whole time. Really disappointing to see so many people still climbing Uluru though."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You really don't appreciate Uluru, till your driving up to it and visiting it in person. It really is beautiful. We did the 10+km walk around Uluru and loved every part of it. They've build water stations all around to combat the heat and the views and Uluru were beautiful all around."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We saw Uluru partially coved in cloud and also in brilliant sunshine. When we arrived at Ayers Rock resort there had already been a couple of ‘wet days’ and we were told that we were lucky to be there when it had been raining, apparently only 2% of visitors get this chance! We didn’t see the many waterfalls of the previous day but you could still see the rainfall leaching out of the rock. Having seen Uluru in all these moods from sunrise to sunset, in cloud and in sunshine was an awesome experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A long day but a great tour. Well organised, good drivers with light hearted but knowledgeable commentary. Customers looked after and everything provided. Barbecue well done even in the rain."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru and Kata Tjuta were breathtaking! You must pay for a three day pass when you arrive (so you might as well stay a few days). You also need a car, so make sure you secure one before you get there. I suggest you take a helicopter tour (including Lake Amadeus). The view is totally different from the sky. Do it! Kata Tjuta has an amazing hike. It will take you at least 4 hours and it's totally worth it. You will be amazed with the natural beauty of the Australian outback."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This place thrills everyone who visits it, there is a magical aura that never fails to delight. Highly recommend doing the circuit walk/ride to get a good appreciation of the rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We did two tours with AAT - one was a Sunrise over Uluru... the other sunset..... Must dos!!!! Valley of the Winds Tour - Day 2 - Sunrise at Uluru. .. and the magic of the Valley of the Winds at Kata Tjuta (Olgas)... one of the guides described Kata Tjuta as one of the unsung heroes compared with Uluru. ... I have to agree! Another early start but beautiful view of Uluru and Kata Tjuta as the sun rose made it worth it. AAT got us there early and in prime spot. Then off to Kata Tjuta for a tour of Valley of the Winds. AMAZING!!!! Truly spectacular. Worth it! Day 3 - Sunset and Uluru walk - Aboriginal cave paintings. .. Dreamtime stories and sunset at Uluru. .. loved seeing the changing colour of Uluru! Yes we're being tourists and loved every minute of it! !!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It was definitely a bucket-list place to see and did not disappoint. We went out for 2 sunset viewings and they were both fabulous. We also did a tour around the rock which was great - nice to hear about the history and formation of Uluru. We also bought a few pieces of art from the carpark of the coach viewing area where local indigenous artist come to sell their paintings - really well priced and we were very happy to see the money go straight into the hands of the artists. Highly recommend a visit to Uluru
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Definitely recommend getting up early and seeing the sunrise from the sunrise viewing area. Great views of sunset from there too as well as the designated sunset viewing area,getting this one early for a good spot. Great free walk at 10am which is an eye opener for aboriginal culture. Loved the cultural centre too. Recommend going to the Olga’s too!!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We decided to hire a car for 24 hours so we could visit the base of Uluru, Kata Tjuta and the Cultural Cente at our leisure. This enabled us to visit Kata Tjuta in the afternoon and the base of the rock the following morning. We were able to be part of the 10 am Base Walk Tour that the Cultural Centre runs. We also did a Sunset Viewing with AAT Kings which ws lovely."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It was more than worth it to catch a coach from Sails in the Desert at 5.30 in the morning to drive half way to Uluru for a delicious breakfast of damper, bacon and egg rolls, juice tea and coffee. We watched the sunrise from a dune and then drove to the Rock where our guide gave us plenty of time to explore on our own and then drove us around to the other side and walked us to the rock pool and to see rock painings. We also visited the Indigenous Museum. We booked this tour at the Visitor Centre at the Town Square and it was a small group of 12 in a 4 wheel drive vehicle. Definitely recommend it. We also took part in a dot painting class which was a lot of fun and very educational."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To see this striking rock formation, also known as Ayers Rock and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, we recommend renting a car and driving out for the afternoon sunset, which is absolutely gorgeous. If you have time, the Park information center has an excellent exhibit that will enrich your knowledge of the area, people, and history. We would not recommend skipping the information center, as it fills in so many gaps in one's knowledge of the area. We took one of the hikes which involved about 3 hours roundtrip of moderate walking, and really enjoyed it. As the trail was rocky, sturdy shoes are recommended. There were a number of other trails to take, but we didn't have enough time programmed. If you drive around the rock, you will still get a good sense of its beauty close-up and from different angles. There is a secondary formation which is also part of the park called Kata Tjuta, and we drove out there the next morning for the sunrise view. Honestly, we didn't find it nearly as spectacular as sunset at Ayers Rock, and it's quite a drive. Friends have asked if we thought making the effort to get to Ayers Rock was worth it, and our opinion it is, but it's not a place we personally would return to. The resort in the park is adequate, but the main draw is the rock itself, some of the activities such as camel rides, dot painting, etc. which are not only fun, but help new visitors better understand the history and culture of this barren area of Australia."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Its breathtaking, big, and amazing. Especially when you hear the legends as told by the guides. The colours at sunrise are brilliant."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The former Ayers Rock is always magnificent and now far too many tourists. This time, a unique experience in the rain, what different faces it presented. I was fortunate to stay where I had a room with a view of this wonderful structure, it is fascinating and very special"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I finally visited Uluru and it was more spiritual and magical than I ever imagined. Take a moment and reflect on all that came before. All the ceremony and rites that have happened in this place. Wondrous and incredible.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you travel to Australia coming from overseas this should absolutely be part of the program, watch sunset and sunrise here is really something special. The only negative fact is that the hotels are very expensive, too much"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is so much more than what i expected, it's amazing. Sunrises or sunsets are just breathtaking! You can discover about australian history and indiginous culture."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is the most spiritual and beautiful place I've ever visited in my life! We did an unguided walk, called the 'Base Walk', which is ca. 10km long. It was very warm but a few trees and fairly regular resting areas provided enough opportunities to cool down a bit. As there are plenty of signs with stories and explanations, we didn't feel like needing a guide. What upsets me is the behaviour of some people: some parts of Uluru are labelled as 'Sensitive Sites', with the request not to photograph them in respect of the cultural/religious importance for the indigenous people. Many tourists just ignored that, which is a pity. Take in this breathtaking view and keep it in you heart, not on your phone/camera! (Same is true for climbing the rock. Please show some respect!) You should take plenty of water, sunscreen and a hat. And yes, there are some annoying flies. If they bother you, take a fly net with you. There are animals and insects in nature, that is no reason to complain!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Having lived in Darwin for almost 30 years we decided to road trip it down to see the Rock. These days only a lucky few get to actually climb the Rock as it forms a very special part of the local Indigenous people’s culture. Please ensure you a very fit before attempting the climb, ensure you have shoes which have a thick rubber sole (as she gets pretty slippery) and 2 liters of water per person, a hat, sunscreen and I would also recommend leaving as soon as it opens at 8 am. It is 1.6 km up and back - a 3.2 km hike and it’s very very steep and you need to be quite agile to keep a stable footing. The views are amazing at the top! You can also walk around the base of the Rock which takes approximately 2.5 to 3 hours. Same rules apply - hat, sunscreen and water. Uluru is truly a sight to behold!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was likely my favorite activity in the area. Sunrise views were amazing, guide was knowledgeable and friendly, access to Uluru was fantastic. I underestimated the length of the walk, and how hot it would be by late morning. I'm a hiker and was really dragging by the end. Only other suggestion - the food provided was rather meager (quality, not volume). I'd rather pay another few bucks and have a small breakfast provided, and a lunch with a protein... Still, would do this trip again in a heartbeat"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The size of the rock really shocked me. The cultural center is good to visit. There are guided walks available.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was unsure if the rock could possibly live up to its reputation, but it certainly did. It's absolutely stunning and huge."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Images don't prepare you for the scale of the rock, like the pyramids of Egypt something you have to do once in your lifetime."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What can I say? I guess Uluru speaks for itself but I will say it is much more impressive than on those glossy photos. We did a lovely sunrise base walk with SEIT and would definitely recommend them for this activity. We chose not to climb for cultural reasons and did not feel like we missed any of the experience. So go on and book your tour!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Humble brag - From watching stars adjacent to the rock the first night, to seeing Sunrise the second morning, sunset that night and then sunrise from the Olgas viewing platform, you can not get enough of Uluru. Disgusted to see that people are still allowed to climb up, but delighted that not many people do. In fact, where the occasional person does climb up the prescribed path, there's a small nook at ground level, where I felt inclined to kneel as though feeling the heart of the heart of Australia - A very special moment, and one I wish more people would consider instead of wanting to clamber all over it! Actually, did the Skydive over the rock during the afternoon and couldn't recommend it highly enough - Expensive, but what a way to see Nature's finest cathedral. Great value for money, getting a 3 day pass. Great guides and wardens who kicked me out, on two separate occasions for being inside the park at night - But did so with such good humour, one had to smile! Highly recommend the Olga's platform for one dawn viewing if you can - Uluru sits due East of them, so the sunrise behind Uluru is astonishing"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Fantastic trip. Breathtaking seeing Uluru up close. It looks like it is photoshopped in real life. We rented a car but there seems to be heaps of buses.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We have all looked at images of Uluru on photos etc, but when you are physically standing at its base or walking around this massive structure, i'm sure you would describe it as awesome. This should be listed as one of the wonders of the world and is definitely worth the trip."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We indulged in a sunset helicopter ride that included Uluru and Kata Tjuta. It was magnificent, a true highlight experience that we will never forget. If you think you might enjoy it, don't hesitate."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru (or Ayers Rock) is breathtaking, and surreal. Be sure to see it in both daylight, sunset and sunrise. For Maximum effect, choose the vantage points to get that perfect angle. Do not climb the rock - this is sacred grounds for those who've lived here for 40,000 years."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You do not realise until you are right there the magnitude of this place...the multi facets of the rock bot in shape and colour are outstanding, and both sunrise and sunset need to be on your agenda..if you intend to ride by bike or walk around the rock (13kms) then start early at 8am"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"All I can say is ""go see it!"" It is such a special place. The trail around the base is beautiful at sunrise. Please don't climb the rock. It is a sacred place and people only belong on it during certain ceremonies. Respect the wishes of the Anangu."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This should definitely be on everyone's bucket list, once in a lifetime. Good from a distance but take advantage of the entry to the park to go up close to it- the sheer size is amazing"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Had a great time you have to at least do it once In your life time, we couldn't climb the rock on the day we were there, if it was open I probably would have climbed it but I didn't leave felling like I had missed something anything the place is amazing to just walk around."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is spectacular. Absolutely go and visit it and learn as much as you can about the Aboriginal land on which is sits/forms. But, please don't climb it. This is sacred land - like a church, or the pyramids or Mayan ruins. It is spiritual to our first people, so please show respect and don't climb it like a monkey."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Sunrise at Uluru was lovely especially with The Olgas in the background. The Resorts are pricey but I guess being in the middle of no-where this is to be expected, although were surprised at the reasonable prices at the IGA in Town Centre. The whole place is spotless and the rooms and facilities at Outback Pioneer were good value compared with some of the other places. Do book with the breakfast option though as prices at Bough House were ridiculous ($30 for CONTINENTAL and $36 for FULL but could be pre-purchased at Reception for $27). The rock itself is fascinating - we did the bike ride around the base and I have written a separate review for this. Everything runs like clock-work so a credit to Voyages. Only slight downside is 1 day passes aren't available for National Park and having to pay $25pp for a 3 day National Park Pass when only needed for the 1 day. Obviously this is not the fault of the Resort though. Excellent choice of Cafe's in Town Centre for meals if don't want to pay the ridiculous prices at the resort restaurants."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Despite all the reading and documentary redsearch, I had not realised the incredible complexity of this monolith and the history that lay within it. It is truly a spiritual place with a character defined and redefined as the sun rises and sets upon it. Beautiful!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We flew into Ayers Rock from Alice Springs and you can see the sheer size and impressiveness of this structure even from the sky. It is beautiful, unique and it feels very spiritual just being there. The walk around the base was great and informative. Coming from the UK it was definitely a massive tick off my bucket list."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Really worthwhile walking around. It took us 4 hours plus an hour with the Mala tour. The guides were excellent. Walking gave us time to see and take in Uluru from many positions. Take plenty of water for each person.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great to visit the cultural centre of Australia. We viewed it at in both sunset and sunrise from different vantage points, which are impressive for home photographers. We also completed the 10.6km base walk, which was great. Several signs to point out sacred areas of significance. Back of the rock was most spectacular, as a fit had recently been through, and there was lots of regrowth amongst the trees and shrubs. Some gorgeous wildflowers also."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Get there before 7am if you want to hike it. The wind & heat intensifies after 8:30am and authorities usually shut it down after that for safety. get a mesh hat if flies or bugs bother you as they are very aggresive most of the way up. Bring a couple bottles of water and GOOD grip footware.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This was on Bucket List and it didn't disappoint. Fantastic walk around with well informed sights and good pathways. Great photo opportunities.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is amazing, yes its very big and the walks around the base of it are fantastic, you can do small walks into the base from various car parks or you can walk the whole base which is about 10km around. there are some cultural sensitive areas where you are not permitted to take photos that are sign posted. you will need sensible shoes, sunscreen and lots of water and maybe some snacks. a parks pass is required to enter that lasts 3 days that you buy when entering the NP"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru (Ayers Rock) is a beautiful landmark in the Northern Territory of Australia. It's worth every kilometre to get there and see it in all its glory! We stayed for both sunset and sunrise and the sunet was definitely the best for us!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had a lovely time at this camp site and better when we found the camp kitchen, which is abundant in facilities. The shower and toilet block is lovely and clean and the showers hot. However people for some reason believed that the laundry sinks doubled for washing dishes???? The tent sites had grassed areas, which were great for tent pegs; up until this camp site trying to hammer tent pegs into hard red dirt was a little frustrating. This camp site was central to all site seeing areas and helpful people at the office to set us on our way."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I had never really been interesting in touring my own country, but no words can express the feeling you experience touring the middle of Australia, including the sunrise over Uluru. What an amazing journey. Great way to get a feel for the history of the Aboriginal people and meet locals and tourists alike in such a remote location."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Have seen it in thousands of images and films; have had it on our bucket list for years. Seeing it for real life is a totally different experience! Expensive trip, but worth every penny."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We did an AAT KIngs tour of both the sunrise and sunset with a BBQ dinner. The sunrise was wonderful although an early start with tea/coffee etc. and biscuits included. The sunset tour had a BBQ dinner under the stars and we were very fortunate to have an absolute clear sky. The dinner was excellent with a range of meats (including Kangaroo) cooked to perfection. Would highly recommend.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow, something one needs to include on their ""bucket list"". Overwhelming feeling just in the age and the relevant history involved. Have now visited the ""Rock"" twice over the past 7 years. Got the same ""buzz"" again."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is a BIG rock. You can't understand how impressive it really is until you walk around it (not up it).
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This iconic spot is a must see for all visitors to the Northern Territory. Magnificent at any time of day - well worth a visit. View it from Yulara village lookout or up close. Spectacular.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We were a large group and did a bus tour of the base of Uluru - our guide was very knowledgeable and shared much information about Uluru.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I went there on my own with a rental car, no tour guide, as a solo experience. I spent 3 days there, enjoying sunrises and sunsets, admiring the sacred rock during the day, looking at the stars during the night, learning about the culture. I loved it, it was really a special experience for me. Don't forget to walk around the rock and please do not climb it. Too bad they haven't forbidden climbing the rock yet, I guess tourist money comes before respecting aboriginal culture."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A fantastic and must see place if you visit Australia. The whole experience is well managed and extremely professional. The views, by day or by night are breathtaking, and the guided tours of the various sites are worth taking in. The site is a sympathetic and wonderful insight into the Aboriginal culture. We flew into Uluru and stayed for a few days, worth every penny!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I went to Uluru as part of a group Mulgas adventure tour in late April 2017 – and wow the rock form is amazing. First we went on the circular route around the rock, and being April the weather was lovely and balmy. It’s a nice walk with rest stops/huts along the way if you get too tired, I think some providers even offer cycling on the track. Bear in mind though, like with general travel in the central region, that you need to bring along at least two litres of water with you. There are signs around along the track which show the aspects of the uluru façade which you are not allowed to take images, due to cultural traditions. Also it was mentioned to not take any rock or fragments from the place – Apparently some other international tourists think it’s a good souvenir but not aware that it’s illegal and also that some have experienced ‘a curse effect’ when taking the rocks. So in short, photos only! Along the walk you being to see the many tones of the formation and in some parts of the rock, you can actually walk right next to and touch the rock formation. Its quite amazing. Nearby this area too theres a waterhole and Indigenous rock art – its on the walk way, which is a side trip inwards to the inner part of the rock, a 10 min diversion. The information centre complex is quite informative – Many buildings make up the centre – one with selling art, one with nature information and many more with different aspects of the Uluru area and indigenous culture. Bear in mind that the information centre grounds, photography is prohibited due to cultural aspects – the rangers on site and staff will notice – so don’t try! The information centre had limited handouts and some none at all – due to the volumes of tourists arriving. I found the Uluru app (which you can download) and also the uluru website better than the printed materials available at the centre. Also if you want a souvenir of the uluru rock, I realised afterwards that its cheaper and more variety in the actual Yulara township (the town centre of the uluru resort). The souvenir shop at the uluru information centre sold some gaudy foreign made souvenirs, but the local indigenous art and locally made products is highly recommended to buy here but. On a side note, near the main carpark is the controversial uluru rock climb chain – where some people decide to scale up the Uluru rock. I didn’t go up out of respect for the indigenous people but also because of the danger – you have to scale up by yourself about 1/6th of the way before you reach the metal chain, and the steepness of the rock, means some overly ambitious foreign tourists were crawling back down on all fours. It looked pretty dangerous and if you like a good view, I can recommend getting a window seat on your arrival or departure flight. Usually it’s the left hand side arriving and right hand side of the plane when departing which has the aspect of the rock. Overall the Uluru experience was amazing and can highly recommend making the venture!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great place :: the red centre with the ayers rock. Sandy desert. Will need pass to see the rock Aboriginal palce around Have access to the aboriginal museum Great shopping place at iga, dining at different places including longitude 131. Fields of light Lots more"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great morning walk around the base of Uluru, you don't need a guide but we had a great guide Tom from AAT Kings so you get a lot more information about it than just going by yourself. It's a beautiful way to start your day and the walk is not hard we met a 90 year old on the track and he was coping fine. Very interesting place. If you want to buy any thing that the local people make then the only place you can do this now is from the Culture centre at the rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"see by sunrise or sunset or just through the day - a not to be missed visit. lots of vantage points so doesn't have to cost a cent, you don't even need to be up close as it is impressive from 30Ks away."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went on the sunrise base walk run by AAT Kings. I was slightly apprehensive as I'm not very fit, however the tour information issued the day before reassured me that it would be possible to stop part way if preferred. As it happens the walk is on the flat throughout (although 12km in distance) and our visit being in winter meant that temperatures were fine for walking. You do need to take water with you, but we were supplied with a breakfast snack selection before we set off. At around the halfway mark the coach met us again to provide hot drinks, a water top up if required and another snack. It was at this point that you could drop out if you wanted to and go to the cultural centre. The guides, Tom and Stephen, were brilliant: good humoured, knowledgeable and attentive. Obviously in a group of 20 there will be some fast walkers and some much slower, but for the most part the group managed to stay together. Uluru is, of course, magical. Tom shared many of the stories associated with the rock and the beliefs and traditions of the local people. To stand beside the waterhole in the shade of trees, whilst gazing up at the towering walls of Uluru, will be a lasting memory. Feeling a huge sense of achievement we returned to the coach to be greeted by - cool towels! What an absolute delight, they were."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We decided to head to Uluru for a short break. Fabulous!! What an experience. Flew out with Jetstar. We booked with Voyages and stayed at The Desert Gardens Resort. We did most of the "" associated experiences"", including The Sounds of Silence Dinner, Field of Lights spectacular and even rode a camel with Uluru Camel Tours. On a lay day we hired a car and drove out to Uluru ( about 15 Klms) where we walked the base of the rock. I chose not to climb or really go anywhere near the rock. It's sacred ground to the local community and also, extremely dangerous. There's been 35+ fatalities in the past. #320m high!! A single span chain to hold on to! Forget it. Respect the local's wishes. I witnessed families with small children, elderly Asians with cheap slippery shoes and people of every fitness level head up the rock- just because they can! So dangerous- they need to fence it off. There's no safety chains on the way up there. The ""climbers"" are eroding the rock face. This is evident by the faded rock face under the chain. The rock face appears flaky and flimsy. The oxide had changed from orange to light grey. So there's a lot of people risking their necks! The Rangers advise that there's also a health issue evolving, as there's no toilets or garbage bins up on the top, so all the rubbish and human waste is washing down into the waterholes at the base. Stay off!! From there we drove 53klms to Kata Tjuta ( The Olgas). Remarkable!! The most beautiful landscape you will ever see. The Red Centre- You have to do it! Fabulous for a short break. Will return."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One of the remaining landmarks to visit in my home country was ""Ayers Rock"" (Uluru). We landed at Uluru mid afternoon and the view from the plane showed the enormity of this specular landmark in the centre of Australia. We spent a day traveling around Ayers Rock and investigating different areas. We also joined a free tour by a Ranger that explained the connection between Uluru and the traditional owners - Anangu - very informative tour (2 hours). Ayers Rock - truly one of the most astonishing land formations on earth! You can climb the rock but out of respect for the Anangu we chose not to climb."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To see it in a photo is one thing, but to be there in ""real life"" and walk around it, is another!!! I never imagined this ""rock"" would move my emotions the way it did, it is breathtaking!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We took a Sunset tour with SEIT and it was worth every penny. A superb guide (Nadine I think) and a glass or two of bubbly with nibbles as the sun set on Uluru.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What an amazing visit to Uluru. Viewing these huge rocks sticking out of the ground in an otherwise flat arid land. You must stay to view the rock at sunset. Awesome how the rock changes colors before going dark.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Kata Tjuta National Park is a beautifully spiritual place. Walk, look, think, respect and take it all in. Photos do not do it justice. It is remote and the harshness has me amazed that the incredible indigenous custodians have resided there for 450,000 or more years. There are many tourists who are mostly respectful. Take a tour and take your time."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"the Uluru climb was ""closed for cultural reasons"" for over a week, with little to no explanation, and confusion as to when it would be open again, leading to a lot of disappointment. are also large areas of the rock that prohibit the use of cameras/taking photos. People riding bikes arround the rock were largely inconsiderate, and constantly forcing people who were walking to move off the track to allow them to pass. signage re distance etc for walks were very lacking and uninformative."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is best viewed from different aspects and at different times throughout the day. If you want to view the sunrise or the sunset, then you need to arrive early to get a decent spot. Walking around the rock is best done in an anti-clockwise direction as it affords the best views (just watch out for the bikes and segways). There are not a lot of other walkers so you are able to take in the intricacies of the rock. It is up to you to choose whether you climb the rock or not. Please consider the beliefs of the Aboriginal people."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ok the Rock is great to experience but what is lacking is the entire education and cultural experience that Northern Australia does so well. We did a couple of tours and felt that the information given lacked detail and interest. Seriously, do we want to hear the Indigenous name for everything the guide talked about? And that's not said with disrespect but we will never remember them, but we will remember stories of life for Indigenous Australians, herbal medicines, food, etc. Another problem is that it is stated the park shuts at 7.30pm. Well of course it can't as the main road to WA goes straight through it. But being law abiding people we respected that, but it means that the astral photography that we wanted to do was cut short. Very frustrating."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I loved uluru and my walk around the base. It was an awesome and inspiring experience. There is a song by aussie singer John Williamson that sings a song ""it's raining on the rock"" and he says ""uluru has power"" and having now been there I agree. Do it and walk around the base, I am 70 and overweight, I did the 10.5 km walk and so can you."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,If you're in central Australia then chances are youre going to go to Uluru. Make sure you see the Olga's while you're there. FYI Uluru is about a 5 hour drive from Alice springs.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Our trip was based on visiting this amazing piece of Australia. It is enormous and fantastic. We hired segways to ride around the Uluru. It was great. The different colours of Uluru are amazing. You must not come to the NT and not see Uluru and The Olgas.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Wether it was the dawn or sunset the Rock is magnificent. This formation is great for very fit people or others who just wan to stare in wonder. I was staggered by the beauty and natural wonder that is Uluru
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Loved seeing the rock , pictures don't do it justice. Amazing sit to see and a must for all Australians."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We have just done 2 nights in Uluru staying at the Outback Pioneer. Whilst Uluru itself was magical, we completely agree that the resort makes the most of having a captive audience. If you are planning on going, don't fall for the ' you don't need a hire car as there's a free shuttle bus' routine, get yourself a car. It's well worth it and will work out cheaper than even one trip to see the Rock. Best tips we had was ignore the suggested sunrise area and go to the sunset one. Although you can't see the Rock changing colour, you get to see the sun come up next to the Rock. It was amazing. People we spoke to who did the official sunrise area we're disappointed as it was crowded and the Rock seemed in shadow most of the time. After sunrise we went to check out the bike hire- expensive but great fun, and found a BBQ site next to the Cultural centre. We had been really disappointed 're the bbqs facilities at Out back as we choose that accommodation as it advertised bbq facilities. What they didn't tell you was that you could only cook the stuff they supplied at greatly inflated prices. $102 ASD/ £60 for 2 chicken breasbreasts, 3 sausages and 1 steak plus salad made it one of the most expensive meals we've had in Oz!! When the enquired how much the bbqs we're, the rangers looked at us as if we were mad and said they were free - just leave them clean for the next person!!! This was the BEST thing ever. We had the place to ourselves, apart from a lone dingo and the view of the rock was amazing. It was the most magical evening ever. As we drove out we saw one of tge package dinner at sunset cpaches set up on the other side and we would have had to pay £600 for all of us to do that - instead of our $30 self as cooked feast!!! We went back with a donation the next day and almost had to fight to give it to the rangers!! So completely different to the resort who ask for a donation on check out! It's not listed it advertised anywhere but certainly worth know I g about."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a must see on any visit to the NT if you haven't been before! To truly experience the rock and the landscape surrounding I would recommend to complete the 10km base walk, taking in all angles of this monolith in the desert. It is surprising up close to see the subtle differences across different sections of the rock and also the changing vegetation. Sunset viewing was ok, good atmosphere and attracts a lot of viewers so arrive early!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is the place to go if u truly want to have a Great outdoor experience. There are different trails for all levels of hikers & campers, from Uluru Base walk to Kantju Gorge trail. The Sunrise trip to see Uluru is a must & its worth waking up 3:30am in the morning. However, the Hotels including the SAIL are quite basic despite their hefty price tags, & all the Aborigines Paintings for Sale @ the Tourist Center are forbiddingly expensive. So save your money on basic lodging & aim to spend more time in outdoor activities instead."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I f you haven't already Uluru is a must. Walk around it ride around it take a walk with the ranger and learn about the history, the people just sit and be inspired by the size and its beauty."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It was a very very nice spot and you have to come once in your lifetime. Uluru's landscape was so spectacular which you will never forget her. We came here from a road trip from Alice Spring - when we arrived Uluru, we viewed several times of sunrise and sunset - as well as the star sky. It was really unforgettable!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru was simply incredible. it was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced. We camped at the Ayers Rock campgrounds. After setting up we went for a drive into the national park to see Uluru. It was the most amazing experience, it is truly incredible. There is only little trees and shrubs on flat plains and then BAM there is this huge Red rock. Just amazing how there isn't anything around it. That evening we watched the sunset on Uluru, so beautiful. As the sun slowly sets the colours change from a natural red to a bright orange and the to a nice brown. Just incredible experience!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So pleased to have finally been there. A long drive from Alice but great if yiu like wide open spaces like I do. We refuelled at Erldunda going out and Curtin Springs going back. Both worth a quick stop. Obviously the light at sunset and sunrise is a day by day proposition but we thought it was worth it. It's time they stopped the climb. The 2hr free Mala tour every day by the rangers is a must do as is a circumnavigation by foot, bike or (like us) segway. Such a unique place. Well-managed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is a review of the Uluru Base Walk (rather than Uluru generally). Of the three walks we did while at Uluru (other others being the Kings Canyon Rim walk and the Olgas Valley of the Winds walk), the Uluru Base Walk was the least impressive. It is incredibly impressive being so close to Uluru, however once you get used to that, the rest of the walk is quite mundane. A large portion of the walk (the first half) is far away from the base of Uluru, and largely unshaded. I did enjoy the variety of bush flowers along the track. In my view, the best part of the walk is between the Mala carpark and the Kuniya carpark (the Lungkata walk). It's close to the base of Uluru, and you are surrounded by beautiful gum trees and birds. If you aren't sure whether you want to do the full Uluru Base walk, I'd recommend completing just this section. The walk is between 10-11 km, and took us 2 1/2 hours to complete. This included a fair amount of photo time, and a detour to Kantju Gorge. We started at a moderate pace, but by the end we were a bit tired (and needed to get back to Ayers Rock Resort to make our scenic flight), so quickened up the pace for the last section. The walk is flat and not difficult. The most difficult part of the walk is the fact that it is largely unshaded (so you're walking in the sun for a long period of time). Joggers or other walking shoes are fine."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did the trick around the base. It gives a different perspective than from a distance. Seit tours did a great job, I would recommend them. The only problem would be it went over by an hour and a half. Just allow for it"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing and mysterious place to visit ,the lookout area for sunrise and sunset is a must love seeing people on roofs of cars and sitting with a wine or two"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My partners family decided to have a get together at Uluru/Yulara. Her niece, who has recently started a job as a travel agent, organised us all to meet up in Sydney then fly in. We normally do our own thing rather than tours but the excellent, and culturally sensitive and aware guides with AATKings and Seit are worth paying for especially as this is something that you will probably only do once in your life. We spent 3 whole days at the resort and on the last day 3 of us decided to do our own thing. We managed to hire the last available car in town (the woman at Hertz said if you stand on the roof it is a $1500 fine; I wondered why you would want to stand on the roof?). It was school holidays and the place was absolutely heaving. Camping ground overflowing, hotels full, queues for dinner and the local supermarket looked like the end of the worlders had been through it. We intended visiting the Cultural Centre which was great. Sure it is touristy but not in a tacky way and in the background it seems to be a bit of a drop in centre for the Anangu people. We watched a demo on how to make glue from a species of Acacia and it was good to watch the involvement of younger tribe members in the presentation. We then decided to drive around Uluru which actually gives you a slightly different perspective to walking around it as the road is further back. We then headed off to Kata Tjula to do the valley of the winds walk as a number of locals had told us it was their favourite place. You can walk a whole circuit but as it was getting latter in the afternoon we only went to the second lookout, about 5km return, which has fantastic views. On the way back we headed back to Uluru for the sunset and in the overfilled car park watched every third vehicle with people standing on the roof! The sunset up close was amazing probably better than the sunrise."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Had an occasion to visit Uluru on our trip. We were there one night at sunset and again the following morning for the sunrise. While it appears in photos as nothing more than a large monolith in the middle of the desert, it is much more than that. Uluru is a very special place on this grand globe of ours. Anyone who makes a trip to «the land down-under» is doing themselves a disservice if they do not visit this very special place"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wonderful visit. First time was an early morning 5 am tour(has to be early as it's sooooo hot). Loved it - interesting and filled with history and legends. The second visit was a late evening meal under canvas with music and various foods to try such as crocodile, kangaroo etc. Would definitely recommend a visit - I think its the best part of OZ"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru colour changes with the time of the day. With its rainbow sky backdrop sometimes, the view is so stunning :)) I suggest don""t climb up the uluru because it is a sacred place to the aboriginal people. There are many ways to enjoy Uluru""s view, like camel riding. To me, Uluru is a must-go place in life."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Sometimes trip advisor's minimum word count serves to detract from natural wonders that could be easily summed up with single words. Breathtaking. Stunning. Beautiful. Would all be suitable to describe Uluru.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Show respect for this amazing place. The aborigines don't recommend you climb on it. Those who do look like ants and frankly, it's better just looking at. The size is awe-inspiring - and that's apparently only the small part of it that we can see! Dodge the noisy and embarassing tourists who can't stip talking and drinking long enough to 'feel' the place. Aboriginal art is available to buy from local people if you go at sunset. Cheaper than at the shops - and more meaningful as an experience and in terms of supporting the indigenous communities."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Was well worth the trip. We cycled around with our own bikes and did the cultural walk with Rangers. Stayed at caravan park was fine, but busy. When you go to sunset viewing take some drinks and nibbles, but get there early for a good spot"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What a magnificent place this is. I never get tired at looking at this beautiful landscape. The colours are just amazing. There is something very special about this place and its people. I will be back.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had the privilege of visiting Uluru in July for 4 nights. We flew direct to Uluru from Sydney. We found the entire experience wonderful and extremely special. Our kids are 8 and 6 years and they loved it and got so much out of the tours. Highly recommend if you can. If I had my time again, we would have stayed 5 nights and paced our tours a bit more."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was more than we expected, so glad we went, so amazed at the size of The Rock, rode our pushies around it, was awesome, loved, loved, loved it!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This rock is way bigger then it seems in the pictures. It is a super long walk around the rock and you can even hike up on top if it is not to windy. We had people tell us that the rock is actually much larger but the rest of it is all underground. This place was definitely worth the 4 hour each way drive from Alice Springs and if you get the chance to go here definitely take it.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Such a beautiful location, climbed the rock first thing in the morning before the wind and day got too hot. Then rode around the base just because we could. Had our own mountain bikes so can't help with bike hire details. Have been here many times and never tire of how big and awesome the rock is."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You've got to go once in a lifetime. The base walk around Uluru is amazing and filled with little natural surprises. There are no bathrooms so hit the Cultural center on your way in. It took us 3 hrs of fairly slow walking. The cool morning meant no flies. I was appalled at the people who opted to climb it despite local pleas not to. The sunset and sunrise views are best with a little distance but the viewing areas have plenty of parking for peaceful viewing and photos.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a magical place and as a parent I took the opportunity to teach my teenage son about respect by not climbing the sacred rock. But sadly the number of bogans who climb with blatant disregard for indigenous culture made it difficult to emphasis this valuable life lesson. Very disappointing . We instead trekked the base walk, attended the Mala walk and took a helicopter ride around the famous front side, by the time we had achieved all the above we were satisfied we had made the most of the expensive"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was the highlight of a trip-of-a-lifetime to Australia. Yes, it takes forever to get there, but part of what made Uluru so magical to me was its appearance in the middle of nowhere after a six-hour bus ride from Alice Springs. Photos can't do justice to its immensity and the stark contrast it provides to the landscape around it. But it only got better as we approached Uluru, and explored its crooks and crannies as we walked around it. My only regret is that we did not have enough time to hike the entire way around it. It was amazing to see it for myself. We also saw it at sunset and got up early the next morning to catch it at sunrise. The colors and the shadows changed constantly as the sun descended in the evening and rose in the morning. The only drawback, and it's a minor one, was the crowds of people jockeying for position for photos."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Travelling around Australia and so looking forward to visiting Uluru or Ayers Rock visited the cultural centre very disappointed but that's another review. Staying at the Ayers Rock Resort and along with about 50 other 4 wheel drives headed off to the Uluru sunset viewing area. Got there found a spot pulled a chair up opened a cold one and waited for sun to go down. What a great atmosphere and certainly a lovely site as the evening closed in, well worth viewing if in this location."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is just incredible! Changing colour continuously. Great to visit at different times of the day. With recent rains we were treated to water trickling down the rock, waterholes and lots of green vegetation!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The first sighting of Uluru is like stepping into an oil painting. It appears so unreal our first thoughts were that someone had photo shopped it into the landscape! What an amazing part of Australia. There are plenty of options to walk, ride or drive to various highlights.... waterholes, significant caves etc.... most of it well signposted and informative. It is important to be aware that there are several sensitive areas of the rock that you are asked not to photograph out of respect. These are clearly signposted. As for climbing the rock.... still allowed but is not easy. I am reasonably fit but did not have the strength to crawl up the last 20 metres to the chain link fence. Overall, just an incredible experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This guided tour was excellent and I would recommend it for anyone interested in Uluru. Although the walking path is flat, it is important to be prepared by wearing sensible walking shoes and having water with you as it covers a distance of 11km. It is a walk that takes in all sides of Uluru and, although it was an overcast morning, the views were still spectacular. The small group started the base walk at the Kuniya Piti drop-off point. During the walk, our Macca, our guide, explained about the geological formation of Uluru, the flora and fauna we were seeing and as well as its significance to the Anangu people. We stopped at different stages so he could explain about things we were seeing and to direct our attention to many of the significant sights around Uluru, as well as pointing out particular highlights for photographs. Macca was informative and passionate about assisting us to understand the stories and the history of Uluru. Halfway through the walk we met up with our coach. The drivers were ready for us as we had a break for a hot drink. Each of us was given a breakfast bag that offered a good mix of foods and plenty for satisfying the appetite. We commenced the second part of the walk taking in the Lungkata and the Kuniya walks and the beautiful Mutitjulu Waterhole. It seemed that in no time we were back at our starting point with our coach ready and waiting to take us back to our accommodations. The lovely lemongrass scented towels offered to us were a lovely touch and a welcome and refreshing way to complete our walk. This is a great way to seek Uluru and I went back to several sections and re-walked them with a better understanding. This is an interesting experience. It gives you time to really appreciate Uluru and I highly recommend it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,If you visit Uluru make sure that you take the free guided walk that leaves at 10am from the base of the rock. Listening to the fascinating insights about traditional indigenous culture provided an excellent framework of appreciation for the significance of Uluru from one of the traditional owners. Our guide patiently answered a myriad of questions. he was informative and humorous. The walk and talk takes one and a half hours and you certainly learn a great deal in that time. Make it one of the first things that you do when you arrive so that you can think about all the things you have heard while you are enjoying the other activities on offer.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We didn't book on a guided tour just booked the bus pick up and drop off from our hotel Sails In The Desert which went smoothly. It took as two and a half hours to walk around the very scenic walk around the base of the rock. Hot, thirsty work but well worth it for great photos. Take enough water! There are some notices around a few points of the walk requesting that you refrain from taking photos and you should respect that request as there are plenty of photo opportunities to be had. At the main car park there is a chain up the steep face of the rock where we did see people climbing. However, it looks to be very hazardous and I understand that several people have died after falling on this steep climb. There are some plaques on the rock indicating as much. People can make their own decisions on what they do but make sure it is an informed one!!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Did the base walk like everyone else. Took about 4 hours to do and we all enjoyed it a lot. Did not do the climb out of tiredness, a great day out though and the sign posts along the walk were informative."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Awesome, fantastic, informative, fun, exciting, interesting.... while family loved it!! We learnt a great deal about our solar system... from dream time to Current day facts. A wonderful experience"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We booked with AAT Kings to go to the Uluru sunrise and Kata Tjuta tour and our guide and driver Stephen gave us an experience that we will never forget. Whilst the cloud cover on the day didn't allow a full array of colours to light up Uluru the sheer experience of waiting patiently for the sun to rise over such a special sacred site was memorable. The Kata Tjuta tour was no less spectacular with a walk through the Walpa Gorge with stunning views of the mountainous scenery completely surrounding us as we walked up and through the massive rock formations. We would definitely recommend everyone to do this tour.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"An impressive sight in every way and a true sight to see at least once in your life. Worth every coin going there. But plan ahead and study maps and walks before coming since the rock looks very different from time to time during the day. If there are even the smallest amount of clouds at sunset, you might want to plan for something different than standing on the normal sunset spot. In the case of cloudiness, I would recommend going for an opposite view and go to the sunrise spot instead to catch the rock against the red clouds and Kata Tjuta in the background. This is of course if you have time the next day for another try. If you go for the normal sunset sight, go there early since you’ll not be the only one with that idea. Many spots are partly blocked by trees and bushes so the first area is the best if you ask me. Also, the one that is occupied first. AS for sunrise, it is about 25 min drive from Yulara with another 10 min to walk to the platform. There will be trees in the way. Also, study the map again since depending on where the sun goes up, the rock will light up differently. In July the sun rises at Northeast which lights up mainly the north side of the rock. The platform is located to the south-east, so you will mostly see the shadow side of the rock. In summer, this is different."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A visit to Uluru really is special. My daughter and I went on a three day tour that allowed us to see the sunset and sunrise on this monumental rock as well as walk around its vast base and learn something of its cultural importance to the Aboriginal people of the area. I was surprised by the amount and variety of vegetation and the micro climates created by the water runoff and protection from the harsh sun in some spots. Allow a good three hours or more to walk around and enjoy the spectacle.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Just a Must see!once in your life Every Aussie has to see to believe! Long way but worth the effort 🐪🐪🐪
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For sure one of the best experiences ever! Be aware of the spirituality of the place and the flies! Buy the net, don't hesitate! If you stay in the region even if it's only for a few days, will be more then needed!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a spiritual journey! I waited almost ten years to do this trip & feeling so blessed to tick it off my bucket list. A 'must do' experience imo. I'm still in awe of the experience. My husband first said ""it's just a big, giant rock"" but so embraced the cultural/spiritual experience that he did the ""Malaysia Walk"" twice"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Breathtaking! The kids aged 9 /11 throughly enjoyed the experience on going on such a beautiful adventure. Highly recommended as a family generating memory.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I never thought a rock could have such an impact on me... but it has a presence, you FEEL something there... I can understand why it has such a spiritual importance for Aborigenes people... it is a must see."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We woke up early to see the sunrise. Tip: Don't follow the hoards to the viewing platform. The view is MUCH better on the walking path and you can walk right up to the rope and capture amazing photos while getting to enjoy some semi-solitude. In the distance you can also see The Olgas. It's quite something to see the sun come up and start reflecting off the plant life and then the rock itself. My boyfriend then climbed Uluru. I tried, but had a near meltdown at the small section before the rope (this is quite common as I sat near that spot for 2 hours and watched many people struggle with the same spot). Lots of people sliding down on their bottoms have polished that portion of the rocks, but my boyfriend told me that once you get to the ropes, the rock is much easier to walk on and that you can feel safe doing so. Great experience to the Outback!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Absolutely breathtaking to see at sunset the colours are amazing but extremely busy at this time of year we did some of the shorter walks really good.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru (Ayers Rock) is situated basically in the centre of Australia so is in a very remote location. The area has many massive sandstone outcrops of various names eg Ayers Rock, Olgas etc. These outcrops are absolutely stunning in the best lighting conditions, typically sunrise and sunset. Just the sheer size and form of these outcrops is stunning. The Ayers Rock village is the closest facility to Uluru and offers a variety of accommodation levels from camping to 5 star resort style. The are also a variety of independent tour operators who offer everything from camping style tours of the area to luxury coach style tours, take your pick. AAT Kings is the biggest operator and offers ""up market"" tours including the sunrise and sunset tours and dinners as a complete package including drinks and meals. The major airlines offer good daily connections to all Australian cities and the hotels provide free airport transfers. If you are considering driving check the distances because it is a long way from anywhere! Due to its remote location Uluru is not cheap, expect to pay at least double city prices so if you are on a tight budget plan ahead and check prices for accommodation etc. The best time to visit is late autumn, winter, early spring. If you are flying or driving suggest you definitely avoid summer due to the high temperatures in outback Australia and that some of the walks are closed if temperatures are expected to be above 36 Centigrade. Definitely recommend a trip to Ayers Rock!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When you visit these world renown landmarks you just hope you won't be disappointed....and I wasn't. The sheer size and majesty of this 'Rock' was something to behold. The ability to climb it or simply walk/ride/segway around it provides options for all to experience this place. We discovered water holes, rock paintings and various flora on our explore. What a place to visit !!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is what we came out to the beautiful red centre to see, it is amazing, and even more amazing is the knowledge we gained. The rock is sacred to the indigenous people and their culture and they do not want people climbing Uluru, yet we saw many who disregarding their wish, i don't know if they were not informed on the reasons why, or whether they just don't care, i think the later as there is signs in full view as to why not to climb. It would be awesome for people to respect their wish, this is part of their culture and sacred to them. There is no need to climb the rock, the sight and the walk, the whole environment is a priceless experience on it's own."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It was awe-inspiring to stand right next to this in real life. I'd recommend a guide or go in a tour to enhance the experience, there's a lot to learn."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"someone said its just a rock, maybe it is, but oh that someone has really missed a moment to reflect on the importance of this iconic landmark. the colours of the rock face as the sun sets are truly magical, but in the morning at dawn, its even more spectacular, its worth getting up at 4am to experience this for yourself, get your cameras ready stand on the viewing platform and be overwhelmed but the stillness peace and tranquillity. have to agree with countless other here on TA that a photo does not do this place justice"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a wonderful bucket list experience. We went on the mala tour with knowledgeable ranger, James, and enjoyed hearing of the indigenous history around uluru. This free tour is a must for all those who visit the area. 10am each day."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Unforgettable. Such a magical place. Highly highly recommend anyone to visit Uluru. The views are unexplainable. No photo will ever do it justice.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We spent a couple of days coming to and from this amazing monolith. It really does majestically rise out of the desert. We even saw it covered in mist and with rain and a few waterfalls. We did not climb the rock, and felt very happy just walking the base walk, taking it in from all aspects. A lovely, gentle 10km walk."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Money well spent on this holiday. We hired a car which I would recommend. Free Mala walk was interesting. We did the base walk starting predawn and enjoyed sunset from one of the viewing areas. There are good viewing areas within the resort which are worth visiting for sunset viewing too. It is disheartening to see visitors opting to climb Uluru disregarding cultural significance and environmental impact. However when we were there climbers were less than 15% visitors I would say, which is better."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru and Kata Tjuta are beautiful natural wonders in the big red center of Australia. We were in awe of the majesty of this two mountains. We had a guide that explained how the traditional aboriginal people lived on this sacred land, which added to the significance of this location."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Rock, Ayers Rock, Uluru - whatever you want to call it, this sacred and special area is one that requires not just your physical presence and ability to walk around it, but it requires your open mindedness to the spirituality that comes with this most iconic area of Australian and aboriginal history. Let any tour or self guided exploration of your own take you down the road of exuberance, of natural beauty, and of great respect for this most special location on Australian land. Just make the visit, just take in the atmosphere, just get there.."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"How good is this place. Sad we didn't visit earlier in our life. The entry fee is good value for money and we made the most of our time here with a sunset viewing, visit to the cultural centre and 2 rock base walks. Will be back again."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing place, awesome huge rocks. The red center is red red and a bit brown when raining. If you want the sun effects, the sunrise is better. Don't wait to see the sunset. You will be disappointed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The view, the air, the history, just one word would describe it, good tour organized throughout the day. People are there to help. True Ozzie spirit"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We took a Hop-on-Hop-Off bus to Uluru. This was 49pp. We reached Mala walk in time for the Park Ranger guided walk. The Aboriginal elder gave us a deep understanding of ancient Anangu culture and at some points I was brought to tears. This ancient civilization has not received the respect it deserves. Australian school history books need to be re-written. We are NOT young and free! We are older than the well known ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. After the guided walk we walked 2km along a lovely dirt path to the Cultural Centre. We got our Hop on/off bus from there back to the resort. We did the Kata Djuta sunset tour that afternoon. It was the best! If you ever go to Uluru DO NOT miss this. The next morning we took a Uluru Sunrise Tour run by AATKings. This was $69. Sunrise on the rock was lovely. After Sunrise we were driven around the rock and made a stop for photos before being driven to our resort for our buffet breakfast at Desert Gardens. After that we had the rest of the day to chat with the CAASTRA astronomer at Town Square and to listen to the Bush Tucker presentation by LEON. A visit to the museum is recommended with a 2pm presentation by the astronomer. A quick nap followed by Sounds of Silence dinner made for one fabulous day at Uluru! Pictur I touched the same rock on which Anangu women ground seeds for damper 36000 years ago!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What a privilege to visit Uluru. It's truly stunning. Every Australian should visit at least once. The sunset is spectacular. Our thanks to the local Anangu people for sharing their stories and special places with us.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I honestly thought it wouldn't be as good as everyone hypes it up to be, but it is truly magnificent. Uluru is amazing the changing colours of the rock throughout different times of the day are stunning. We did the base walk with the 3 kids which they all enjoyed can also hire bikes to ride around it too. Viewing it at sunset is a must too. The only small negative I had was there didn't seem to be any info on the geological formation of the area (unless I missed it)!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our first look at Uluru was from the plane. On closer inspection, Uluru is so huge and amazing. The ranger talk was a bit too long for us, so we set off on our own to discover how amazing this rock is. Viewed from all angles, its simply beyond words and the camera to capture the majesty of the structure. You have to be there to appreciate Uluru. Sunrise and sunsets are so spectacular. Very very awe inspiring. An experience not to be missed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Visit in winter time as the sky will be blue and not too hot during the day. Drive around the base and visit Mala Walk and waterhole. Don't miss sunset at the car park sunset area.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No visit to Australia is complete without a visit to Uluru, and every Australian would benefit from a visit! majestic and powerful, beautiful and ever changing."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a bucket list item for a lot of travelers, it certainly was for us. The rock is stunning and the sites in the rock...men's caves, women's caves, etc. interesting and mysterious. I wouldn't bother going with a guide; you can't get lost and the sites are well posted."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Super expensive, too hot and too many flies! However,it was quite interesting to visit the holiest site for the Aborigens"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is must if you are travelling to Australia or even live here. There is a beautiful feeling to this place, it is just amazing. Everyone Australian should visit Uluru, it is a really great experience. Although lots of people ignore it be careful where you take photos as there are some areas that are considered sacred and can not be photographed, but these are signed. Truly worth the travell."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You have to see it. But you will pay a premium. Water is $4 a liter. The shuttle from Ayer's Rock resort to the Nat Park is $49/person. Food is pricey and not great and there's a lot of annoying flies. Uluru, however, is amazing and a once in a lifetime. Once. If you're budget travelers like us, put on your sunscreen and spend the money for a fly net 2/$15. get on the hop on hop off bus where you pay $25 for a park pass, good for three days. Try to get there before nine am and quickly tour the cultural center. It doesn't take long. And it's not very interactive, with mostly photos and information boards and a few artifacts. Get back on the bus and go to Mala walk for the free interpretive walk at 10 am. The Rangers are interesting and give lots of info about the original residents and how they lived. The walk takes about an hour and a half, not rigorous, and then you will walk back at your leisure. That will be put you at lunch time. We packed sandwiches and filled up our water bottles at the little picnic area with toilets across from the parking area. Then decide if you still had energy for a longer walk to one of the bus pick up locations. Spend the money to do a Sounds of Silence Dinner. That's worth it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Second site to visit after cultural centre. If not pressed for time there are a few activities to become involved in. Walks, bike rides, or just drive around to take some happy snaps. You can notice the change in temperature when taking the walking tracks closer to the rock face and near the spring."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We spent five nights in Yulara, and rented a car so that we could visit the national park at ease, several times per day, and get around to different points of interest. You have to pay an admission fee to the national park. We payed for three days and got a two day extension free if charge. Strongly recommend visiting the Anangu Cultural Center BEFORE you walk around the cliff. There are free tours, where a ranger will walk with you and tell you about the traditions and myths surrounding this place. With some of this backgound info, you will appreciate what you see much more and gain a deeper understanding. Some even have a spiritual experience in the presence of the unique rock or monolith! And PLEASE respect the traditions of the Anangu, and don't climb the cliff!! Stroll around, absorb the atmosphere. Some parts of the cliff should not be photographed - please respect that! If you are there in the hot season, drink lots of water and wear a hat! The flies can be disturbing, many wear flynets over their heads."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Cannot believe it took me so many years to visit Uluru. It is the most beautiful, scenic and spiritual place. The only downside is the 30% of tourists (mainly Australian) that still go there to climb Uluru despite the traditional owners requesting that you do not."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is certainly a must visit place if you're in Australia. It certainly was a magnificent experience to be up close at this UNESCO site of 600 millions years stone monolith. You have to be here to experience the sheer magnitude, size and beauty of changing colours according to sun ray - from light orange, brown, dark chocolate to brilliant red. As one walks along the base rim of the rock, you can see and feel what the Anangu people experienced here - crevices, gorges, some paintings. Several tours such as sunset, sunrise, dinners and drinks, camel rides, guided walk etc are available, but do book in advance as they can be fully booked upon arrival. The national park ticket entrance cost 25 dollars but valid for 3 days and there is also shuttle bus available to drop you at the park. The base walk is about 9.4 km walk and flat ground. For those who do not want to walk, you can also opt for Segway tours. Hat and face net is a must to avoid desert fly - they are harmless but can be annoying. It is sacred for the natives, so please if you can avoid it, do not climb up the stone - not everything has to be feat. Very glad I made it to this great place and hope to return some day again. 'Palya'."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"While visiting, went to the sunrise, sunset and the base walk! The walk did take the whole 2.5hrs and would be best to start early in the morning to miss the mid day sun 😀"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"First time experience at Uluru so much to do and see thats for sure , The colours from sunrise to sunset are just a magic experience, We stayed 3 nights at the Resort right next door to this iconic landmark. PS"" Uluru climb in Northern Territory should be banned WE GOT TO EDUCATE NOT DISCRIMINATE"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My husband, our 1 and 1/2 year old (in a child carrier on my husbands back) and I did walk/climb up the rock and I'm so glad we did. It was amazing, the beauty and magnitude of it is unbelievable. You just can't grasp it in a picture! The first section is very steep and has a chain to hold onto. There are few spots to stop and rest. The rest is undulating until you reach the end of the track. The Rock is closed in high winds or when rain is forecast, so pick your days well. It is most definitely the highlight of our trip there. Also take a hat and lots of water!! The rim walk was a long 12km walk in the sun. It was nice, with a few nice gorges and aboriginal paintings to look at along the way. (I did see that there were Segway tours and would have preferred to do it that way) you can drive to the scenic points along the way, if you don't want to walk it. The track has very little shade. So again, take hat and lots of water."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had been to Uluru some 20 years ago and promised ourselves that "" some day "" we would come back and do the full base walk ... well a big number anniversary and the attraction of the Field of Light being extended drew us back to the red centre . We choose SE IT for the tour and were not disappointed .Valerie was a marvellous guide and it was fantastic to receive not only the indigenous insights upon this sacred area but also the full geological run down as well .The pace of the walk was comfortable and Valerie ensured that there were frequent rests for information updates as well as us being "" on time "" to see special events ( sunrise at SE IT's great spot for colour ), a generous breakfast and comfort stop when needed :) and thereafter to walk in the shade and missing the crowds whilst avoiding directly walking into the sun - well timed all round . Uluru experience 2nd time around was even better than the first - thx Valerie !"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I had been captivated by Uluru since childhood, and recently spent 3 days with the family to visit. Uluru is best seen from any of a number of sand dunes a short walk from the Ayers Rock Resort, although there are other locations closer to the National Park that give better views and are located for optimal sun rise and sun set viewing. Seeing Uluru from one of these dunes during sunset is a magical experience. The rock rises distinctively out of the relatively flat landscape of red earth and desert vegetation. Its colour changes by the hour, and when there are some clouds, the sky becomes a magical work of art lit by the setting sun. I'm so pleased I achieved a childhood goal of seeing this wonderful and ancient site. It is really worth the 3+ hour flight from Sydney. Yes, it is."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After checking in at the resort climb the Imalung lookout in the middle for an overall view.There's another lookout about 500m south of the Outback Pioneer that’s worth a look also. We went on the free tour provided by the park rangers. Worth doing but don't be shy and ask questions. The tour is an easy 2-3km in June and takes about 2hours. The walk around the rock in total is about 13km; there's two spots for water but NO TOILETS so I hope you have a better bladder than me. The cultural centre is interesting. If you want to buy a indigenous artwork there's actually two shops, the second near the exit. We hired a car for the three days (book online before you go) and drove to see Uluru both a sunset and sunrise. The colour of the rock I felt didn’t change that much but the sky was amazing. We also drove out to Kata Tjuta and walked the short version of Valley of the Winds (I think). Again, only the parking area has water and a toilet. First hour of the walk is OK but after that the tracks is strewn with large rocks making walking difficult. Though we didn't do it, dusk and dawn would be awe inspiring here as well. If visiting Australia it has to be on your bucket list."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Myself and two friends spent 2 nights/3 days out at Ayers Rock and we did the sunrise walk around Uluru with Seit tours. It was such an amazing experience. Definately something everyone should do at least once in their lifetime! We started our walk in the dark around 6am and it was so quiet and peaceful but really chilly! So if you go in winter - rug up!! We saw an amazing sunrise while walking around learning about the fauna and vegetation surrounding the rock - and there is so much!! I thought it would be baron but it is quite dense and green! We also got up close and personal with the rock and saw how mother nature is engraving it over time. I was amazed at how many holes, caves, cut outs and designs are in the rock itself. You think its just going to one solid structure but its not. And the waterholes are very peaceful, pretty and soothing. The company itself was great. Amy (I think - she was a belgium girl) was amazing. So pleasant and full of information. The only thing I would suggest is to stop for breakfast a lot earlier than we did. We all thought we were going to stop for breakfast about 30 mins into the walk but it was 3 hours later! The hot water for tea/coffee was not hot anymore and we were starving by then. otherwise it was definately worth doing."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a great weekend away. I must admit my expectations were pretty low and I was amazed by Uluru and left a huge fan. We had an amazing weekend exploring the national park and both attractions Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Both are must sees. Uluru has a great base walk that takes about 2-3 hours and is flat. We did the walk straight after sunrise to beat the crowds and it does get cold at some points when the rock is blocking the sun. Watching the sun break through the rock was pretty amazing. Kata Tjuta takes about 40min to drive and has less people and is beautiful. We did the two main walks valley of the winds and the gorge - approx 1 hour each and they were just stunning - highly recommended. Recommend this area for a picnic as it's a lot quieter than Uluru. I'd highly recommend using the designated sunrise and sunset viewing areas, getting a spot for sunset about 2 hours before hand (if watching from the car) hiring your own car to drive around at your own pace, bringing alcohol into uluru ($38 a six pack of beer), bringing lots of water it's really dry, and bringing a picnic into the park."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You must do the Mala walk before anything else at Uluru so that you gain understanding and insight into the Anangu culture.Fantastic ranger lead walk was such an education, culturally and spiritually. Now I know why they don't want you to climb the rock - will you find out why?"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I felt that on my first trip to Australia (hopefully not the last) I had to go to Uluru. So glad I made the trip. An amazing place. The base walk was a fantastic way of seeing this iconic geological wonder close up with beautiful colours - great for photography. It was cool first thing in the morning but warmed up later. AAT Kings led our walk and the guide (Tachy) was very informative. So glad I was able to experience it this way.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We flew over it, walked around it, saw it at both sunrise and sunset. It is breathtaking and should be a wonder of the world. It is a spiritual place. The local aborigines ask people not to walk on it but despite this people still do. Walk around the base like we did. It is fantastic."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When I visited the winds were particularly bad so I was unable to climb, but I did the hike around Uluru and found it to be great. I was mostly alone throughout the hike, so be prepared with water, etc, but I feel like I got to see parts of the area others on organized tours may not. There had also been some rain that created beautiful slender waterfalls, and I took some great photos that I have framed now. Getting to the Red Center is a bit of a trek, and I met plenty of Aussies during my backpacking around Australia that said they never had seen the rock. In my opinion, it was one of the highlights of my trip to Australia, and worth the extra effort and expense to make it there. The purported color changes were subtle from my perspective, but I feel like I got to see something that I had only ever read about in passing. The landscape is unusual from my perspective as an ecologist in the American West, and that alone made it worth the visit for me. Make sure you have plenty of water, and it doesn't hurt to have a fly mask as there were times when I was glad I had one."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Not a bad day but very cold at the start. it got warmer. We walked around the rim because we couldn't climb it. I know, some of you wont like that I wanted to climb it. I've done it before and wanted to do it again. If any of the locals were around to talk about it then I might have had another opinion."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We love visiting Uluru! This is our third time visiting and will be returning for a 4th time later this year. The camel ride is ALWAYS our favourite thing to do at Ayers Rock. Especially the sunset or sunrise ones!! However, a hike around the rock or any sunrise/sunset excursions are highly recommended"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We can defiantly say its worth the trip to see this iconic destination. Seeing it is way better than photo's. The sunset from the car park is worth getting there and waiting for as is the sunrise. We did the base walk and hiked all over the place while there, as well as going over to Katu Tjuta/Olga's, so the $25 each for 3 days entry to park to come and go is really good value. Uluru totally amazing up close."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Visiting Uluru was amazing even though I had been before. Seeing photos of Uluru doesn't do it justice. It needs to be seen to be believed. I loved the Mala walk. It was very informative. I loved hearing about the traditional owners. There should be more traditional owners as rangers
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Well worth the trip to see the rock in the desert in central Australia. It is an awesome sight to see changes colour from different angles but the red rock in the sun is the iconic view. Kata Tjuta or the Olga's are nearly as awesome some people we have talked to found them more so than the rock but to both of us Ayers Rock was the best part of our trip that included Cairns an Port Douglas that were both good but this was better. We did a helicopter flight of both the rock and Olga's which I'd rate very highly. Also walked around the rock was too windy to climb the rock apparently fates shut and warnings not to. There are 2 walks at the Olga's we did the Walpa gorge walk a fairly easy hour walk very enjoyable.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Went on a three days short break to Uluru and Kata juta national Park was amazing experience. My 11 yr old loved it as it was also related to what he studied. Good experience to see the Red centre. Know the aboriginal culture.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Booking this trip was very similar to book Cuba... does not matter how much you research for hotels and activities,,, you end up with the same company. Cuba the government controls all booking, here it's a monopoly also, despite that we had an amazing time. I could feel the presence of our Creator thru this arid desert and this amazing red monolith rock. Colors change at sunrise and sunset."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is one of the most stunning & beautiful places I have ever visited , sunset & sun rise are only the beginning! A bike ride or a walk around Uluru is a absolute must, spend as much time doing as you can. Water & good shoes are a must if you walk around it (about 10 km) and it is a easy ride if you wish."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Better than expected, the colour changes during the day and at sunset are incredible, well worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a very peaceful and beautiful area. There are many interesting and surprising sights to see as you walk around Uluru. I didn't and wouldn't consider climbing Uluru. It is very steep, slippery and disrespectful to the aboriginal community. there is enough beauty around Uluru to enjoy without the need to climb."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We were prepared to be disappointed by Uluru but that was absolutely not the case. You cannot hep but be impressed by your first sighting as you approach by road. It is absolutely surreal. Clearly there is a risk that such a unique attraction is overwhelmed by tourists but generally this seemed to be very well managed. We were fortunate to be travelling independently with a hire car so we could choose when and where to go. Parking in the general area of Uluru is well controlled. There is a perimeter road off which there are seperate defined car parks/viewing areas for coaches and cars. Parking on the road is not permitted. Having bought our entrance ticket to the Park earlier ($25 each) we arrived at a car park an hour or so before sunset and other vehicles were already arriving. It was busy but by no means overcrowded. The sunset was maybe not as red as it could be but still very beautiful. We the took the Dawn Awakening tour from our hotel early the following morning to hear and see more with a guide. An ambition achieved!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After seeing Uluru from a distance for sunrise and sunset tours, we made our way to the recommended sunrise and sunset locations to experience the magnificence closer. Arriving at least 30 minutes before sunrise or sunset ensures that you experience all of the lighting changes and feel the full experience of the magical and sacred site. Truly awe-inspiring and view that keeps giving its full effect. Uluru at all times of the day still gives you a strong perspective of how special the entire location is."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This attraction is awe-inspiring. No matter what time of day you visit it presents something new and beautiful. We stayed in the park for the sunset and were truly impressed. Our guide made us stay 30 minutes after everyone else had left. It gave us an additional experience. The sun behind the earth but lighting the clouds and Uluru was something we will never forget. The sunrise the next morning was equally impressive, but in reverse. The only negative were the flies. Make sure to get a head screen covering. It will make you visit more enjoyable."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Visited Uluru for both sunrise and sunset. Two very different experiences but equally beautiful. The different colours were breathtaking
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This place is amazing, photo's do not do it justice. To go and see the actual size and learn the relevance to the indiginous people is a must do in your life. We are glad we did."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a lot more than a big red rock, but from a distance it can seem fairly unspectacular. There are unfortunately several thousand other visitors all trying to see it at sunrise and sunset, and going to the standard viewpoints on a coach is pretty unfulfilling. The organised tours are ridiculously expensive (though the aboriginal tours and offbeat ones are more interesting) and there's no transport available, so it's essential to hire a car. Arrange this beforehand to avoid OTT rates, and then have the freedom to go where and when you want. The driving is easy but the distances from the resort still considerable."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Visited this iconic part of Australia recently and we were in awe of the magnificence of Uluru. It is a truly special place to visit whether you decide to trek around the base or take one of the shorter walks. We chose not to climb Uluru out of respect to the traditional Indigenous owners but found it a compelling place to view. Guided tours are available where you are able to learn more about the Indigenous beliefs and important roles Uluru has played.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There are no words to describe the feeling of being at Uluru. It is truly one of the most incredible places in the world. We did the ride around the base with our children (aged 5, 8 and 9) and this was definitely the best way to do it with kids. The kids loved it (our 5 year old was on a tag-a-long) and we got off every now and then to look at water holes, etc. We also went to the viewing area to watch the sunset which was spectacular. It does tend to get busy at sun set, but definitely worth it. We took a picnic tea of chicken and breadrolls - was fabulous!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The size says it all. You see it in photographs but nothing prepares you when you are close up to it. It has a visitors centre showing the way people lived in the past and there are art studios with pictures to buy. Drinks and a café on site. Car parking is near by. 6 miles around so you only get to see a small piece of it. Sunset was around 7pm and coaches fill the parking area quickly. Tables are laid with drink and snacks, see the rock change colour in minutes, locals sell pictures and it is bad for there spirits to take photos of them. Sun rise was 7am onwards with a view stage up a sand dune. All decked out to give a clear view."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is one of those places that you should definitely see in your lifetime. It's a beautiful places with a mystical feeling about it and the Aboriginal stories are wonderful to listen to. My suggestion would be to see the rock by segway - try the Uluru Segway Tour - friendly staff and awesome fun!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Beautiful part of Australia. A must visit place in the outback. We hired a campervan in Sydney and drove to Ayres Rock. 6000 miles round trip. Camping all the way. Fantastic trip.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Nothing can really prepare you for standing first at the foot of this mighty rock. It is genuinely awe-inspiring. Learning about it's geological past and cultural significance is a must.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"How do you describe in words a magical, sacred rock such as Uluru? The sunset viewing was sublime. We were so lucky to have perfect weather. Tip- watch out on the sides of the road for tiny Thorny Devils. So cute!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru should be visited by all Australians. It is an iconic location The heart of our great land. We spent time walking and enjoying and taking lots of photos
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Sunset or sunrise, the views are magnificent. Explore the surrounds of Uluru, take in the rich, red earth, the stories of the Anangu people and their cave drawings."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We flew over it, walked around it and covered it from every angle but climb it as the Aboriginal people have asked us not to climb it as is their right. We did sunrise walks and sunset fly overs and I have to say it was so impressive. A real must do."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It is special and my title doesn't do it justice but it is just a big rusty rock. You can see why it holds a special place with the Aboriginal people being this big lump in the middle of a flat land. It is interesting seeing the different aspects and colours as the morning went on (we went on a sunrise trip). It is easily accessible with good walking tracks. We didn't climb as we wanted to respect the Aboriginal culture and didn't miss it. A place steeped in ancient stories! The stories come part and parcel with the rock so if you don't do a tour then you will need some other way to get the context. At the end of the day you wouldn't come to Yulara without getting close to the rock - it is interesting but not amazing.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,When we first saw the Rock it was in omg- it just takes your breath away. We had a room overlooking the Rock so was able to watch the colour changes that happen through out day. the weather is cool in the morning and quite pleasant during the day where you can wear a tee shirt.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The view of the rock is great. Abit disappointing with sunrise and sunset because the sunset and rises behind the viewing area not behind the rock. Still nice but not what l expected. Turned around and took photos of sunset and sunrise behind me. Its a big rock. We also went on tour to the rock and touched it and did some walking too. Didn't get o climb it on our tour but some people were up climbing it. Would have loved to climb it.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I flew into Yulara for a 4 night stay which was not enough as also travelled to Kings Canyon and Kata Tjuta (the Olgas). I can highly recommend the walk around Uluru. We (a couple of friends and I ) had hired a car so drove out there and went to the cultural centre and got advice and maps... The walk is easy and flat ...I think about 11 ks ...we were a group of 3 in our 50s and 60s ..not ultra fit but it was easy to do and gave you a real feel for the area. I recommend going off and viewing all the water holes etc...which adds to the walk. We packed plenty of water and our lunch. They have nice places to sit ...beautifully carved benches under shelters maybe about every 3 or 4 ks. They also have dirinking water about half way around. There are maps telling you where you are in relation to the whole walk every 2 or 3 ks. We found a beautiful place by a waterhole for lunch. We were mesmerised by the people climbing the Rock. I did not want to do it as want to respect the Aboriginal peoples wishes but also do not like heights and this is a seriously scary thing to do. Apparently 30% of people who visit Uluru still want to climb it ..but when it drops to 20% they will then ban it. 37 people have died whilst climbing it and you can see some plaques for them. We really loved walking around. You can bike ride or Segway around it but I think with walking you get to experience the sights sounds and feel of Uluru so much better.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It's the only place in Australia I knew 100% that I wanted to see and it was worth the 3000km bus ride from Melbourne (did a great tour w Intrepid) to get there. I have so many photos of this big red sacred rock. I did the sunrise walk around the rim which I highly recommend as you walk around the colors change with the light. And each side of the rock has something remarkable to admire. It feels being on another world and it's no wonder that the indigenous people believe it's sacred. It's quite incredible.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Go out to 'the rock' at any opportunity -especially to share with overseas visitors. The magic of this place is unsurpassed
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Our guide was very good and answered all the questions we asked. After our guided walk we had a wonderful walk around Uluru. Then we went on to the Cultura Centre which was very interesting.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Absolutely fantastic! We did a short trip to Uluru 3 nights which was perfect. The rock is awe inspiring and the photos really don't do it justice, you really can't capture the enormity and spiritual presence. We hired bikes and cycled our way around the base, I thoroughly recommend this it was a great way to experience the rock, the ride was very easy with beautiful pathways all the way around. I was impressed with the overall park and its pristine condition everything is so well maintained."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is our third time here and it never ceases to amaze me how beautiful this place is. We walked the base in around 3.5 hours and it was very pleasant this time of year. Will definitely come again.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A little publicized but excellent way to see Uluru is by riding rented bicycles around the base at your own pace. A walk can very very long, perhaps interesting with a guide, but biking was much cooler, took less time while enabling us to read interesting placards, and a bit of exercise after lots of eating and drinking. Outback Cycles is not pushed as aggressively as many package tours are, and if you are interested in sunrise or sunset tours others may be a better option. However, the HopOn HopOff buses get you into the park and bike rental is at the entrance to the cultural center and could not be easier. Fly nets, for purchase at the IGA, hotels and the cultural center are a MUST, as is drinking water."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What a special place. You have to get up & close. We were lucky enough to see it from the ground & via helicopter. Just incredible.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We are traveling as a family with adult children- trip advisor does not give this option! We highly recommend the SEIT base walk sunrise tour. Our guide, Valery, was fantastic. We arrived in time to witness an amazing sunrise. Watching Uluru change colour is something that needs to be seen in order to truly appreciate its beauty. As we watched on, we sipped from our thermos' that was provided by Valery. Throughout the 12km walk, we were immersed in the incredible history and creation stories of Uluru. This is not to be missed!!!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Spent some time at Ayers Rock Resort and took a number of activities while staying there. Would highly recommend the Night in the Field of Light (sunset at Uluru) and the Desert Awakenings (sunrise at Uluru) tours. Well worth visiting the Cultural Centre and the pool at the base of the rock.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The very red desert is dominated by a rock so big that you have to see it to believe it. I recommend that you don't wear white clothing!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The place is special. I didn't expect to be this amazing experience. We were there during Easter holiday, the accommodation around the rock was fully booked. The kids enjoyed the sight seeing very much. We paid respect by followed the sign and statement at the car park by not climbing the rock. Best spot to take the picture would be from designated car or bus bay. We bought a 3 day pass as we really need to get in and out to see the rock at morning, noon, early afternoon and sun set. Worth it! It cost us $65 per car. The drive from park entry is around 10 km. The view while driving closer is stunning. Prepare water, hat with fly net if preferred and sun screen. The walk can be chosen from 2.4 km to the full walk."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is the sort of place that you might think is a bit cliched, but trust me when I say you must do it at least once. The rock itself is vast, imposing and somehow mysterious. Whether you look at it from a distance, at sunset or sunrise, or up close, it is simply jaw dropping. Make sure you visit a few times at different distances and times. The colour change thing you hear about is subtle, but when you take photos over the half hour before sunset, you can see it moves from a light orange-brown to ochre and red to almost chocolate brown after the sun has set."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A magestic landmark with spiritual significance. Wonderous landscapw with red soil but an abundance of flora at the base. It is recommended you do not climb Uluru out of repect to the traditional owners. Worth the trip and it is recommended you stay 3 night to enable you to see all the National Park has to offer
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The trip to Uluru was wonderful. We initially had the AAT Kings tour which provided the information around Uluru. We then returned another day and did the bike ride around and saw the remainder. I found these 2 combined was a great way to see this magnificent site.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was the most humbling and beautiful place. The bird life was amazing. The plants and every step you take venturing around this amazing icon, provides a stunning scene, with surprises too."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The pictures don't do it justice. The naked eye sees it very differently. We saw it in the afternoon and then again we had the sunrise tour. Fantastic colours - awe inspiring. No wonder the aborigines see this as a very special place - we all have a responsibility to look after it. The heat in the afternoon was excessive, but it all adds to the atmosphere - make sure you have a hat, sunscreen, sun glasses and plenty of water. Probably will never go back, but the image will live with us forever."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Spend the money and travel around the base of Uluru on. Segway, the best way to travel around Uluru. Experienced guides, training, safety gear, transfers all included. So much fun!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I am Australian and I have travelled fairly extensively overseas and a fair bit within Australia. Uluru has always been on my bucket list but because it is in my country and so close (only a little over 3,000 km by reasonably travelled road ;-)), my wife and I always left it until later as overseas.travel beckoned. After an illness we decided to do this trip now and I wonder now why we left it so long. First the Rock itself is awe inspiring and to touch it leaves tingles. We did not climb it as that would be disrespectful. We chose to take a number of tours with AAT Kings and they also booked our accommodation. We chose the cheapest accommodation options as all we needed was a bed and somewhere to eat - and of course a shower and toilet in our room. We were very happy with our accommodation. The AAT tours often started very very early which does not make for a relaxing holiday, but there were good reasons for this and we were not looking for a relaxing holiday - we wanted to see stuff. All of our AAT tours turned up on time and the drivers/guides were very knowledgeable and very respectful of the original inhabitants. We travelled over a reasonable amount of NT in a short time including here and south of Darwin and the standard maintained by NT Government at these sites was impeccable. I will post more individually relevant posts. I feel a connection to my Country"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Sunrise at Uluru is pretty spectacular at any viewing point. Most people aim for the highest vigil and tussle to get a good view of the light coming over the horizon. The site is know as Talinguru Nyakunytjaku and once you have parked there, locate the viewing platforms facing the rock. Then go down towards the rock. There are at least 2 different pathways at different heights that will give you an uninterrupted view of the rock where you won't have to jostle to get to see it. Be prepared however, for the cold blast that follows the sunrise. The temperature dropped by around 6 degrees centigrade, and even though we were all rugged up, we froze. But don't miss it. It is truly splendid to see the way the rock changes colour. Enjoy. It really is the heart of Australia."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Despite the crowds, the iconic sunrise and sunset views are still worth seeing. The ranger-guided walk from the Mala carpark is really interesting, although due to the large group size we found the pace a little slow. The base walk is well worth doing as it helps you appreciate the size of the rock and there are so many details and different aspects to appreciate as you walk round."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Having experienced the sunrise at Kata Tjuta earlier in the day, my partner and I boarded the AATKings coach to experience the sunset at Uluru. Once again, AATKings had setup Canapes and refreshments for us to enjoy as we watched the sun set. The colour changes on The Rock are truly spectacular and seriously worth the effort of being there. After the sunset, AATKings provided a terrific barbeque and star gazing/identification experience. Once again, my partner and I have only praise for the AATKings staff and timing."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is a sacred place and it will take your breath away. It is amazing any time of the year. If you are lucky enough to see it in the rain even more special. Please don't climb the rock, this is extremely disrespectful to the traditional owners. Of course it is hot and there are flies, this is the Australian outback. Most activities in the park are very expensive but there are also some excellent free things to participate in. Join the free two hour ranger tour of Uluru at 8am, excellent, the free theatre production depicting a dreamtime story and a free guided tour of the art gallery/museum in the town centre. Do the 11 km walk around the rock if you are able and also the valley of the wind walk through Kata Tjuta, both spectacular."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Absolutely beauty, even though it's just a rock my personal opinion is a must see. I love seeing amazing places like this , red dirt , súper outback , only thing I don't like are the flies , the rest gorgeous"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"April is still hot, we had 34-36 degrees Celsius during the day but the nights were nicer temps. We hired bicycles to go around Uluru one afternoon which is a great idea just a shame it was so hot! A pretty place we enjoyed a lot but we did end up spending more time at Kata Tjuta (the Olga's)."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Inevitably busy, with groups arriving and leaving all the time. It was useful to hear some guides briefing their groups. Walks around the base were varied enough, generally flat and well marked. Cultural information was given, but extensively ignored by many, including climbing the rock itself when specifically asked not to. The walk around the base is no doubt easier, but meets the exercise experience without the offence! Some groups started whilst we were there and luckily stopped when the full challenge became apparent, as many were neither fit enough nor dressed to tackle it safely. Over 100 people have died attempting this and the recovery of those getting caught out is expensive and carried out by the very people whose culture is not to climb the Rock. On a positive note make time to sit and absorb. Take fly repellent, although they take little note of it so a good head net is needed if you cannot ignore them; buy in advance! Try to get to different places to view sunrise and sunset over several days if you can as the light and conditions change so much."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Every Australian should plan to visit Uluru at least once. There were plenty of other tourists around but most of the time it felt like we were the only ones for miles. Get up for the obligatory sunrise photos and then start your walks early before the day heats up. The base walk is long but not strenuous or taxing. We didn’t do the climb out of respect for the aboriginal culture. Photos cannot replicate or do justice to the majesty of The Rock. Awe-inspiring.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is amazing. It's great to do the walk around the base of Uluru. However unfortunately you can't climb it anymore.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One of Australia's highlights. Uluru is a wonder to see during the day, at sunset and at sunrise. It is not a cheap or easy place to visit but if you have time and money well worth visiting"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,whould like too work here but they do not employ persons that not abogiginal persons or if you over 70+ great place to visit for holiday will allway come back good in the aprile as temp low people so great to you they realy know how to treat the guesst
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"First time I went here was a few years ago. I went with hubby, we stayed at the Sails in the Desert and went on sunset tour, camel tour etc. It was ok but not fantastic. This time I drove here by myself, camped 3 nights at the caravan park and this time I enjoyed the park so much more. Having my own car and be able to drive into the park on my own made such a difference. I was able to go and see Kata-Tjuta and Uluru at sunrise and sunset and it was all much easier and cheaper than booking tour buses. I bought a parks pass for 3 days, I think it was no more than $25 - great value. To fight off flies I had a fly veil, that also makes the experience of the park so much more enjoyable when you don't have 1000s of flies buzzing your face. It's a shame though the park isn't open at night, I would have loved to photograph a startrail with either Uluru or Kata-Tjuta but the park closes shortly after dark. Weather was good, hot and sunny in March. Other told me there had been quite a bit of rain in the weeks before I went. All roads in and around the park are sealed. There is a grocery store and fuel station in Yulara, just outside the park, where all the accommodation is."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Nice camp site, superb hotel but expensive. The Rock is of course very touristy but worth a visit, if the weather is calm you can climb the rock but the locals don't like you doing it. Some great viewing points to see the sunset, it's spectacular."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We arrived shortly after a big storm had passed through, although we still had rain, some small waterfalls were still visible from the rock. We watched the sunrise over the rock - a must see at least once in your life. Also segwayed around the base - highly recommended. No 2 parts of this amazing monolith are the same."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Never been before and totally exceeded my expectations. Uluru sunrise, Uluru sunset - amazing light. Also did a base walk - flat ground and not strenuous. Can also hire bikes at the cultural centre in the national park and ride around the rock if you prefer"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Beautiful place to walk around, and also hike. But it gets magical when you heat the stories from the rangers, who tell the creation stories of the Anangu people. The stories are part of their religion (Tjukurpa) and make you really appreciate their history, culture, and the national park."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This rock has so many sides to look at. Depending on the time of day, you will see different features of it. Our first night here we drove to the sunset viewing area. There is a car one and a bus one. We drove to the car one. We had our supper watching the sunset on the rock. It was beautiful. On the drive home the white grass with the trees in the desert made the land look fairy tale like. It was surreal."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My wife and I were on a small tour of Uluru with SE-IT Outback Tours,with our guide Emilie (a Belgium Lady) who was one of the best guides we have encountered. She made sure that her walking pace was okay for us to keep up with,she knew all the relevant cultural facts and was considerate of our privacy when other groups were encountered. As my wife and I were the oldest in the group of 7 she did not make us feel in any way different to the others but treated us equally. Her enthusiasm for the details of what mattered was infectious. She drove the mini-bus as well! Excellent job Emilie"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This visit to Uluru was the culmination of 30 odd years of saying, we must go there one day, till eventually we just bit the bullet and did it. It was worth it. Climbing the rock wasn't an option on the days we were there, forecast rain, even if the sky is blue, is enough for the park rangers to close access to the trail. However, the 10km walk around was are fall back option, and it was a good substitute. Feeling longer than 10k's, the walk includes information stops, small side tracks into areas close to the rock, and some great views that a climb wouldn't expose you to. Ensue you have a good amount of water, but the overall flatness of the track ensures almost anybody could complete it, with rests when required."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is an attraction well worth visiting at both sunset and sunrise.There is a three day park entry fee ($25 each) and two different viewing areas to capture both. We found that although you can capture Kata Tjuta and Uluru at the Talinguru Nyakunytjaku (TN) viewing area, there were trees slightly in the way. We therefore drove back to the first viewing area to get our sunset shots. We did return to TN the following morning though to get sunrise shots, the colours upon Uluru were quite spectacular. Setting off early is recommended to get a good photo spot as it gets quite busy. We respected the local cultural wishes and did not climb the rock although we saw people doing so. Totally recommend."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If feels as if you're in the middle of nowhere then you see this magnificent rock. Our guide for the sunrise tour was very informative. I learned so much about the area, the people, and the wildlife. Great location. I didn't want to leave."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru was a must see when I decided on a trip to Australia. I was in a tour group and we went to various areas around and in Uluru but there are also trails to go around the entire rock. It is a sight to see and we were able to view Uluru at sunset and sunrise. It is such a beautiful and peaceful place to see and I definitely recommend it. The Australian government allows people to climb on top of Uluru but the natives ask you not to because it a very sacred place. So please do ask the natives ask and DO NOT CLIMB ULURU!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,the walk around is sooooo much more impressive then climbing on uluru.it's an impressive rock! loved it
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We booked SEIT Uluru Trek to start walking the Rock pre-dawn, and notwithstanding the rain (yes, I heard exceptionally lucky....) we managed a squeak out of the sunrise, and had an incredible walk with our tour guide. Our guide was knowledgable and could explain the history of the aboriginals as we walked around, we had a good discussion on the birds that inhabited the area and generally the history. All-in-all an experience that we thoroughly enjoyed because of our guide, and II would most definitely book again with SEIT."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The rock is beautiful and impressive. The aboriginal tribes are responible for exploiting the area. They forbid everything which you can do for free like climbing the rock and taking pictures. But they encourage everything they can charge you for, so you can't climb the rock but you can cycle around it, motorcyle around it, hire a Harley Davidson, Segway around it or even skydive or helicopter around it. I believe the site is sacred to some people but in that case I would keep the Segways and motorcycles as far away from the site as possible and instead I would welcome the respectful visitors on foot but here it seems to be the other way around."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Loved it again. My fourth visit in 25 years and not my last. A must to really indeed the spiritual indigenous heart of Australia.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Took a dawn helicopter ride for an hour to see the amazing Uluru from different angles followed by Kata Tjuta then over Lake Amadeus. Quite a distance to fit into one hour but well worth the cost! Even though you don't actually fly over the top of the monoliths you still get awesome views from a great height and get see the vegetation from another perspective...
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I thought that I could spend a day here but luckily I had three there are so many little tracks and trails the rock itself is beautiful and changes colour through out the day a must see
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is one of those sites you have to physically see for yourself the awesome size of this rock in a desert setting. We were there for 2 days and both days had heavy overcast in the morning and evening so the spectacular reds, purples etc we didn't see. We did walk the 10k around the rock in early morning on an Indigenous guided tour about the culture and sacred meaning of the rock. They don't want you to climb the rock for sacred reasons, but some still climb the rock. It takes about 20 mins from the Ayers Rock Resorts to the base of the rock by bus. You need to buy a park pass to enter, they offer multi-day passes also. Things to remember if you go from Dec - Mar is that it will be hot, bring water, bush flies are out (net), good footwear, sunglasses & hat. Most people go in by bus, but you can drive in yourself if not on a tour. They have sunrise, day and sunset viewings of Ayers Rock from a special viewing area about 5 miles away."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Very impressive. The 280 mile drive from Alice Springs just adds to the anticipation, which is fulfilled upon arrival. If possible, go with a knowledgeable and entertaining tour guide (ours was Myles from AATKings) to get the full story behind the rock... geological, aboriginal and modern history. It was fascinating to see the string of ""ants"" making their way up the designated (and only) climbing route, especially after hearing about the 36 or so deaths from failed attempts... which, of course, just adds to the tension between the ""traditional owners"" and tourists who don't respect the culture. Saw a four or five foot sand goanna (big lizard) in the rocks near some aboriginal drawings. Nice Cultural Centre with exhibits, aboriginal art studio and store, gift shop, information desk, and bathrooms. Watching the sun set from the tour bus lot with wine and hors d'oeuvres was a bit of a zoo, and, while pretty, didn't live up to the hype in my opinion. Very glad we made the effort to get to Uluru!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru sits majestically in the center of Australia with its 'wingmen' Mount Connor and Kata Tjuta on either side seemingly equidistant from each other. Take a guided tour around the base to learn about the Indigenous stories and art that relate to the creation period (Tjukurpa). The traditional owners, the Anangu people, ask that visitors respect their culture and desist from climbing to the top of Uluru. The walk around the base is about 12 kms so take plenty of water and allow enough time to soak in the magical atmosphere of this geological wonder."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Being on a Scenic touring holiday a visit to Uluru is included, how glad we were. The Rock is magnificent, we had a tour, which included walking around part of the base in the morning, even the heat and flies could not detract from the experience. Later in the day we took part in the sunset followed by dinner and a visit to Lights under the stars experience and the next morning were up to watch the sunrise so we could see the colour changes of the Rock. Our visit here was the highlight of a wonderful holiday. Standing here I could understand why it is so important to the aboriginal people."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visited Uluru during the day and returned for the sunset over the rock. Once we paid our park admission, we got the best of everything for no more spend. The full moon sunset over Uluru from the free car park viewing area was a highlight for sure"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Enjoyed a morning run around the rock (10km) as well as sunrise and sunset viewings and some smaller hikes with kids. Spectacular but much better on your own pace than with organized tours that charge you a huge premium and then rush you around like cattle. Be prepared for flies!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ranger was very informative. Dips and nibbles served with a chilled glass of bubbles whilst we watched the sun go down
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went to view at both Sunset and Sunrise. As we rented a car, and would highly recommend that, we drove to two relevant locations. Personally I preferred the colours of Sunset, but was glad to see it at Sunrise too. After the sunrise visit we joined the Mala Walk, starts from the same named car park. This was very enjoyable, especially as a couple of Aboriginal guides were there too. It took nearly two hours and the pointed out a lot of things that would get missed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Waited a long time to get here, had high expectations and was not disappointed. Did a late afternoon walk around part of the base of the rock. The caves and rock drawings/art are very well preserved and great to look at. We were there a few weeks after a lot of rain so everything was green and the pools had water in them. The flies were not too bad. Some people used fly nets to keep them off of their faces. There are some sections of the rock that are sacred and no photography is allowed. There is a ""chain"" up one of the sections of the rock that is used to assist climbers. We got to meet the man who put this in when we stopped in Curtin Springs."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru (Ayers Rock), I believe that my Wife & I, just through pure luck, that our itinerary to this amazing place coincided with earlier rains throughout the region several month previous, thereby enhancing the surrounding flora. Spinifex grasses were in abundance giving the surrounding landscape a vibrant yellow colour interspersed with the alternating landscape colours. The night sky was also a picturesque canvas, being lit with a full moon, selective star patterns, all of which aligned with an evening of outdoor dining surrounded by Bruce Munro's field of light artistry. Weather conditions during the day at this time of the year not hot, pleasant, an during the evenings a still coolness to cold, but no impact winds."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No words, no amount of photos will capture the drama of this rock. It is special. Not only to the indigenous people, but to all who see it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Tough tour but full of great stories, great landscapes, inspiration and reflection. I definitely recommend it in small groups."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A small group of us (3 women) visited for 3 days/2 nights on a self guided tour. Uluru has been high on my list to visit and it didn't disappoint. We rented a car, stayed at the Sails in the Desert and enjoyed the free activities. It's in a self contained resort with restaurants, cafes, grocery store, souvenir shop, post office and visitor center. The trip's highlights was sunrise and sunsets at Ayers Rock and Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) formation. A national park pass is $25/adult and good for 3 days. Ayers Rock has bigger crowds. Kata Tjuta is a longer drive from the resort but equally beautiful. Start early to stake a good spot at the viewing car parks, especially for sunsets. The visitor center in the park provides a good history of the indigenous culture and Anangu people. We also spent one night on the Field of Lights with high expectations. It was somewhat disappointing as many of the lights were broken and there were some loud (drunk?) people wandering around. If you don't like flies, get a head net from the IGA market. It was $4 and looked pretty silly but it worked and worth every penny. Uluru is not easy to get there but well worth the visit!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We were on an AAT tour with a visit to the cultural centre and the sunset viewing from the specially established parking area We also had the joy of being there on the full moon so not only the magical sunset with ""the rock"" changing colours as the sunsets but the just 10 minutes later the full moon rises this was magical Thanks to the AAT team who said wait for the moon they were right it was truly a bucket list item"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru dominates the local landscape and it is easy to understand its special significance for the local people. It is great to watch the colours on the rock change during the day, with sunrise and sunset being special. The surrounding landscape and the red ochre soil with spinifex grass offers real contrast. Be sure to observe the rock from different vantage points to appreciate the different features. Make sure you bring your camera!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Even though it looks just like the pictures, it's amazing to get to see it in real life. Take time to go all the way around it and also go at sunrise and sunset for amazing views as the color changes on the rocks. Beware!!! There are lots of flies!!!! I wish I had know that. I would have brought my net to wear over my hat to cover my face. Those flies are pesky!!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was on our bucket to do list. We booked a 3 day tour with Intrepid Connections, which was actually carried out by Outback Tour services. The whole experience was better than we expected. Uluru is a beautiful landmark and landscape. For some it's a lump of rock but as a natural and geological phenomenon it's amazing. You must make sure you visit at both sunset and sunrise as the colours change, and the atmosphere around the rock change too. It's beautiful in the sunlight but it's incredible as the bright red changes to a darker red almost brown, and then lightens up again in the morning. Our tour included coach pick up from our hotel in Alice Springs. We had regular stops for coffee and toilets en route through the outback, which has to be seen from ground level to really understand it's vastness, the colour, the flat landscape and maybe even some wildlife. To stop at the 'service stations' en route is quite and experience. Good job they exist, but why would you live or work there! Our tour took us to a camel farm where we experienced a short camel ride which was great fun at 0700 in the morning! We stayed overnight in two different campsites. The facilities are very good. The tents have hard floors, campbeds, electric light and fans. They were comfortable and we slept well. Toilet facilities are good campsite facilities with plenty of cubicles and showers. Each company had a different area on the campsite. We went to Uluru for sunset and enjoyed a glass of bubbles whilst waiting. Great views of the rock and the changing colours. Then next morning we rose very early and did the 10km base walk, right around the rock, starting before sunrise and finishing in the heat of the morning - about 3.5 hours. The walk is easy as the route is flat. The views are stunning. You get fairly close to the rock itself. You are requested to respect the Aboriginal site and not take photos at certain points and to not climb on the rock. But you can get the full experience just walking around and looking at everything. You can hire a local guide, cycle round or just do it yourself. I feel the experience is better if you have a guide who can expand on the Aboriginal stories, talk about the landscape and geological formation of the rock. Our tour guide was Kelly who was great fun, and very informative. Our camp host/chef was Matt who produced some great meals on limited facilities. We were a small group (9 on Day 1 and 6 on Day 2). Kelly was happy to adapt the tour to the group to spend as long or as little as we wanted. Other parts of our tour included a visit to Kata Tjuja and to Kings Canyon. And at the end of 3 hot and tiring and fascinating days we were dropped back at our hotel in Alice Springs. Thoroughly endorse and recommend visiting Uluru, preferably with Intrepid Connections or Outback Tours. You really must go here at least once in your lifetime."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is the place to be. It is so beautiful and humongous. The walk around Uluru is 9km the climb is a long way up. The animals are amazing i really like the lizards.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is absolutely gorgeous. Especially during sunrise and sunset, it is spectacular. The rock will appear to change colour as the sun moves across the sky. You should view from both the sunrise and sunset viewing platforms for each as there is a different taste to each. Also do not crowd around the platform, walk for a bit inside the area and find your own more quiet space and often the view is much better."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What can you say, it's a great big ol' rock and it is pretty fantastic. Go before sunrise and see it changing colors up to and in the sunrise. Take a walk around it in the morning or afternoon - it can easily be done in three hours, but allow for four, as there's plenty to look at. Take a break at the cultural center, though not perfect, it does give some shade and background information. Go back for the sunset and see the colors change even more spectacularly. Be aware, that the rock is half an hours drive from the resort area. I do recommend renting a car for the flexibility and ability to stop where you like."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visited Ayers Rock 40 years ago but it was still an awe-inspiring sight when you first see it again. We were lucky enough to be sitting on the left side of the plane as we flew into Ayers Rock airport and see Ayers Rock and the Olgas from the air. Then driving towards the Rock just blows you away with its hugeness. There is a $25 per person pass for 3 days of unlimited entry into the park, payable when you first drive in. There are plenty of signs and information around Ayers Rock to give you some background to the area. The sunrises and sunsets are a definite must as well - it must be one of the country's most photographed natural features !! We did the base walk which is a fantastic 3-4 hour level walk and gives a great perspective to the size and majesty of the iconic rock. February is the peak of summer heat here but starting the walk at 7am gave us ample time to stroll around the base and return before the heat of the day took over. The rock climb is closed from 8am throughout summer and it was also closed earlier than that time the day we were there due to high winds. We actually enjoyed being here in summer as the tourist crowds were presumably less than in peak season, and the weather was very manageable (we were camping). Flies didn't bother us too much either, but we did notice that most foreign tourists were wearing fly nets. Ayers Rock is a must see at least once in your lifetime. Shame that so many Aussies travel all around the world but neglect to see their own country and the amazing sights it has on offer."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was arranged by AAT Kings who are very efficient and always prompt on their timing. Indeed every excursion or transfer involving the resort was always reliable and in decent clean and cool coaches.The bad news is always the price in this monopoly market.We did a guided walk right around the base of Ayers Rock (12.5k) starting at 6am and getting back to our hotel by about 12.30am and quite tired (aged over 60). The cost was AUD149 each. With price out of the way I must say the experience was wonderful. We were blessed by having a guide whose origins were aborigine (his Anglised name being something like Alwyn). If you can go on something guided by him then do so and he will explain to you the real significance to the indigenous people of the Rock and its surroundings. He also gave us information about Aborigine customs and beliefs but, at the same time, also gave a pretty good Western scientific explanation as to how the Rock came about. With these explanations the Rock came alive for us. We were fortunate that the weather was not too hot and the flies were pretty inactive for most of the time so did not spoil the walk."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Absolutely stunning landscapes. Wether you want action or just a place to listen to the space and silence. This has something for everyone.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The only reason this attraction didn't get a 5 was the fact of having to buy a 3 day pass even if one is only there for 1 day apart from this small moan(maybe those who decide these times could do a one day pass) the rest of the adventure to the rock was FANTASTIC an absolute delight to visit, view and experience we did climb up s far as we could(said a prayer to the spirits first in respect and to ease our conscience) but be warned it is steep and one does have to be fit cos apparently many people have come to grief whilst in the attempt whatever you decide to do when there it is an ABSOLUTE AWESOME EXPERIENCE."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a wonderful sight uluru is beyond your expectations. Rising more and more as you get closer the monolith reveals itself,a fabulous sight! Less fabulous is the resort itself, overpriced food, drinks,and camping it's a case of once you get here we got you. You have no choice because the resort owns everything. The myth that the aborigines don't want you to climb the rock was dispelled by talking to a few locals apparently the young kids play all over it. A case of political correctness gone nuts,do the Harley tours fantastic to do and the best way to see the area."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Had an (early) wonderful morning doing a 4 hour walk around the base of Uluru. Our young indigenous guide Alwyn (Gari) was terrific. He has a wonderful knowledge of the Mala men and their stories and was able to give us a brief cultural history. His intelligent and respectful talk was a highlight. You need to see Uluru close up as it gives you a totally difference perspective than looking at it from a distance. a must to combine with a helicopter flight
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A visit to Uluru in your lifetime is a must! We walked the Base and we were in awe of the magnificence of this natural wonder! We enjoyed watching the sunrise and getting up close to the Rock! We learnt about the cultural aspects of Uluru and came away with a new respect and understanding of The Red Centre!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Until you see it in person the sheer size of this thing is hard to comprehend. I'm so glad we went here and got view the changing light at sunset and sunrise.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We were here for 48 hours and did three trips sunrise, sunset and field of dreams. Stunning and so glad we visited this location, if we had know how much there is to do here we would have stayed for another 2 nights. We did not even consider Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) and other available trips. We got everything out of the trip that we wanted."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We flew from Melbourne to Alice springs and rented a car. Our almost 5hr sirve was very nice enjoying the flat view and listening to music or audiobook. Road is in perfect condition and easy to get to Ayers Rock. Arrived on time to buy the park ticket (25AUD each) and explore right before sunset. The Olgas (kata tjuta) were espectacular! Next day explored the base of Uluru with a guide that told us stories and explained the meaning of the rock to the aboriginal and culture. Amazing views and experience. The Australian outback should be part of anyone's bucket list!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Great sunrises and sunsets with colours changing constantly. Will go back again to do the entire base either by segway or bike.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What can one say to somewhere so unique? Sunrise + sunset + Field of Light which is beyond words + historical rock art + a ride on a Harley
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I would recommend making sure you go to the official sites to see the sunrise and the sunset views of Uluru. Some tours take tourists to their own viewing areas, but these are far too far away from Uluru. Plan at least a half day ie early morning sunrise, and a tour of the rock - preferable walking around the rock which is a leisurely 10 klm flat, easy walk. Absolutely loved ""the rock"" and up close it is awe inspiring, huge and fasinating to learn about the geology, culture of the indigenous people etc. NB: Make sure you see both the sunrise and sunset from the official ""in park"" viewing areas. These are the best views by far."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We watched it at sunset & it was spectacular. We also went at sunrise & it was even more awesome. The colour changes with the sun angle so it's a time to see it.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you're in the area you cannot miss this. From when you first see it the rock is a fantastic sight, when you get there you have plenty of signposts offering information about the history."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is not the easiest place to visit but it is well worth the effort involved in getting there. A two night stay in the Ayer's rock resort will give you time to see sunrise and sunset. Park tickets are valid for 3 days and you can enter as many times as you want. I would recommend that you hire a car as this gives you the freedom to to do what you want. We hadn't pre- booked a car and were able to hire one at the resort. However we went out of school holidays and the hire car companies do recommend pre-booking.There are guided tours but these do tend to be long. It can be extremely hot and the flies are a pain. The shops in the resort do sell fly nets. You also need a lots of fluid and I would recommend buying a box of water bottles from the local shop. Driving around Uluru gives you fantastic views and there are plenty of places to stop.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There is something magical about Uluru and it is definitely not to be missed. We stayed for 2 nights at the Ayres Rock Resort with a hire car which enabled us to do the sunrise and sunset viewings, the (free) Mala guided walk, the Sounds of Silence dinner, and a visit to Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) to do the Valley of the Winds and Malpa Gorge walks. We visited in November and although there were still some flies there was no need for a fly net over your head, which you will almost certainly need in the summer. The whole experience was fantastic. Don't miss it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing views, amazing walks, amazing sunsets, sunrise, wildlife ! A great place to visit. I recommend to go there at least 3 days."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Sunrise at Uluru is great! That is why this is rated 5 stars. The tour we were on would rate 3. We went on an AAT Kings sunrise tour to see Uluru. We got to the viewing area about 10 minutes before sunrise. It was already full of people. Sunrise was at 6:30, we were told to be back on the bus at 6:40. This is the only time I was ever late to get back on the bus. And I did it on purpose. If you want to get photos or just really enjoy seeing the change of color as the sun comes up this tour in not for you. It is amazing to see Uluru change. But I would have liked to have spent more time there enjoying it. And on this tour, they then take you to an area where you could get out and walk to up close to Uluru. We were given 15 minutes to do this. Again not even close to enough time. There are other tours and tour companies. I wish I would have taken one that had a guided walk around Uluru after the sunrise. There is so much to learn and experience about Uluru. But really all we got was a rushed sunrise. And the coffee and biscuit they offer, I did not stop to get it because I did not want to miss the sunrise. Our travel agent picked this tour for us. So make sure you are getting a good tour before you commit to your itinerary."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My ideas of Uluru were nothing like those that I experienced on being up close and personal. Best time to walk around is in the morning as after about 11am it is very hot. Depends on the time of year as well I guess. So much more that I expected. So many stories about the rock and it is soooo big,. not to be missed, you need to experience this magical place yourself to fully appreciate it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru/Ayers Rock is absolutely amazing. If anyone says it's just a rock then they can't have been and experienced it. I am so glad I didn't miss this. We stayed on the Campsite on Ayers Rock Resort as we had our own campervan. We stayed for 3nights/4days so we got to see the rock for Sunrise and Sunset. You must do both of these. Sunset was our favourite time the colour changes in the Rock are out of this world. There is an entrance fee to the rock of 25USD this is for 3 days so great value for money. We also did the Base Walk definitely worth doing we watched the sunrise first then went straight to do the walk as it was slightly cooler still 30 plus degrees but the sun wasn't fully on the rock so wasn't as intense. Do not miss seeing any of this it's amazing.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I learnt a lot during the time I spent at Uluru and in the museum. I learnt about the Aboriginal culture and their legends. It is a very complex culture. And I love the art. Also, the place is a little paradise. There was a little bit of rain, and we were able to see waterfalls on Uluru. It's preserved and beautiful, the green of the grass, the orange-red of the stones. Stunning!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Hot. Tons of flies. Not very interesting. You are taken near the rock before sunset but don't walk on it. There are some parts of the rock that you can't photograph. Wear good walking shoes and don't forget your fly net
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is one very special giant lump of rock. We loved our time in this beautiful, drastically different landscape. We rode retro bikes around the base and our hotel packed us a picnic to take. Check out the Aboriginal ladies working away on their traditional paintings at the cultural center."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We were fortunate to spend 3 days in Ayers Rock and saw Uluru at sunrise, sunset, and we walked around the base in the afternoon on a third day. Our camera doesn't do the vast array of colors justice but we have wonderful memories of this place. Our dinner under the stars was a highlight of our entire AUS/NZ trip. An astronomer lectured about the stars with a laser pointer and it was tremendous! I have never seen the Milky Way before and of course the Southern Cross was great to see. The buffet dinner was delicious and we tried new dishes. The Field of Light: Uluru is extremely unique and special. We were lucky to visit when that exhibit was still there. Thousands of LED lights of different colors come on in the desert at dusk. You have to see it to believe it. The artist, Bruce Munro is a genius. We are so glad we visited!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS REVIEW IS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE AAT KINGS TOUR!!! Uluru / Ayers Rock is something that everyone should go and see sometime in their lifetime. We signed up at the front desk of Desert Sands Hotel and all we got was a paper voucher/receipt and told to give it to our driver the next morning. Paid nearly $300 for the tour which looks as if we spent more than we should have paid, according to the TA pricing shown. The morning of the tour, we arrived early and were waiting in the lobby. We had bottles of water and thought we could refill from the bus as we had on the AAT Kings King Canyon tour a few days earlier. Our ""guide"" for the day had been in the lobby but never announced the tour or mentioned 3 liters of water being required for the base walk. It wasn't until checking in that the water was mentioned. We were told it was in the itinerary that we never received when we purchased the tickets. Of course we were offered the $4 bottles but ran back to the room to get some of the overpriced water we already had bought at the resort. We did a different tour with AAT Kings a few days earlier and that guide continuously announced in the lobby to all that 3 liters of water were required for the canyon tour. This ""guide"" said NOTHING! We went to a viewing area and saw the silhouette of Uluru. We were told by the ""guide"", think his name was Owen but he wore no name tag, that we would go to the rock and see the sun come up over the horizon, which we did not! Once at Uluru, Owen(?) talked a little then he was off and running. Typically throughout this ""guided"" walk, our ""guide"" was at least 100 - 200 meters ahead of us. Most of the group tried to keep up at first but were unable to take any pictures. We, along with a few others, decided to go at our own pace and get pictures. This ""guide"" sees Uluru every day. WE DO NOT! We traveled thousands of miles and paid nearly $300 for this tour so we were not running. Each time he stopped to talk a bit, he would take off running afterwards as if the tourists were an annoyance to him. He told us about sacred sites and no pictures being allowed. However, he was not clearly communicating to us about when you were able to start taking pictures again. My husband took a picture where he thought he was past the sacred area. Owen(?) called him out in front of the group and repeatedly kept saying how offended he was since he was an indigenous person. It was very awkward and uncalled for. My husband was not disrespectful on purpose. It was an honest mistake made because this ""guide"" was not doing his job. What the ""guide"" did was extremely unprofessional and could have been handled in a much different manner. He could have talked to my husband privately and asked him to delete the picture which he would have graciously done. We thought there was supposed to be so much respect for elders among the Aborigine but this person showed no respect for my husband by yelling at him the way he did. At one of the very few times we were together, Owen(?) was listening to another tour guide and seemed to get very angry and upset that this guide got some of the story/legend incorrect. He worked for another company so it was really none of our ""guide's"" business. When asked if he thought there might eventually be more commercialism of Uluru due to the introduction of things such as seaways, Owen(?) was very quick to blame the ""white man"". I believe this is a very angry young man who has no business being in the tourist industry. When dealing with the public, you need to show restraint, respect, have lots of patience and make paying customers feel comfortable. This person has NONE of those qualities. We have been traveling and taking tours/excursions for a very long time. I have always been very fair in my reviews here on Trip Advisor. This ""guided tour"" was one of the worst. AAT Kings - what are you going to do? I feel a refund is in order. Don't you agree? Don't let this review stop you from visiting this fascinating place. Just make sure that you have a good guide, not someone with such a negative attitude."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our whole sunrise and Uluru base walk experience was amazing from very friendly pick up from our accommodation, the informative educational commentary from Alwyn ( this young man is a wonderful ambassador for Uluru, Yulara and AAT Kings.) and our visit to the Cultural Centre. We would highly recommend this tour and this company we had a wonderful day."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Weft at 5:30 am to see the sunrise over Uluru. The coaches drive to an overlook to provide good views. The colours are very subtle and show better in photos than with the naked eye. We were provided biscuits, hot chocolate, coffee and orange juice for breakfast. In the afternoon, we walked around Uluru and visited various caves with indigenous drawings and watering holes. Our sunset tour began at 3:30 pm. We visited the indigenous peoples’ museum then went to a lookout point to view the sunset. We were provided with crisps, cheese, crackers, veggies and dip and sparkling wine while we watched the sunset. Unfortunately it was overcast that evening so we did not receive the full effect of the colours changing around Uluru as the sun set. However, the nibbles were delicious and they were very generous with the sparkling wine."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park is an unique place. When visiting the place, one do more then just appreciate the natural monuments, but dive into the culture of the aboriginal people, the landowners of the place. The Ayers Rock Resort is a complex of four hotels, restaurants and stores with more than enough for your stay. Free shuttle buses will take you to your hotel in ten minutes. I took two different tours with AAT Kings. One on my day of arrival, the Uluru sunset and base walk. The guide Toni, was very acknowledged of the historical and geographical features of the place. At the end of the tour, we could see Uluru change colors tasting a glass of sparkling wine. The next morning I took the Uluru sunrise and Kata Tjuta walk very early in the morning. Again, the guides Glen and Claire did educate us on the aboriginal culture. This had more walking than the precious one, amazing walk indeed. The flies, well, they are part of the environment, just get used to them. Two nights should be enough to experience Uluru Kata Tjuta."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A place I have always wanted to visit and it lived up to expectations. Did sunrise and round base walk with an excellent guide, Olwen. Also did Sounds of Silence dinner which was a great experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our visit here took several days. We went into the park for a general run around to see the area. We went back for a sunset over Ayres Rock. There were a few clouds in the sky at sunset so we didn't see the rock ""light up"" however it was still a lovely evening watching the sun go down. We came back the net morning for the sun rise. We were first there and more spectacular than the sunrise was the sky at night. We saw 2 shooting stars and you could faintly see the Milky Way. It was magical. Only downside is that eventually both sunrise an sunset get very busy after a lot of coaches arrive and it becomes very crowded. Lots of mobile phones and tablets lighting up distract from the sunrise. Our final tip was round the base of Ayres Rock where we saw all the Aboriginal paintings and sacred spots. Very interesting and beautiful."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Went here and watched both the sunset then the sunrise the next morning. If I had to only choose one, I would see the sunset again. The rock itself I would rate a 5/5, I now see why it is so iconically a symbol of Australia. Be aware that it is out ""in the middle of nowhere"" and heavily filled with tourists. Everything is very expensive around here. I found the price per person to get into the park quite steep, and it is disappointing that the climb was closed as well."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A wonderful place to visit. Feel the spirit and understand the culture of the indigenous Australians
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,If you go to Australia and you do not take the time to travel to Uluru you are really missing out. Took a one night trip up from Sydney. Attended the stargazing dinner in the desert. It was very interesting. The next morning my wife and I took a tour that takes you out to Ayers Rock at sunrise. This was an amazing experience. Then there was also a walking tour around the Rock. Hint: Bring a bug net for your head.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Pictures really don't do this place justice. The only disappointment for me is that people are still allowed to climb it and in their ignorance (the local indigenous people ask you not to) they continue to do so. This aside it's well worth taking a walk or cycle ride around the base to basque in its spiritual wonder. My please to you is to leave only footprints and take away wonderful memories
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We stayed for 3 days and watched the sunset at Uluru and Sunrise at Kata Tjuta. The Resort is great which ever accommodation you are staying in with the free shuttle bus around the resort.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visiting Uluru was absolutely amazing and should definitely be on your bucket list. I recommend doing the base walk at sunrise, it was incredible! Also, you MUST watch the sunset from the sunset viewing platform with a glass of champagne or Aussie beer!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My colleague and I hired a car, (great option for us) gave us the flexibility to see Uluru and surrounding area at our own pace."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Wonderful trip to watch the sunrise from the viewing platform then to the base of Uluru to touch it. Only wish we had bought insect nets as the flies are relentless and don't forget water. Would recommend adding Uluru to the bucket list.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One to tick off the bucket list, a great experience from start to end, amazing to see the red centre from the aircraft as we flew in. Picked up from the airport by the complimentary resort coach, nice room with view of the rock and three trips that enhanced the experience including sunrise and sunset trips, Barrie and a helicopter flight over Uluru and Kata Tjuta. All highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is most majestic. The best viewing times are at sunrise and sunset. It gets very full. Please listen to the Ananju people and do not climb! I'd recommend the Sounds of Silence dinner.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayer's Rock now known as Uluru (Aborigine Name) in respect for the Aborigine groups ancient name for the rock. And one is seeing an icon of the world. What is especially good is viewing Uluru by both sunset and sunrise light because the light is reflecting off the surface by so many shades and hues and ever changing( worth the effort to get up early for the sunrise.) A few places around the rock are sacred spaces for the Aborigine group and photographing is prohibited out of respect for the site and the people. Note: be sure to wear a fly net over your face as the flies are terrible. They are seeking moisture and they fly into your eyes and mouth. And some places around Uluru were worse than others for the hoards of flies.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This iconic and sacred landmark certainly exudes some kind of spirituality, a calmness that pervades the park. The small Aboriginal culture centre within the park is worth a visit too."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A long day from Alice Springs to Uluru and back but soooo worth it. It's been on my bucket list for a long time. 680+ miles in a day but the bus was comfortable with frequent stops to see things, eat and stretch one's legs. If you're there during the heat of summer, don't forget a water bottle (which you can refill from a tank on the bus) and don't make fun of people who buy the hats with netting to keep the flies off their face and hair. The flies are relentless. Sunset at Uluru was beautiful and although clouds blocked the sun a bit that day, the effect was breathtaking."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Saw the rock at sunset with wine and canapes and next morning at dawn. Quite impressive. Also had tour around base and into caves. It is an atmospheric place which I,m glad I visited"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The heat can be a concern for many but it is not humid. The 2-hour walk around Uluru under 40 degrees somehow connects me with the past, you feel time has stopped here (especially when you listen to aboriginal music at the same time). It can be really hot but a fairly easy walk. Uluru is fascinating and a charm during sunrise and sunset. The place gives me peace, forget the current world I'm now living in and it's a blessing to be able to see it with my own eyes during my lifetime. I miss this place. It's so beautiful.."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The symbol of Australia, is not just a beautiful piece of nature, but a cultural experience on the local population. The surrounding infrastructure buildings are so well done, you could be forgiven for not knowing they are there. The Cultural Centre is a must visit for a history of the people of this land. We did the Base Walk around the bottom which was 10kms or so long, flat but still a challenge in the heat. The surprise was the waterholes and green areas with trees and birdlife. Such a beautiful place and so very popular with the tourists. Take plenty of water if you do the base walk. And we did NOT climb."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This massive rock (and it IS one rock which tipped on its side millions of years ago - if you look at the picture the sedimentary layers run up and down) is enchanting. Sunset and sun-down are great lighting effects. You will need ""head nets"" for the flies. They don't bite but are an irritating presence."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We had two tours through the Seit company and loved the small group format they offer. The sunrise base walk was awesome and learned so much about the environment and cultural background of this sacred area. I would highly recommend this company.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went there both at sunset and sunrise, and both times were great. But beware that at sunrise there are so much more flies and insects around."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited this wonderful place on a guided tour. We did 2 of the three trips to Uluru. The evening sunset was wonderful to see and the sun was shining without a cloud. The changes on the Rock were hard to see as they were gradual. We were advised to take a picture every 5 minutes and then review them later. That was excellent advice as you can only then appreciate the changes. Of course the wine and snacks helped this to also be a wonderful social event too. A sign in one of the village shops amused us ""Hard Rock - No Cafe"". It is still possible to climb Uluru - but only when conditions are right. However the Aboriginals see this place as sacred - so please don't climb. Respect their wishes. It is here that you will gain a great insight to Aboriginal culture. They live by three themes. Men's business. Women's business. Sorry business. You will be told why this leaves them ill equipped for modern life. One of my bucket list things to visit and not disappointed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is why we came to Uluru is to see Ayers Rock . It's so beautiful at sunrise and sunset . It's massive , so many different views that u can see it . We saw Ayers Rock in every different angle possible. I fell in love . I took the most amazing awesome pics and panoramic shots . But the pics don't do it justice u need to see it for urself . It's a magical place . The colours at sunrise and sunset are spectacular. I highly recommend visiting Ayers Rock by hiring a car and doing it urself and at ur pace . Loved it best experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The place was more incredible than we could have imagined. We walked around the entire base, and it was pretty cool to do, but we decided the best stuff to look at is really about the half of it between the Mala and the Kunija car parks. Just do that as an out and back, or arrange for a bicycle in town to make it a lot quicker. Our walk was 3 hrs 20 min and we started at 7:25am. Be sure to stop in the IGA store and get bug nets for you head. $3 well spent! Might want an umbrella too for when sun is high and HOT.Out of respect for the native people, we didn't climb it, but it was sooo tempting. Leave town early to catch a bit of sunrise and come back before sunset. We got a car which gives you much more freedom..Hey, you're never coming back!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One of the highlights of our 15 day Outback bus trip was visiting Uluru (Ayers Rock). Our AAT Kings guide was well informed and passionate about the area and its history. She instilled in us a respect for the sacred nature of the area. It can be a very spiritual experience if you put yourself in the place of the indigenous peoples who now own rights to the land and these attractions. A small tour is probably preferable than going alone unless you know a lot about the history already. The flies are abundant and annoying - so don't hesitate to wear a fly net - you will have a much more pleasant experience. Be sure to catch the view at sunrise and/or sunset - it is amazing! My favorite pic is of one of the sacred openings - up close. There are some areas that you are not allowed to photograph, but this was not one."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A sunrise visit here is an amazing experience especially if you are lucky enough to catch the Bruce Munroe's Installation as well. Worth the very early get up, 3.15am. We were well looked after and thoughtfully guided. The peace and silence is infectious. Hardly a murmur from anyone. We just all stood and watched and waited in awe. After sunrise there were refreshments provided. Definitely one of the wonders of the modern world."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You have to see it but do not miss exploring the local area - its very surprising. Please don't be seduced into climbing the Rock as it is a sacred place and local Aborigines don't appreciate tourists clambering all over the place.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great time with fantastic scenery, lots to do, see and experience. Staff are friendly and helpful! Take time to add some some of the free and cultural activities. Love the dot painting workshop."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wanted to go my whole life, yes its an expensive trip, but worth it. The real red centre and heartland of our country. Be respectful and opt not to climb Uluru. Make sure to catch at least one sunrise and sunset. Base walk is about 10km and it gets hot quickly so start it after sunrise. Park at the Mala carpark to start the base walk."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Well worth the visit. We did the base walk on an extremely hot day and everything but the last 1/3 of the walk was good. The colours are amazing. The guided tour was good and definitely added to our visit to Uluru.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We absolutely loved our 5 days at Uluru Sunrises and sunsets Walks are amazing and a must do We flew over the rock And we flew over kings canyon My second time to Uluru And I could go again in a heartbeat
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No one can appreciate the real beauty of Uluru until you have experienced it for yourself. Up close and from a distance the Rock is magnificent, I would recommend doing a walk around the base to get up close and personal and experience the history of the people who have called it home for many thousands of years"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Took a base walk and sunset tour with AAT Kings. Brilliant guides and drivers. Really knowledgeable and respectful of the place. Stunning
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Following on from the morning tour, we were again collected at 3.30pm for a tour to the Rock itself, this time my a knowledgeable guide and driver called Gary. We departed on time and taken to a spot where all iconic photographs have been taken over the years. From there we were taken to the rock itself where we were able to go into a small cave and touch the wall. From there we went to where they had a walkway to the top although this is currently closed and told of its construction. Continuing on we walked further around to be shown wall paintings. From there it was onto a viewing platform to see the sunset from behind giving a different perspective of the event whilst sipping sparkling wine. We returned to our hotel at around 8.30pm. It was a well directed and interesting tour with the SE IT Outback Tours."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A must if at all possible. Very early start but well worth it. To see Uluru change colour as the sun rises is awesome. An easy walk nothing too strenuous but it's a long walk. Drink plenty of water. Our guide Brett or he was calling himself B2 was very knowledgeable, had our breakfast half way through the walk looking at Uluru. Amazing experience"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you go to Australia you have to see Uluru (Ayers Rock) . We flew to Urulu do to time restraints and took two tours from the Sails Hotel, the guided tour given by Leroy was wonderful, Leroy was so informative, we toured all the way around Uluru seeing all the cultural sites, a definite must do. We also took the tour to see Urulu at sunset, spectacular, we were also able to buy 3 beautiful paintings made and sold to us by the artists 2 Aboriginal ladys."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The best time to enjoy the view is before and during sunset. Arrive an hour proior to the actual sunset-time. Then you've got enough time to watch the sunset and the changing colours. The cultural centre is nothing special...
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"“The Rock” is stunning and massive and a small group tour with SEIT was the perfect way to explore its history, culture and geology, Our guide Gary was very knowledgable and engaging, recounting the sacred stories associated with the place as we drove around the base, stopping to disembark and walk into caves and visit water holes. We ended the 5-hour Sunset Tour with a sparkling wine toast and great respect for the sacred area."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Breathe taking,wonderful experience,number 1 natural wonder of the planet Earth,have to see at least ones in the life time!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Second visit to the Rock and decided to self drive around the Rock and Kata Tjuta. Walked the 500m of the Mutijula Walk in 39 - 40 degree temperatures in February to the waterhole and well worth the effort. We circumnavigated the Rock by car and we're pleased to see the Rangers had closed all rock climbing due to the temperature. The Cultural Centre and shops near the Rock gave a superb display of the area and indigenous art with artists in residence.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is (unless you are living close) most likely a once ina lifetime thing (bucket list even) so if you are planning on going there it might be a good idea to at least try to got in or after the ""rainy"" season. It gets much enhanced when the landscape around it is not all brown and red And of course the usual Points: Respect Aborigine rules, protect yourself against heat and have enough water with you."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We saw sunrise and sunset the colours of Uluru changed by the minute. You learn about the Aboriginal culture from the centre in the park fascinating.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great views and to get the best experience, take a tour. The stories associating with the Rock gives one a greater respect of the culture and the Aboriginal culture."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Worth hiking around or taking the tour for the Mala walk. Certain areas hold spiritual meaning to the aboriginals and no photograhy is allowed. A very beautiful place.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wanted to see Uluru ever since I saw a picture of the rock. Sunrise, daytime, sunset, the rock keeps surprising from every angle. One of these iconic must have seen places."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It's a long way to go to see but somehow worth it. We saw the rock streaming with water which was fun. So much rain that the park was closed.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Did the base walk of Uluru. Had to start early because it was heading up to 40c on the day. About 2.5 - 3 hour easy walk including The Mala walk. 12km all around the base. Take at least 1 litre of water to drink per hour if going to be hot. There is a water tank about half way if leaving from Mala car park. Wear good walking shoes.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have always wanted to visit Uluru, so when we realised it had a special light exhibition we decided to make that our time to visit. It was extremely hot. Being February. Perhaps something to consider for people not used to the heat (but we thought we didn't have a choice as were told the light exhibition was finishing in March). But it was worth it. Just make sure you get up for the walk around Uluru's base early in the morning. We started at 8.30 and I would've preferred to start earlier (in hindsight) as the heat grew quickly! It's a decent walk around the bottom of the rock. But is flat and easily walked. I think you could easily take a baby buggy made for off road around the bottom! You can also hire Segways if you wish, and they would make your trip around the rock much quicker! You can still climb Ayers Rock, however, the local people request that you don't. After visiting the cultural centre and learning more, we found the desire to climb went. For us it was more important to respect the area, and gain our experience enjoying our time in a more respectful way. Make sure you stop at the sunrise/sunset parking areas for photos. Even if not at those specific times, the vantage points are brilliant and the rock makes for great photography. There are no shops/toilets (one set of toilets at one of the parking areas), so ensure you take enough food/water for the time you're going to be walking. We were told 1 litre per hour and that seemed to work well. And most importantly, take a veil of some sort. I took one of my bee keeping hats, my husband brought a net from the local supermarket (around $7). You need these! The little flies are so annoying! It makes for an unpleasant walk when you are swiping at flies the whole way around. Don't forget to take some time out as you walk around enjoying the scenery and especially remember to turn around and look behind you. We would find it gave us quite a different perspective on many of the times we did this."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Everyone in the world should see this amazing sight!!! we saw the rock at sunrise, during the day and at sunset! from all angles.... brilliant... the base walk is great but make sure you are prepared with water and hats!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Unbelievable site - great to walk around a section. Colours of the rock can vary massively depending on weather. We even saw silver streets where rock was moist - very unexpected
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We loved walking around the largest rock in the world. Why did I rate it as average: 1. The park system does a very poor job of providing information to travelers. 2. On the walk to circumnavigate the rock, there is only ONE water station. 3. No safety information is provided about the signs of heat stroke, what to do, how to deal with it, or the distance between emergency beacons. 4. There are places along the journey were you are asked not to take pictures. But, they aren't really clear because you could literally stand 1 meter before the sign, point your camera in the direction of the rock, and capture the image. 5. There is not good education provided on cultural sensitivity. 6. The park service still allows people to climb the rock! This is a sacred site, climbing should not be allowed. 7. Cultural explanation signs are all written in the past tense. Do people not use Uluru any longer for ceremony? All this being said, it's still worth the visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We really enjoyed our time at Uluru. I was concerned it would be a bit of a tourist trap but it was not. We got picked up on the same day we arrived by the Uluru express which stops and the hotels in the resort. As we left at 1400, it seemed everyone thought it was too hot and we were alone (it was 39 C), what a pleasure!! Amazing, great, exceptional. We were dropped at the waterhole and there was no one, a nice feeling of adventure even though it was on a path, we walked to the Kanju gorge and did not see anyone (as if the mountain was ours for 1.5 hrs). We would highly recommend it but bring enough water, it was indeed hot and they closed the path from the waterhole to the main entrance where the climb starts due to extreme temperatures (it seemed like overkill as we found it much hotter at places that were open...). Anyway, as long as you can get away from big tours and crowds, its amazing. The sunrise is quite crowded so try to walk around to a spot where there are not people in front of you."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For those of you who have visited US National Parks in Utah, Uluru may not be that special of a sandstone formation. The Delicate Arch at Arches has a more stunning shape. The walls of Zion is as massive. And the hoodoos of Bryce are more colorful. However, Uluru is one humongous piece of rock, towering like a mountain over the flat desert plain. It creates many micro ecosystems with its holes in the cliff wall, caves, and waterholes. It doesn't smack you in the face with stunning wonderfulness of a landscape, but if you take the time, it does reveal its majesty and charm. Having your own car would make it much easier and more comfortable to experience the park. There aren't many hiking trails in the park, so you can't just walk everywhere. It is also very hot here in the summer and teeming with black flies that won't leave you alone. Insect mesh is essential. The park entry fee is expensive: $25 per person (NOT per vehicle, as is customary in the US), and it's valid for 3 days."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It's a mind blowing area. Those of you familiar with the southwest of the United States will know what I mean when I say the heat seres your bones and the breeze carries a thousand stories. The sky is an every changing ocean of color and the nights are filled with the universe unfolding.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you visit Australia, there are two things you must see: the Sydney Opera House and Uluru. I took a SEIT tour of Uluru, which had a small bus (and so not many people). It was perfect. I have a bad back and so did the short walk (it is possible to walk completely around Uluru). Our guide was from France, and she was excellent. She shared the Aborigines' stories and explained the rock art found there. Memorable!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing place to visit. Try to go and see it somewhere alone, away from the crowds of tourists. There are lots of viewing platforms around the resort you can find a bit of piece and quiet."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We stayed nearby, so saw Uluru from a distance at first. Then got up to see sunrise from one of the viewing points, but it was cloudy. Luckily, we were here for a couple of nights, so got to see sunrise and sunset again - the way the light changes the colour of the rock is amazing. I also did a helicopter flight - it's a great way to see Uluru and surrounding landscape. If you can afford it, I'd definitely recommend it. We also did the base walk around the rock itself - it's a flat and well marked path around the rock itself - it took us about 2.5 hours for the full 10km. There are certain areas where you can't take photographs so just use your eyes and take in the amazing formations - it's no wonder the rock is sacred to the indigenous people."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is one of the highlights of the trip to central Australia. It is a huge monolith and we joined the hundreds of tourists to see the sunset and sunrise on Uluru. It is beautiful, but there are lots and lots of tourists to contend with."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It had been at least 25 years since my last visit and it was interesting to see where parts of the rock had collapsed due to the water seepage. We did part of the base walk in the afternoon which was too hot to really appreciate everything that our guide was telling us. The sunset viewing location for coaches became full quite quickly so get there early if you can and take a folding chair if you can.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This a spectacular place. The base walk is very easy and you become very aware of the cultural love of this place. The local aboriginal people request that you do not climb it for the safety of yourself and others which I think is a hard thing to defy. I lose respect for anyone who climbs it when they have been requested not to. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Watched the spectacular sunrise at uluru. Was given a breakfast to start the day. Was guided around the base, over 6 miles, with great commentary. This was one of the best tours we had done. It was hot and bring a fly net!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru really is so stunning and the guide we had Was so informative about the Aboriginal beliefs concerning the rock.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time on this tour, excellent knowledgeable guides, we also added in a helicopter tour"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We stayed in the Uluru resort hotel. It was kind of weird that to view the ""rock"" at sunset or sunrise you board busses to the view sites. There, with hundreds of other people, you stand and wait for the sun to shine on Uluru or set on it. They get very little rain there, but the few days we were there it rained and alas we did not see the spectacular sight. But we did get to see something very unusual, rain flowing down the rock. The dinner in the dessert was cancelled due to weather. The highlight of the experience was the walk with an Aborigine up close and personal. Do not climb Uluru, it is considered sacred ground to the Aborigine people."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A very spiritual place to visit. a wonderful experience to see the sunset. Apparently sunrise is even better. Its very green there at the moment having had rain at Christmas.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The amjesty of Uluru cannot be fully appreciated from a far view. Get up close so it can be experienced. Would we return for another visit? Probably not, as I think ""once is enough"" unless one is fascinated by the anthropolgical aspects of the experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Another one to tick off the bucket list. We skipped the tour busses and hired a little SUV for the day. Lucky the sky was overcast which kept the temperatures down for January. Climbing was not allowed the day we visited and I didn't feel disappointed as it is a very demanding climb. More than 35 have died attempting that feat. We could have dome the 10 km walk around the base but we opted to do the drive. We stopped at several spots for closer look of the waterhole and walking track signs. Not too crowded and could avoid the couple of tour busses. Visited the cultural centre and cafe. Prices were as expected at such a remote place, everything does have to be brought in after all. Also drove over to the Olgas, Kata Tjuta but after midday and as the cloud cover had gone the temperature was climbing to 36C so no walking here for us. Aim to visit early if you are after a walk and be finished by 11 am. The cost of the car was actually cheaper than a tour , and more flexible but no commentary. Awesome, vast landscape, very memorable."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a main focus of any trip to Uluru-Kata Tjuta NP and rightly so. I recommend walking rather than driving, wear a hat and sunscreen, take a camera and some sweet and salty snacks plus HEAPS of water and just enjoy the peace."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Rock is so imposing to see close up. A great experience especially close to sunset. Need to judge the weather in the wet, but worth the trip."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I've seen the rock on TV documentaries but nothing prepares you for the stunning reality. Sunrise or sunset or any time in between the rock is amazing. The viewing sites are well located and there is good interpretation and easy walking trails with boardwalks where necessary. An absolute must do.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited on Dec 29th - 3 days after the most terrific rain storm, and when the park had been forced to shut - so we didn't know what to expect............ with only 2 days we packed in all we could - including a sunrise tour of Uluru, and a canyon walk in the Olgas and then a sunset tour and a walk to a waterhole, followed by a starlight bbq. It was an anazing day. The desert was green with vegetation and full of wonedrful flowers , thanks to the 20cm of rain. The waterhole was full, there was some standing water and still some water running off the rocks. Our guide Michael was epic and really informative. We had a brilliant (if exhausting) day. Uluru is one of those once in a lfetime visits and experiences that turns out to be even better than you hope. You MUST visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Caught a sunrise and a sunset, and then went for a midday walk around the Rock. What an absolute stunning sight - photos on the web just do not do this place justice. There are so many colours, textures, shapes and shadows to see that one could spend many a day here, with something different every day. A must see"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Stunning! The waterhole has a mystical feel about it. Must do! I can see why this rock shouldn't be climbed it has a very mystical and sacred feel to it. Visit and respect
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Definitely worth the money to get here. But I don't recommend a tour - you can do this yourself. Rent a car and go to Uluru and the Olgas. Don't bother with the tours - they won't add any value. I took the Rock Tour and paid $350 and regretted it. Go solo.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It will take some time to get there, but it is a must see in Australia. You can book a one-day-trip to Uluru like we did, or you can drive there yourself. You can climb Uluru but the natives don't like it because it is an holly place. there are also walks around the huge red rusty rock."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"From my first glimpse of Uluru from the plane I was awed by the sheer beauty of this location. Over a period of a few days we were able to see the colours change at sunset, and to explore the perimeter with the excellent guides from AAKings. I was fascinated by the cave paintings and in particular the imprint of the hand; one cannot fail to be considerate of the cultural heritage and significance of Uluru. A must see."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We have been blown away with how stunning Uluru is. After the heavy rains earlier in Jan the red centre has turned green. The colour contrasts are beautiful. It's hot so best to head out early so you can get back to your accommodation in the middle of the day. Do everything you can while you are here. See as many sunrises/sunsets/walks/helicopter rides. Whatever you can. The rock changes every time you see and is stunning from every perspective.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Amazing place...good vibes and amazing atmosphere... Get un and see the sunrise in this national park is amazing
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Got there for 8am via the free shuttle bus and walked round Uluru which took about 2hrs, On the day we visited it rained which though it makes you feel sticky does keep the numerous flies away and gave us some fantastic photos of the waterfalls off the 'Rock' that occur with heavy rain."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I went in a 24hr tour from Alice springs to uluru. The tour was very tiring but it was worth it. Good value for what you get and you get to visit ayers rock at a very low cost cause accommodation in Alice Springs is way cheaper. Staff was very friendly and funny.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Best to go at sunrise if you want to have a walk around (mostly flat and on pathways) the rock, otherwise the midday heat makes it a tough walk. A guided tour is well worth the money."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Worth the journey but a long way to travel if you are in OZ for a limited period 2 to 3 weeks.Recommend Olga's and Kakadu National park. If in Sydney Blue mountains 2 hours train out the city good fr a couple of days to get feel of the outback isolation with good accommodation.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The stories. The history. The fauna. The cave drawings. 2nd largest monolith in Australia which is actually vertical with several miles of it under ground! Checked off the bucket list!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We went here with our group. We went twice - once at sunset & again the next morning. You must be very respectful of the spiritual nature of the area - don't take pictures where they tell you not to. Wear fly nets - the flies are friendly and don't bite. Sunset was beautiful.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow, what an amazing experience. I highly recommend getting up early and doing the whole walk around the rock which takes 3-4 hours. With a quick rush of rain that began pouring we had the opportunity to watch water fill at the top and run down in multiple different spots as waterfalls! Amazing :)"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There is something special about Uluru, the huge piece of monolithic rock in the middle of Australia’s red centre. It’s easily recognised through the thousands of post cards and calendars that flood the souvenir shops and from a distance that’s what it looked like – a post card photograph. Close up however it’s a different story. It is towering, brilliant and iron red and somehow peaceful and menacing at the same time. The first thing you realise about Uluru is the fact that the rock is miles from anywhere – a six hour bus ride from Alice Springs or a very expensive plane flight. There were day trips to the rock and back, but the thought a 12 hour return journey was too much. We opted for a two day trip with an overnight at Uluru. That way we would get to see a sunset and a sunrise. But we hit a snag just before we left. Most of the trips leave the Alice on Monday and Wednesday at 6.30 in the morning. We had booked our onward flight to Darwin on Virgin and the once a week flight left Thursday morning. We booked that rather than the trip on Qantas which cost twice as much on the other days. We arrived in Alice Springs on Monday at lunchtime, so that was too late and the Wednesday trip arrived back after our flight left. It took a lot of chasing but finally we found a Tuesday trip by AAT Kings through Metro Travel: Australis Inbound Tours & Travel. The snag here was they had no accommodation left. Rooms in Yulara village at Uluru are scarce and very expensive. We did manage to find a place – a sparse bunk bed room with shower at the Outback Pioneer Lodge for $265 for the night. It was the last room in town! So at 6.25 am, bleary-eyed, we left the Chifley Hotel and climbed on board the coach. It was a comfortable coach, with plenty of room for legs and hand-luggage and onboard toilet. Thanks to an informative and amusing driver and a couple of stops along the way those six hours passed pretty quickly. Breakfast was at the Camel Farm. There was not a lot to see, but the short camel rides were popular – my wife took one, but I resisted the temptation. The next stop for a morning tea break was more interesting. It was at the Mount Ebenezer Roadhouse and Art Gallery, an historic staging post with plenty to look at around the walls. The art gallery too was great with many fine aboriginal paintings and artefacts at very reasonable prices. In fact if you intend to buy paintings or souvenirs on a similar trip, I would recommend buying them at Mt Ebenezer as similar items are much more expensive at Uluru. We arrived around 1 pm at The Outback Pioneer complex, grabbed a spot of lunch in the fascinating Yulara Square before being picked up by the coach for the drive to Uluru itself. This was an amazing trip. The red centre was green. Recent downpours had transformed the arid landscape into a garden of plants and shrubs that were vivid with masses of bright flowers. It was a rare and stunning landscape. We soon saw Uluru, the picture postcard distance shot. Close up it was magnificent; the colour nothing you could imagine and the weather-hewn contours so smooth and unearthly. It’s no wonder it is a sacred site for Aborigines. The coach took us all the way round the base of the rock and, after a short and easy walk to the beautiful Mutitjulu Waterhole it was on to view Aboriginal rock paintings. The driver was on hand to talk about Aboriginal and European history of Uluru and learn about native flora. It was a tour that taught me a lot about the first Australians and a not so primitive culture. They knew about the dangers of radiation from uranium long before we did. There was more info and art at the Kata Tjuta Cultural Centre. Then we set off in the twilight for the Uluru sunset viewing area. Now this was terrific as we stood drinking champagne and nibbling on canapés watching the sunset rays settled on the rock and we saw the legendary colour changes as darkness slowly settled in. It was an experience not to be missed. There was a bush barbecue as an added extra, but we passed it up and ate at the hotel so we could have an early night and get ready for the sunrise the next morning with a 5 am start. It was cold and we shivered as the saw the first rays of the sun hit the rock. But it was nowhere near as impressive as the sunset and I was glad to back onto the bus for the journey to mystical domes of Kata Tjuta. Again these amazing formations were a joy to see and then we stopped at the base of Walpa Gorge. The trail follows the natural creek between two of the tallest domes of Kata Tjuta. I found it hard going over broken pebbles and a steep incline. But it was an impressive sight. By around 10.45 we were back at the Pioneer Lodge and within minutes the room cleaners were there to tell us checkout was 10 am and roust us out of the room! With threats of being charged an extra night we hustled around and checked out. Then, with our coach for Alice Springs due at 1 pm we found we couldn’t even get a beer because we were no longer hotels guests. Talk about catch 22. But e coach arrived on time and we were on our way back to Alice Springs, tired but filled with memories of a fascinating and informative trip. The cost was $650 per person, which I thought was excellent value. 1300 664 883 is the number for Metro Travel: Australis Inbound Tours & Travel. ."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing experience. It's only a rock, but when you walk around the base of it, you feel this eerie calmness. Sunset & sunrise were both simply amazing. Allowed to climb the rock but locals find it extremely disrespectful. Hence, I encourage all travellers not to climb it. Climb Kilimanjaro or Mt Fuji if you want to climb something that bad!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did the AAT Kings Base Walk and Sunrise tour. The tour guide, Alwyn, really made this tour particularly special. He is an aboriginal man and although his country is in another part of Queensland his connection to the land and deep understanding of the culture and love of sharing it with people made this a precious and meaningful visit to Uluru. He shared many stories and a great deal of knowledge about the importance of the site to the local Ananangu people and showed us beautiful places - including a water hole and lots of caves and rock paintings. The sunrise was gorgeous - just like the postcards. Unfortunately, we were only able to do 3 km of the walk as much of the track was still closed after the flood on 26 December. On the upside, it was much greener and than usual and full of animals (we saw 3 tawny frog mouth owls)."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Because of the Boxing Day rains most of the walking tracks around the rock are closed due to damage and will be for sometime. I did the Mala walk which was beautiful and well worth the time. It is best scheduled early morning as in the afternoon there is very little shade, and it is the only walk open when the temperatures get too high. It was a very bad idea to catch the 2pm bus out as there is no way to return until 4.30pm which was hellish on a 40C day. Service would be greatly improved by having more frequent buses, but at least the driver showed us where to find the shade shelter, water refill, and toilets."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What an experience. When I dreamed of Australia I thought of Uluru. So different to anywhere else with bright cooper red desert sand beneath your shoes and unusual looking, inquisitive animals. We had less than 2 days to visit the area on our Australian trip and we visited towards the 3rd week of February. After our flight arrived several hours later than expected due to being diverted, on arrival at our hotel (The Outback Pioneer) we purchased a tour direct through our hotel reception desk, for the following day. I would love to see Uluru again and if so, I would recommend booking in advance or perhaps exploring the area without a tour as other reviews have suggested which sounds absolutely amazing. On a practical level, we found a fly net was a must as soon as you arrive outside your hotel you are met with them, but everything adds to the experience and we could not have experienced something so different travelling from Sydney the previous day. We chose to do a joint Kata Tjuta guided group tour, walking between the Olgas and up to the Walpa Gorge, followed by viewing Uluru at the main viewing point at sunset. We found completing both areas tiring in one day and not sure how we survived the intense heat between the Olgas but made a superhuman effort to trek onwards and reach the Walpa Gorge and make use of our limited time. On moving onwards it was great to finish with Uluru at sunset. Visiting Uluru to me was what Australia is at its heart, literally the red centre, and I'm so glad we had the opportunity to travel there."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a great presence. A 350,000,000 year old rock set in a vast flat plan. The only thing spoiling this is an overly sensitive film of crap over everywhere. Don't walk up this, don't look at that, don't photograph this bit of ancient and awesome rock that surely no one in their right mind can be so mistaken as to presume they have any rights over it compared to the next man. So, stick to the well worn path, pull your neck In and quietly enjoy it knowing it will still be here when everyone has long passed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is the Red Centre of Australia. Many foreigners know of the main Uluru rock which stands up out of the earth, and lots of tourists visit the sun rise and sunset viewpoints. These are good - but are crowded which is fine if you are happy with that. After our sunrise experience we drove to the other side for an up close walk to the big rock - which helps us appreciate how awesome the rock really is. Because we arrived early, circa 06.30 am we had a fairly uncrowned experience. If you want an even better experience visit the Olgas - or as they are properly called Kuta Tjuta range of huge rocks. Personally I found them even better - especially the walk into the canyon which goes more than 0.5 Km into the rock. Truely awesome - compare well with great places I have visited in the Himalayas. A practical tip: you can go on the guided tours at fairly high cost. If there are 2 or more of you it's more cost effective to hire your own car and it cost just 25 Aus entry per person for 3 days to the Park, plus the petrol. Importantly your own vehicle gives you flexibility about timing, length of time in each spot. A final thought - the various guidebooks all say the indigenous people would prefer us not to climb Uluru. I respect that and would recommend you not to climb out of respect for the people who lived here long time before white man landed in Australia."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you are visiting Australia or live here and have not seen / visited Uluru then you have missed a lot. It was an experience beyond words. We travelled from melbourne to uluru by road , though it was long trip but must do once in life trip. Standing near Uluru gives you a spiritual experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went for the sunrise and base walk tour and it was awesome. The view of the sunrise was so beautiful and we were also provided with a breakfast bag with an apple, granola bar, mixed nuts, cereal and juice. The base walk is on flat road so it's not challenging at all. It was also right after the sunrise, when the temperature was cooler so it was very enjoyable. Just make sure to bring a fly net if you're bugged by flies as there were so many of them during the sunrise viewing and walk."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayres rock is an amazing site to see. Disappointed we weren't able to climb it due to 'summer season' but we did get close enough for photos.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's quite a place and lives up to the reviews. Don't miss the ranger guided Mala walk, it gives a good insight into the local indigenous culture and history and the geology. A must do is the sunset, it's truly amazing how Uluru changes colour as the sun sets. Wear good shoes, drink plenty of water as well. We visited in summer. Getting up to 40 degrees means it can be a bit rough doing too much."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There are so many things to do near and around Uluru, something to suit every level of interest and fitness. We were amazed constantly how big it was, from any angle that we saw it, and how it sits there upon the landscape drawing all eyes to it. I could have looked at it all day. To get into the National Park you need to buy a parks pass, which lasts 3 days (you can buy at the entrance to the park as you drive in, or pre-purchase). We paid $65 for a family. We went in early one morning to watch the sunrise over Uluru - it was magnificent. There were a lot of people there and it would pay to arrive early to get an unobstructed view - we came just before sunrise so walked around to find a good spot and had a few trees in the way but it was still amazing. We returned later in the day to do the base walk. This is a long walk (about 10km) and would be extremely hot on a sunny day, we were lucky and had overcast weather, it would be best to start early in the morning to beat most of the heat. There are a few water fountains around the track so you can top up water bottles. The rock is so varied and interesting all the way around, so many different aspects of it to see, and the foliage around the base varies greatly as well. There are areas which are sacred and the local people request that no photos be taken there - there are plenty of places where photographs are allowed so it's easy to respect their wishes and still record the trip. There is a guided walk each morning to part of the rock, which explains a lot of the significance of the area. We didn't do this but friends who did said it gave them a greater insight to the area. The visitors centre has a cultural discovery centre which gives some of the history of the area and is fascinating. The gift shop has lots of local art and products for sale, and at times the artists are there working on their paintings which was great to watch. It is also possible to ride bikes around the base, my husband and daughter returned the next day and did the ride and found it so much quicker and a very fun way to explore Uluru. We also came back to watch the sunset, there are dedicated carparks to get the best view. it was still cloudy so the colours were not as brilliant as sometimes seen, although the sun popped out for about 30 seconds to bathe Uluru in an amazing orange light, it was incredible. The park closes at a specific time each night (depending on when sunset is) - there are no overnight stays allowed in the park, so make sure you are out before the gates shut."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Some of the trail was washed out due to recent rains, however the walk was lovley and took many photos. I also recommend going to the cultural center!! If doing this in the summer start as early as possible! We started at 0630am, by 1000 it was so hot it was miserable, and by 1100 many of the trails are closed because it was more than 36 degrees out. (Was 41). Lastly, please respect the beliefs of the aboriginal peoples, please do not climb Uluru or photograph the sacred areas. I feel they have been gracious enough by letting us impose."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru and it is just like the postcards. We took the Desert Awakenings Tour in the morning one day, the Field of light tour one evening and the no charge ranger guided Mala walk which left from the Mala car park at 8am another day. All of the tours were good but we enjoyed the ranger guided walk the most, mainly because an Aboriginal guide provides the best perspective of this sacred site. Our recommendation is that Australian should visit this place at least once in a lifetime. If you are going to visit, avoid the hottest months and if you are going for a walk, the best time is early in the morning. Take lots of water, sunscreen and Aerograd! Finally, we chose to respect the place and didn't climb the rock!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Really good for what is essentially just walking around a rock. Although it is an expensive walk, i thought it was well worth it. Would have been massively missing out if i hadn't gone with a guide."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We did the sunrise hike around Uluru with Breakfast included. It was great to have a guide who arranged the walk to maximize Sunrise and minimize direct sunlight later in the morning. Breakfast was a nice touch. Recommend a bug net as they can be very annoying. Very enjoyable morning.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,If you are in this part of Australia and you don't stop here then you're crazy. See it at dawn and dust if the sun is out to see it's amazing colors.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our tour was right after the big rains they had at Christmas and although half the base walk was closed we had a great time. Our bus driver Nigel was enjoyable and funny to listen to and our guide Tyson was excellent. His knowledge of the area and the stories he was able to tell us left us wanting more. I highly recommend both these young men as they made the morning really enjoyable, even if part of the walk was closed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A must for travellers in Australia because of the scenery but also for being aware of the life of the aborigines
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Kata Tjuta (The Olgas) are really worth the trip. If you stay at Uluru, expect fairly high prices for everything, but not too surprising given the remote location. We were there over Christmas with record rains and there were spectacular views of waterfalls on Uluru. The park was closed for a period and then some of the walks closed. Communication about these closures was poor and inconsistent. For example, at the national park entry on 28 Dec it said the valley of the Winds was open, but on driving out there the walk was closed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had a great time watching the sunset on Ayers Rock. I believe the sunrise trip may provide better color changes, but no regrets as this was an experience of a lifetime."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What is Uluru? It’s a rock in the middle of the desert, but not just any rock. Probably the most iconic site in Australia aside from the opera house, Uluru is a large sandstone monolith described by geologists as a inselberg, or “island mountain.” It literally rises out of the desert and changes color at various times of the day and with different weather. How can it be visited? You essentially have two options: a guided tour or a self-tour. There are a number of the former options available (see my separate review of Desert Awakenings) from small groups to large buses, all with their own positives and negatives. A self-tour requires a car and admission fee to the National Park; you are then allowed to explore on your own. I guess I would add a third option of flying over it, although I’m not sure if this counts as a “visit.” Did you climb it? Um, no. There were two reasons for this: the Anangu respectfully ask that you don’t, and almost 40 people have died trying. Our guide told us several stories about hikers straying from the (non-beaten) path and breaking various bones, which was enough. How is the infrastructure around the site? Decent. There are well kept walking paths around the entire monolith (“base walk”), including a number of storyboards that highlight appropriate rock formations, fauna, flora, and rock paintings among others. A number of car parks are available for those independent travelers, along with a somewhat mediocre cultural center that really functions more as a shop for aboriginal art. Bathroom facilities are sparse. How would you recommend visiting? If I had to do things over again, I’d probably do an independent tour at sunrise around the entire base walk. Nothing would give you a better experience about the structure itself, and there’s enough information along the way to obviate the need of a guide. Things start to heat up well before noon so that’s a good time to visit the cultural center. Any other tips or advice? A full day is probably good enough for most; there’s really only so much time you can spend here. Staying out of the sun is in everyone’s best interest. As above, I’d skip the climb and consider an independent excursion."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,No one can prepare you for your first sighting of this magical and magestic rock. It is incredibly impressive and defies all your expectations. The changing colours are fantastic and you need to see it at sunset and sunrise to truly appreciate its beauty.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We only did the small walk at the Rock ..you can walk around it 9.6ks but when you get close to the rock you feel it's spirit especially in the swimming hole area...this place is amazing and we went there three days in s row
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"During our recent visit, the forecast called for rain and rain on vacation is never good - but not if you are at Uluru. As the park ranger stated - everyone comes for the sunrise and sunsets which can be spectacular but few see the unbelievable waterfalls created when it rains. From small quiet falls to a roaring 200 foot falls. Absolutely amazing site. I would strongly recommend renting a car to tour / visit the park. This provided us the opportunity to take advantage of this rare event. Having a car also allows you to be a contrarian - view the sunrise from the sunset viewing area and view the sunset from the sunrise area. I know it sounds crazy but I guarantee you will get a unique and interesting views. One more recommendation - if you visit in December, flies are very abundant and annoying. Buy a net to cover your head - you will not regret it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A most beautiful and cultural holiday, the best way to take it all in is to walk around the base. It is against cultural beliefs to climb and people need to be reminded of that!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We spent the first day doing the ranger walk and talk. Found it very informative and also the teachings of the elders to the younger children is good. We were requested not to photograph certain areas due to cultural sensativity. Which we respected. We went through to the other areas which were lovely. After the tour we returned to the car and went for a drive around the other side of the rock. Where we went past people clearly walking past the signs of sensitivity and taking photographs of these areas which we were appaled at. We returned to Uluru after Christmas lunch and went for a walk around to the other side of the rock. and as soon as we reached the swimming hole area is started to bucket down with rain and we got some amazing photos and it turned out to be a very rare event with the amount of water that was coming down the sides and creating the most spectacular sight we have seen for a long time. It was worth getting drenched for. We hope to return in October 2017 for our wedding anniversary.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"OK, to be fair, no one can predict the weather. Awful night for Uluru base and sunset tour with AAT Kings. Sunset toast and snacks were unsanitary. No plates, no tongs, no toothpicks. People digging into chips, veggies, cheese with their hands. No tables to put drinks as you ate. Terrible, unsanitary setup. No place to sit. Had to ask for a fabric stool."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One of the natural wonders in the world. Spiritual, Amazing, and mind blowing. Place to connect and not to conquer. Please do not climb. If you live in Australia this is a place you must see."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Magical place very interesting learning about aboriginal history and their fight to get back what was theirs
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Wow leaving at 4.30am was worth it to see the amazing sunrise. The changing colours were fantastic. Went with AAT Kings and Sam and Reece were knowledgable and experienced.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited the park not only for great sunsets, but also enjoyed the entire base walk at Uluru. It was interesting to read the details on many of the information placards posted along the walk and to see evidence of the people who lived here in the past. As you walk around you can see that each side does look a bit different with it's own unique characteristics, so it's definitely worth doing. I'd highly recommend the walk if you are able. We did not climb Uluru out of respect for the Aboriginal culture."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I believe it depends on the traveller and what it is you're looking to get out of it. Is it a bit packaged and expensive? Yes, but it's the only way to see it as it is in the middle of the desert. Personally, I loved it. We booked with Uluru Travel and paid $1310 por 2 pax, arriving on Nov 22nd at 1pm and leaving Nov 24th at noon. The package included p/u at airport, 2 night lodging at Emu Walks Apt, Field of Light tour, Sunrise & Kata Tjuta tour and Base and Sunset tour, all tours with guide, and return coach to airport. Quick general impresions. Field of Light tour. I was told to bring a flashlight as it is quite dark and desorienting. Didn't help. The problem is that though you follow the paths there comes a point where you're unsure how far you're going or have gone as there are no signs or any indications. I guess so as to not interfeare with the art work lights but still, you feel rather lost at times. Still, amazing how huge the exposition is. ATT Kings Coaches ok in general though bad experience with the Sunrise & Kata Tjuta tour. All coaches leave from the same place, the Desert Garden hotel which can be a bit caos as each is from a different operator and will help you little if you are in doubt. Our coach arrived about 15min late and nobody had any information about it. The driver and guide (named Ken? Not sure) seem bored with the whole thing and had a slow and really low manner of speaking that put you to sleep. Despite that watching the sunrise over Uluru was awesome. Return to the resort and you can choose pool time or different activities. And thank goodness for the guides in the Base & Sunset tour, Charlie & Ris, really made a difference. Animated, informative, you really got the feeling they knew and loved their job. The weather didn't hold up for the sunset but they were so nice, the people in the tour didn't really mind. I wasn't sure when I booked the tour if it would be worth it but I really was very glad to have done it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,An incredible place! Great place to walk around very early in the morning! Forecast was a bit misty so we did not see any proper Sunset or sunrise but it was amazing!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The ""rock"" is mammoth and a must do. Unfortuneately commercialism is taking over. The sunrise and sunset rave is conditional on the weather, I believe much better viewed in the heat of the day - no shadows but that is a personal preference. One can not review nature, the people promoting the tours however need to give a bit more time and silence would be nice at times."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We visited Uluru for the first time and it was magical. We bought our pass for three days and enjoyed every minute. We walked the base which is an easy walk and worthwhile. We went and watched the sunset and went out to watch the sunrise. The viewing areas are well set up and the walking track around the base is an easy walk and well marked. It is discouraged to climb the rock but still can be done if the weather is right. Will be going back again.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Its more then just a rock its mammoth and lots of walks take you into the nooks and crannys viewing ancient paintings waterholes and the sheer cliffs-We found it very mystical
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Jeff was our driver who picked us up on time and collected us at the designated hour. He was extremely knowledgeable and we learnt even more history on the trip to Uluru. We found this to be an easy way to see the area to fit in with our other schedules.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I would recommend hiring a tour guide who can share information about Uluru and its history. The sunrise is more impressive than sunset.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Amazing to finally see it. Saw it at sunset and sunrise. You need to get up very early to get to the sunrise point but it is worth it to see this famous rock.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Defintely an experience that you won't forget. Rock formation thousands of years old in the middle of a desert area. A connection with mother earth
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When doing the full lap, here's a big tip for you - hire a bike for the little ones. Cuts down on the whinge-factor and takes the complaints further away from you! We hired bikes for our 8 and 13 year old and it made the experience much better. Given that it took us about 3 hours to do the full loop of about 12km with detours (taking it at moderate pace with rests, reading stops and snapping many photos). Also, make sure you do the walk early in the morning to avoid the heat and another tip would be to use the shade of Uluru whilst its there. This means if doing it from the Mala carpark side, do it clockwise. If wanting to do a shorter version of the walk where you get to see all the good bits, do the Mala Walk and you'll get the highlights tour. Amazing rock features and a waterhole in the desert! The Kuniya walk is also a quickie tour if you are running out of time and want to see some rock art and a waterhole. If you want to climb it - don't hold your breath. Actually you probably should, because the extra wind you create will likely shut it down because the wind meters are very sensitive there! Make sure you read the opening hours if you are not there in peak season, and if inclined to go to the top, check at the entrance what time the ranger makes the call on wind - it might save you some sleep. Oooh yeah - another thing - we were there for 4 days so if you ask nicely they will extend your 3 day pass for free on the 3rd day. Make sure you do the sunset car park - this was spectacular to the point of almost looking fake! Its not like you are going to come here and not do Uluru, but this might be useful if you are short of time (or energetic kids!). Enjoy."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It's a huge red rock in the middle of nowhere that is somewhat majestic with its larger than life size and color. It was raining when we landed. Needless to say not something you appreciate when on vacation. The staff member that met us at the airport was extatic for the rain- so were the locals. Rain is so rare here that very few see it. Apparently the rain forces the bloom of plants that almost never bloom. The coolest thing about the rain as it made it appear the rock was crying. It didn't rain for the remainder of the trip so walking/ hiking around the rock was outstanding. In fact just relaxing and sipping cocktails gazing was quite comforting.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,you will need to book a tour or hire a car to get close to this amazing sight but it well worth it - you need to be close enough to feel the magnitude of this natural wonder
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes, it's a long way to Yulara and Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park. Yes, it is hot as heck out in the desert (100 deg F during my visit). Yes, there are pesky flies everywhere. However, watching Uluru change color from a dull sandstone brown to a brilliant fiery red at sunset makes it all worthwhile. An experience that will be etched in your memory for a long time. Also, spending some time learning about the significance of Uluru to the Anangu people enhanced my respect for this ""rock""."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What a great place I have travel all over the world and seeing Uluru would be in my top 5 Our Resort near by was only a 3 star but I am sure one of the others would be better but like every thing you pay to get the better ones We hired a car as there was 4 of us and we were on a budget so the payed tours seemed very expensive .
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was not expecting a lot prior to visiting Uluru. It is huge, majestic and spectacular. Have seen many places on earth including Everest, Machu Piccu, but I think this tops them all."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Loved Uluru. There is something about this place, great views, great walks and nothing beats sunrise and sunset here"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A must-see for all Aussies and tourists alike; so majestic you cannot but be in awe; The walk around takes about 4 hours & a fly net is a necessity. Out of respect for the aboriginal people it is better not to climb it;
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"All the reviews will tell you how visually stunning and breathtaking Uluru was. And they are all correct - majestic, spiritual, stunning. Definitely a once in a lifetime sight to see! However, what I didn't learn about until the day before I arrived are how annoying the flies are. Admittedly I don't like bugs, and it felt like the flies were on biblical plague levels. Less than a day after arriving I got a mosquito/fly net hat and wore it faithfully because the flies are everywhere while the sun is up and leading a bit into sunset. We first arrived at the rock around 4pm, and it was unbearable. I felt like I couldn't stand and take everything in because I was swatting constantly and trying to avoid getting some unwanted protein (as several people had swallowed flies). All of that aside, Uluru is an amazing and majestic force of nature!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is an iconic place and of great spiritual significance to the Aboriginal people. It is a well organised place to visit with a proper respect given to its importance. It is well worth visiting and the Sunrise and Sunsets are a delight for the photographer.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There is something magical about the sheer presence of Uluru and it is no surprise it is one of the top places in the world to visit. Its size and ancient links with the aboriginals are awesome as are the changing colours especially at sun rise. There is a walk round the base which takes about 3 hours and best undertaken as early as possible as it gets extremely hot. There is a continuing debate about whether to climb the rock itself, it is not actually banned (yet) but the authorities regularly close it due to weather as was the case on our visit. I was lucky enough to visit in 2004 and there seem to be lots more restrictions in 2016 than existed in 2004, eg the base walk in parts is hundreds of metres from the rock whereas in 2004 you could pretty well follow the true base so today you miss on some amazing sights. There are also lots of signs asking you not to take photos. There is a balance to strike as too many restrictions may deter visitors and this is not an easy or cheap place to get to."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had a whirlwind tour in Japan, New Zealand and Oz and we saw some amazing places and did some great things, however for me, the bets place by far was Uluru. It is difficult to describe how beautiful it is close up and personal and the local stories, legends and teachings all add to the mystical beauty of it all. Watching the sun go down here was one of the best moments of my life, it was that good. I would do it on a daily basis and not get bored of it. The helicopter tour of Uluru and Kata Tjuta was out of this world, having experienced both at ground level, to see them from the air was jaw dropping. I usually try and note some 'area for improvement' on my reviews to give a balanced view however I don't have any for this place. The only thing I would say is that in about 60 years time when the lease runs out, I hope the local people take it back from the government and either run it for themselves, their own benefit, or better still close it down as an attraction and let the people/land/nature have it back for good. We tend not to go back to places we have been because there is so much to see in the world, however I would go back to Uluru tomorrow."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Have visited this marvelous sight quite often. Always strikes me as something very special. Do not miss sunrise and sunset - but even more attractive is a walk around the rock. Clockwise from Mala car park - you cannot get (closer) to the rock, cannot appreciate it more than on such a walk. Start very early - best right after sunrise... breakfast can wait till later! Bring water, an apple or something to nibble. The whole walk will take approximately 2,5 - 3h. It's worth it! PS. PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CLIMB THE ROCK. The traditional owners of the land do wish their rock to be respected - not climbed!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My first time to the Red Centre to see Uluru but it will not be the last. The colours change so often, making for so many unique photo opportunities. However, I found that if you watch it at sunrise, you would not need to watch it at sunset. The views you get are the same. During the day, do spend some time driving around the rock and getting a closer look at it. You will be surprised!!!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We don't get wrapped up in the native beliefs related to this place, but the geology and scope of it is truly amazing. When seen from a distance it caused excitement. The walk around it is quite lengthy, but allows for a nice walk and some good and interesting views. It is a must-see when coming to Australia and especially the outback."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru, The Olgas and Mt Conner are all so amazing. Your first impression is WoW! how did this occur. Uluru actually on its side. Great to walk around the 10.4Kms or bike ride."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have to admit, my expectations of Uluru were exceedingly low prior to going. I only went because family was visiting and it was on their bucket list of things to do. As it turns out, it was an amazing experience that I can't believe I hadn't done before. The park itself was nicely laid out, with all kinds of viewing areas (sunset and sunrise) for those driving. We did the base walk, and were lucky enough to have an overcast, 28 degree day (I can't imagine doing it when it is 40 and sunny!). It took about 3 hours and was wonderful. The park costs $25 pp for a 3 day pass, and considering we went there three days in a row, was well worth it. The cultural centre was also worth a visit! Will visit again."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is magical, colourful, full of history and mystery. The rock structure is geologically unique."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just how you would imagine it, the sunset car park is a must, and the walks round it brilliant. Just remember it's going to cost a lot of money to get there."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Been there ticked that off the list, amazing piece of Australia. Traveling around the world all Australians should take a look in the back yard as well. We could have done the experience in 24 hours but 72 hours was a good break."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I highly recommend walking up close to the rock, going to all the look out points, driving around it...everything. See a sunrise or two, a sunset or two...it's all beautiful and different from every angle."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Every one should visit this amazing monolith in the centre of Australia just to see how really big it is. I did a helicopter flight and the base and sunset tour with AAT Kings. The tour guide/driver's talks were very interesting and informative and I was impressed with the way they pronounced the Anargu language
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What a wonderful experience! would highly recommend Uluru for anyone looking for Natural beauty with a Cultural Background!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went to Uluru and Kata Tjuta in August, during the Australian winter. Still plenty warm, the most we needed to wear were jackets. But the crowds were minimal, and we couldn't have been happier. This is a magical place, well with the trip. Try to have AT LEAST 3 days to see it, more would be nice if you can."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru deserves it's status as a world must see sight. Best visited as sunset or sunrise. Summer is hotter but bearable (desert summer nights are bearably cool) and there are fewer other tourists.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you visit the Red Centre a visit to Uluru (formerly Ayers Rock) is a must-do. The shape and colors are beautiful, especially at sunset or sunrise. Great. I went there on a tour but saw some people doing it with their own rental car. The road from Alice-Springs is paved. But it still is a 5 hours drive. Btw. You can still climb to the top (it is not prohibited, except for weather conditions). But in respect to the aborigines it is frowned upon."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru in October, driving to and from Alice Springs. It took about 5 hours with stops on the way to visit roadhouses, the best was Stuarts Well. We spent the night at the Desert Gardens Hotel in a Uluru view room. We took a 4 hour sunrise tour of the Olgas (4:45am departure) and a 5 hour sunset tour of Uluru (3:30 pm departure). Both tours were with Seit Outback Australia. The groups were small (ten), the walks fairly easy, the guides knowledgeable, the food and drink good - overall excellent. The The small group tours seemed better than the large coach tours as the guide and the attractions are more accessible."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,5 stars! Would recommend it all ages young and old. Relatively easy going walk. I have health problems and was looked after kindly.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went with Intrepid Tours on the Rock to Rock 2 night camping experience. Very well organised with drives through the hottest part of the day and walks early in the morning. We drove first to Kings Canyon and camped out under the stars, the moon was so bright I thought someone had left a light on! Then it was back to Uluru up at 4am for the self guided walk around the base so interesting and an easy walk. The sun setting on the rock was fab especially with a glass of champagne! Its possible to leave your luggage at the resort so you can just take a small bag for your tour. We were restricted to 15kilos. Best to travel light anyway as internal flights bag allowance isnt as large as international flights."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It's an impressive bit of rock and looks nice at sunrise or sunset. It's the part it plays in Aborigine culture that makes it interesting. You just have to do it as part of the adventure to the Red Centre
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There are a few choices, a long walk very early in the morning, hmm not for us, a quite expensive bike ride around the base, OK but very hot. car hire to drive around stopping at the highlights..yes great idea and you can then return for the sunset experience which is much better than sunrise, much longer! Also can drive 40km further to the Olgas. But definitely take heaps of water and drink very frequently."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited in a motorhome staying at the Ayres Rock Resort. We drove independently to the Rock and had the most incredible experience. There are lots of packages on offer from the resort, special dinners, helicopter flights over the Rock, coach tours, even parachuting out over the Rock... To be honest just being there next to the Rock was enough for us, the cultural centre which explains the true history of the Rock, the aboriginal view of what Uluru means and the chance to listen to its true owners was everything we thought it would be and more. The walks are awesome, full walk around the Uluru is about 10km, takes about 2 to 2 and a half hours but do it early or it is too hot through the day. There are shorter walks. Don't even think about climbing the Rock, it is something the Anangu people do not do, do not want other people to do and strongly discourage people from doing! We respected their views and would not climb Uluru. The cultural centre is a must visit and the $25 entry to the national park was worth every cent! A great Australian experience!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We have been before but brought family here and to see the light show. No one should come to Australia and not see this rock! (Although everyone should be aware of how far away from civilisation it actually is, not a two minute trip from accomodation!) Each time we go we notice something new. We have never climbed the rock as it is not encouraged, however everyone does and maybe next time we will!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Seeing Uluru is an amazing experience, we did our tour with AAT Kings one of the main operators in the Red Centre. We did the Base and Sunset tour which took us firstly on a base walk around one of the waterholes, the guide explained three of the Stories surrounding Uluru and why it is so important to the local people. The Guide also explained why they recommend not climbing the rock and this is for several reasons. The first is that 40 plus people have died climbing it. Then also Uluru is made of Sandstone with oxidized Iron Surrounding the Sand Stone, this is what gives Uluru its red colour but it is also preventing it from being eroded. You can see on the climb trail a line where from people climbing it is wearing off the Iron Protective layer. Also people who do climb tend to need to relieve themselves during the climb, this is causing a high level of E-Coli in the waterholes at the bottom of Uluru, this means the local animals can no longer drink from the waterholes. The Final Reason is the sacred nature of Uluru, and well you wouldn't want someone to climb your church. The Sunset viewing area is lovely and wine and nibbles were provided as part of the tour. Watching the sunset and seeing Uluru Change colour in such a relaxed setting was very special."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru in November and stayed for 4 nights. On our first morning there, we did the sunrise and then walked around the base of Uluru. It is an easy walk, being completely flat. And very good to do as you can see all aspects and sides of the the rock. It is just over 10 kilometres to walk it and it took us nearly three hours, allowing for camera and rest stops along the way. Tip.....do it early in the day before the heat of the midday sun sets in."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well, why wouldn't you. You must And yes sunrise and sunset are best as the colour does change significantly over 15 min or so. Would recommend a guided tour, if not the whole of the way around then at least the shorter free tour given by the rangers at 8am"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"How can Uluru get anything other than 5 stars? It is an amazing natural wonder in a harshly beautiful land. As the bloke serving at the petrol station said... ""of corse its hot, it's the bloody red centre, the desert mate"". If you're there in summer like me we just planned well and went out sight- seeing during the early morning and later in the afternoon. We had a bit of a rest or a swim during the hot hours of the day. We didn't do a tour but hired a car and went around ourselves which was fine (I can't compare it to a tour as we didn't do one). This gave us freedom to do as we wish. My bit of advice would be to bring your own food if you are staying in a place with cooking facilities. There is a supermarket but it's expensive (as expected as it's remote). We flew into Alice and drove to Uluru so picked up some supplies like cereal and road trip snacks there. Happy we did :). The drive from Alice to Uluru was great actually. Interesting to see the country change and we saw a goanna, a lizard and Brumbys (wild horses). We stopped at the road houses too which was great. So the trip was part of the experience. Took about 5 hours with stopping for a meal and other stop for fuel. So pretty quick really. BEWARE though if you're hiring a car it might be limited km so they only allow 100km a day and the 25c each kilometre after that. So budget car rental is hitting me for an extra $170 for my 5 day car hire. It's called a remote charge which I think is total crap as I think it being remote indicates that unlimited km are even more necessary as people will be likely to be driving further. So just keep that in mind when planning your trip. But otherwise. Absolutely 5 stars for Uluru ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We had an amazing weekend here at the start of November. Sunset is definitely the time to visit with Uluru taking on amazing colour in the final moments of the sun going down. Even without climbing if there is plenty to see with walks showing caves with drawings etc. Definitely worth having a guide to fill you in or the meaning of the place will not be understood
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is an amazing natural wonder. The rock is impressive in photos but when you see it up close it is truly incredible. The erosion on the sides of the rock face has created some incredible designs. There is a section you can climb but it is closed it if it too hot outside. You can drive or hike around Uluru at the base the rock. I drove from Alice Springs on a day trip...five hours each way. Suggest you fly from Alice Springs (yes, there is a local airport) or stay overnight at the resorts, located just outside of the national park."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Had a fantastic day at Uluru. Such a stunning piece of nature to visit. Heard so many stories that it is just a rock but with the sunsets and sunrises it is so much more. Has to be seen to be believed
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Forget the fact that there will be hundreds of tourists there. Forget the flies. This is a place you have just got to visit. See it at sunrise, see it a sunset, walk around it during the day. Go to the cultural centre to learn more of its meaning to the indigenous people. An unmissable, and mystical experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Spent 2 full days at Ayers Rock area and love the experience. One of the most remote places I've been we enjoyed the resort area and both rock formations. Did a sunrise and sunset as well as the Sounds of Silence and Field of Light experiences. Definitely not an inexpensive experience but a once in a lifetime thing to do
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru and the red centre is 1 of the last places that I had to visit in Oz to have seen the whole of my homeland - the past 3 days I have been in awe of the peaceful solitude and beauty of this place, and asking myself why? Why did it take half a century to visit? Sunrise visit is a must do - absolutely spectacular and we had amazing weather! Sunset is different and also very good - especially with champagne, canapes and a super moon to boot. Should you climb? I have mixed emotions on this vexing question. I will leave the decision to each individual, but aside from cultural and environmental considerations I can say that it looks quite dangerous. Uluru truly deserves its UNESCO world heritage double listing and is a spectacular natural wonder worthy of a visit by everyone. I felt privileged to make it here, even if it took 50 years. Must do 'bucket list' - tick , but I would love to return to this magical place to again experience it's serene power!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Be sure to do this trip, an amazing sight, go early morning as it's 14km around and don't forget total plenty of water as the taps around the sight don't tend to work"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"All the National park is an unique experience for travelers willing to have different tastes in life. Uluru is beautiful, magestic and the sunset is such awesome. The weather was nice, not too hot."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Put this on your bucket list as it truly is an incredible site. But please do not climb the Rock, there are plenty of either self-guided or escorted walks around the base to enjoy."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,My friend and I visited Uluru in September and I can honestly say it was the most amazing experience. I will be returning very soon with my family
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The sight of Uluru at sunset and sunrise is magical. The base walk is an experience not to be missed as you get so close to the rock.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We were at Uluru in 2006 during our first visit to Australia and it was quite interesting in our younger years fogged by alcohol and various pharmaceutical grade intoxicants. At the time we did a tour with a guy who was entertaining but was certain that the rock was put there by aliens. This time around, being a bit more mature, especially now that my wife is along for the ride for the next few weeks and being a little less fogged than a decade ago we enjoyed the experience in a different way. The rock is another one of Australias notable icons that people can instantly recognize like the Opera House, it’s a big red rock in the middle of a desert so people know it. We did a morning tour of Uluru, up super early to watch the sun rise at Uluru and then hiked up as it climbing was allowed when we were there. We had hear reports about it being closed randomly, if you want it closed, close it completely or leave it open to be climbed. The reasoning is wacky and no discernible reasons really, but we climbed it and it took us a bit longer than it did ten years ago. Still a lovely walk and climb and the scenery is marvelous."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After seeing Uluru four times, with the sun shining, and the cloud, never did I see it the bright orange colour that we're led to believe it is."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This ancient monolith is impressive and humbling. In my opinion, this is the spiritual heart of Australia and has to be seen to be believed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A wonderful rock protected by the aborgin's customs and beliefs. The red stone stands in the desert like a giant ship in the middle of an ocean.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The base walk at Uluru is stunning. Pack lots of water and snacks (and be sure to have a toilet break before you head off - there's no toilets on the base walk!). Be sure to leave early and finish before 11am to avoid the blasting desert heat and give yourself time to do the little offshoot walks to the waterhole and the gorge. The many stories from the traditional custodian's, the Anangu people, dotted along the way emphasise how sacred, ancient and important this place is. I've done this walk in February and late October - both were very hot and it's essential to start early and finish early (it takes between 3 and 4 hours, depending on your speed - but don't expect to walk fast - the heat and the photo opportunities make sure you take it slow). Absolutely worth the heat and the time. If you're not into walking the whole way round, there are smaller more manageable walks as well. In the evening, make sure you visit one of the sunset viewing spots to take in the changing, wondrous colours as the sun goes down. Love this place!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,While the rock is beautiful at sunrise and sunset it is magnificent when seen up close. It has so many variations and details that are missed from a distance. A walk all the way around is the best way to really experience the beauty. We walked counter clockwise starting at the kutiya car park shortly after dawn and found that gave us the most shade which is important on hot days.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's a mesmerizing place to visit. Had been long on my bucket list! We saw the rock from a distance at sunset time and it was gorgeous! Also did the base walk , started very early in morning. It's about 10 km but is flat and easy! Morning sun rays falling on the monolith creates an unforgettable memory! Every side of it has a story behind it, Different fomrations on the rock, all very fascinating! It's one of those places that talk to you, When you do the base walk, you realise the massiveness of the monolith and the fact that a huge portion is buried under the earth is astonishing! Don't expect views like Kings Canyon but there's something about it that attracts you! 'The Rock' as it is called! A must must visit!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Obviously everyone goes to Uluru to see ""The Rock"". You don't appreciate it until you see it firstly as it comes into view when you either fly or drive in and then when you go out to it or watch the sunset over it. It should be a pilgrimage for every Australian. I strongly suggest that you walk around the base (over 10 km) or do as my family did and that's hire the bikes to ride around. It is a very level and easy ride but make sure you take plenty of water and enjoy as you take in the enormity of this magnificent Australian icon. Be aware that it is a 2 km ride from where you hire the bikes so you need to be ready for an approx. 15km total trip."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It was winter and I took a camping tour. We slept outside in a sleeping bag and my sleeping bag was not for minus temperature so it was deadly cold but it was good experience. There were no flies because it was cold. That was a good point. We could climb the big rock. It was lucky because I heard it is not always allowed to climb.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Did a sunrise & sunset tour & walk of this Amazing Rock. It's bigger than I thought it would be but even bigger when up close to it. The different colours it changes to are spectacular also.It was closed the day we where for climbing but didn't bother us, to climb it looks like it would be difficult. Everyone should have respect for the sacred place that it is. We did a helicopter flight over as well & that gave it even more spectacular views."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Ayres Rock (Uluru) in November and it was simply jaw droppingly beautiful. We were incredibly lucky that the weather was cool for the time of year and we even had a little rain. We arrived at Uluru to watch the sunset from the sunset viewing area and it was an amazing site to behold. We then stayed locally and got up at 04:30 to watch the sun rise and again, it was a real treat. For the sunrise there were four or five coaches plus people, like us, who had got themselves there and so the viewing platforms were quite busy even by 05:30 (sunrise was 05:57). I would recommend getting there early and finding your spot - some of the paths around have really good views too. Even my two boys (10 and 8 at time of visit) thought it was amazing to watch the rock light up at sunrise and did not mind the early start."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We drove from Alice Springs. The drive itself was an adventure. Two evenings having a picnic supper by the rock gave a fantastic light show. Take a Ranger. Guided walk/talk. They are free and much better than the organised package deal visits!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The walk around the rock is long but flat so not difficult at all. Better to begin early because of the sun... Take a bottle to drink and refill the water on the way...
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is really a special place! Watching the sunset and the changing light over the Rock is a fantastic experience only to be topped by getting up early to watch the sunrise.the colours are amazing and is afantastic place to visit.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This may be ""just a rock"", but it's varying textures, topography, and environs make it feel like a mountain range. Not to be missed."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Absolutely, go to the Red Center. We go in their winter when it can be a bit cold, but lacks the flies the outback is famous for. Over the past 25 years I've been there a number of times and it is always spectacular. The first time there was the first climb, back when it was typical to climb at least part way up, when the aboriginals referred to us as ants as we made our little trail up the worn hiking path. Over the years they have at first banned the climb and then relented and now only ask that you respect their wishes and not climb it. While climbing is spectacular, if increasingly dangerous as we age, there are other ways to enjoy the monolith. On one trip we took a plane tour, taking off in a reasonably sized Cessna about 30 minutes before sunset for a tour of Kings Canyon and the two outcrops for which the area is famous. Another visit saw us in a tour circumnavigating the base with small hikes into crevices and along the bottom. All expeditions have been very worthwhile. Tips: apart from the two outcrops, there is not a lot to see and do. While there are decent places to stay for all budgets, plan to be there two days, maybe three, depending on how outdoor worthy you are and the weather conditions at the time of year of your trip. And a quick technical note... this is NOT a ""large rock"" sitting out in the Outback. This is an outcrop, a weathered remnant of a continuous deposition across a much broader area. The formation is continuous across to the Olgas."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Having always wanted to see for myself the majestic national park with both Uluru and the olgas , I don't think you can describe in words the majestic magic of this incredible place . Even on a cloudy day it's truly moving, the colours , the magnitude of the age , history and geography is life changing. Loved this placed and felt so moved to experience by car , on foot and then in the sky by helicopter. It's a must do on the bucket list."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"As I read about this place and what it is, I wondered why it was included in the tour. I was very wrong. It is a magnificent sight as I came up to it. I saw it gleam in the setting sun and radiant in the morning sun. See it if possible!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visiting Uluru has been on my bucket list for many years. I finally visited and I have to say it was well worth the wait. The culture, the colours the national park. It was all so amazing and beautiful. I loved visiting Uluru. I completed the base walk which was just over 10km. I'd highly recommend leaving early in the morning to do this as it gets extremely warm."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru, also called Ayers Rock, is a name given to a huge rock near Alice Springs in the Australian Outback and located in Uluru-Kata Tjuṯa National Park. It lies 355 KM south west of the near large town, Alice Springs. Uluru is sacred and a holy place for the Indigenous people of Australia. It was Such a spiritual experience. Loved the cave paintings and luckily when I was there had been some rain so lots of green scenery. So much to do and so much to see. You can go for a Camel ride just like the early pioneers did and go and embark on an unforgettable journey through red dune country with Uluru in the background, you can have visit one of Australia’s most spectacular open-air restaurants set under the brilliant skies with magnificent a magnificent view of Uluru and you can also pay a visit to the Cultural Centre in the National Park for an introduction to the local Indigenous culture and traditions. By the way the stars in the night from Uluru/Yulara are amazing"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I did not think that Uluru was as red as what it shows in most photos. What an amazing place to visit. It has been on my husbands bucket list and it can now be ticked of as one of the amazing places to visit
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This amazing site-the largest single rock in the world-is a double UNESCO site. One for natural and the other for the aborigine culture. The journey by either air or over the Lasseter and Stuart highways through the undeveloped dry land of the Australian Bush is an experience in itself. While hiking to the top is discouraged or even forbidden for safety and cultural reasons, the six mile hike around the base proved rewarding. Make the effort to see the other Australia outside the great Metro area."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was my 3rd trip - on this occasion to see the Field of Light, and to show it to my child. You can get a great view if you are on the left side of the plane coming from the south. In the resort it can be seen easily from many spots. We had a car - I would recommend this, then you aren't tied into bus schedules. The tours/bus transfers aren't cheap, and I think the car works much better. Weather permitting (i.e. not too hot) I would recommend do the 8am ranger walk, followed by a coffee/snack at the cultural centre, then get the 10-10.30 bike slot and ride around the whole rock. I've walked it in the past, bike was much more fun. On this occasion it was blisteringly hot, so we did the 7.30 bike circuit only. If you have a car, you can then go to the Kata Tjuta lookout as well before heading back."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There aren't enough words to describe how amazing Uluru is. I went as part of an organised sunrise tour and it was amazing to hear all the Aboriginal stories behind the rock formations and ""pictures"" on the rock face. We saw lots of people walking around Uluru on their own and we let quite sorry for them and the incredible stories they missed out on. My only advice is to make sure you take a face net. The flies are savage as soon as the sun comes up and I cannot thank the person who gave us that tip enough. We bought ours, relatively cheaply, from the shop at the Ayres Rock Resort and it was an absolute God send which we have loaned to so many people!!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We came with not many expectations and were really pleasant surprised. It is a very interesting cultural experience. We walked around the rock, but saw others climbing it (not for the feint hearted or culturally sensitive). The rock at sunset was awesome..."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We drove a long way to get here, and we weren't dissappointed. Take the time to see this part of Australia, it's well worth it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We walked the circuit and were surprised by the variety to the Rock and surface together with all the caves, water and vegetation and ensuing local history. The interpretation boards were good with cultural detail - further information regarding the plants and geology would have been helpful. Paths good and easy to follow. At times tour groups were noisy."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Stayed three nights in the caravan park it was 3 nights for the price of 2, We just loved what Uluru had to offer. If you are planning to climb the rock my advice would be plan to arrive at the base of the rock at 7:30 each morning until the condition are favourable they tend to close the walk/climb for any reason and above all be respectful of the beautiful and magnificent Uluru. If the walk is closed don't walk up you may be hit with a large fine and you will upset the Rangers. We stayed at the sunset viewing area for hours just looking at the amazing big sky At the moment the outback is so green due to all the ran so get out there"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We decided to walk around the base of this magnificent wonder. Respectfully of the local people's beliefs, we found the walk to be too long and not close enough to the actual base. Having said that, just to be able to walk around this wonder, is just incredible."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,does this place affect you. Actually v green and lots of flowers when we visited. Even a little waterfall. so unusual the locals were taking photos. Very impressive both at sunset and sunrise
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Such a spiritual experience. Loved the cave paintings and luckily when I was there there had been some rain so lots of green scenery.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Legendary. Picturesque. You actually don't appreciate the size of the monolith until you actually enter the national park and drive towards it. Really nice. Must do bucket list. Btw the stars in the night from Uluru/Yulara are amazing...
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You gotta see it. Yes it is just a big rock, but stunningly beautiful. The morning light is the best. Please don't climb it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is difficult to find anything new to say about this massive rock which has iconic sunsets and sunrises and is a must see. Yes there are loads of people but that does not detract from watching the rock change wonderful colours at sunset and sunrise with a glass of wine or hot chocolate in your hand. The AAT Kings guides were very good, knowledgeable and helpful. Be aware that it is very cold watching the sunrise, you will need all the layers you have brought."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did the SEIT sunrise base tour of Uluru and it was the highlight of our trip to Central Australia. Our guide Nadia picked us up from the hotel at 5am and we set off in the dark. We were given breakfast packs to carry ourselves, although we decided to take only the bare essentials to save the weight. When we started it was cold and dark and there was a full moon which was very atmospheric. The sun was just starting to rise and we walked on the soft sand hearing many interesting facts from Nadia who knew so much about the plants, wildlife and culture of the area. We stopped often to hear stories about the Aboriginal dream time and see the wonderful rock paintings, caves and waterholes. Half way round we stopped for breakfast near where people climb the rock. There are clean toilets there and seats under shade. The second half was harder going because of the heat but there were plenty of stops to look at more fascinating things. Nadia paced the tour well and was conscious of other groups on the track, holding us back sometimes so we could experience a particular area without other people there. There were only 5 people in our tour which made it very personal. It was quite tiring, at nearly 4 hours of walking, even though the track itself is flat and easy. Make sure you've got good walking shoes and lots of layers to take off as the day heats up. We went through 1 litre of water each which was less than we'd planned for but most of that was drunk in the second half of the tour when the sun was up. If you were going in the afternoon you'd need plenty more. We're glad we did the sunrise tour rather than an afternoon tour as the first two hours in the early morning were magical."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru (Ayers Rock) one of the worlds wonders! If you drive to Yulara you will see the Rock the first time about 35km from Yulara, looking 11o'clock. Always a great moment for us. Visit the Cultural Centre first, to get information, look at the Galleries or have a cup of coffee. A great facility we generally visit 2-3 times. Uluru is a walking paradise, with many short walks on well made paths, or the full circuit 10.6km. Many walks are partly shaded and are easy access for wheel chairs. hence it is great for anyone. No excuses. But do not forget to bring your fly spray or head netting, lots of flies!! The area offers plenty of benches to sit and view the marvellous rock shapes and surrounding vegetation. Sunset viewing is very popular, so get in position early! The colour of Uluru will change every minute, hence have your camera set up, because light conditions and colour changes will catch you out! We will visit again next year. Cant get enough!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Amazing experience and beautiful place. We enjoyed it visiting so much. It's just a bit of a shame that the way Uluru and Kata Tjuta are used by the locals isn't explained as they keep the use secret (understandably!)
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Simply extraordinary! The wonder, colours, wildflowers, and ancient spirituality of this magnificent place just blew me away."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This monolith really stuns because of size, color and the fact it is just there in the middle of nowhere. No wonder the native people were awed, I certainly was."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This has been on my bucket list forever!! Was not disappointed! This is one of the most beautiful, spiritual and awesome places I have EVER been! Go! Don't hesitate...just go! I'd recommend hiring a car, but there are plenty of tours you can go on. Best. Holiday. Ever! Oh...this place is remote....really remote! And red, really red!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What a fabulous time to visit Uluru with spring wildflowers everywhere, desert birds plentiful and of course Uluru at its spectacular best. Once upon time would have wanted to do the climb but with the sensitiveness now of this we were really satisfied with walking around Uluru. The base walk is spectacular and really easy to do."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When I arrived the sunrise car park, it was 9am. there isn't a car there at all. But the view from the viewing deck still amazing! If you can get up early, go and see sunrise, if not, a later time ok to see the beautiful view too."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Had a wonderful picnic lunch at the base of Uluru. Must see location for views and walks. Sunrise and sunset amazing.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Magic and breathtaking, sunrise and sunset viewing a must see excursion. Entry into park $25 for a 3 day pass"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I did a sunrise tour that started with this amazing red monolith rock in the middle of nowhere. As the sun began to rise it changed from brown to bright red. That was simply unbelievable. As you drive in the national park, the shape changes quite alot. I know it is just a big red rock, but I am very blessed to have seen it in so many colors."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru sunrise on tour with aat was brilliant. Before you go you may worry the place will be crowded with tourists but the area is so large it just absorbs the numbers. Sunrise is a beautiful experience so peaceful and quiet. Sunset is also interesting but for me sunrise was more striking. Really Worth all the travel to get there. A return visit could certainly be done using a hire car from Ayers Rock airport. This way you would have more time at the various points and could pace yourself. Definitely worth flying to Ayers Rock airport and missing the 5hour drive from Alice springs.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Definitely a perfect time of year to visit as the wild flowers were beautiful! I think we caught a window after rains that allowed the blooms to come out! Base walk was good, but for some reason seemed much further than 10.6KM. There are areas that you are not allowed to take photos, which we didn't to 'respect' the spiritual reference of the spots."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Beautiful. Stunning sunset over Uluru. Best to go earlish morning. Wonderful experience. Well signposted with historical and cultural information. Plenty of seating to sit and look at the stunning landscape.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We decided to beat the heat and walk around this amazing famous land-mark as early as possible. We were first ones at the park gate opening time of 5am. We started our walk in pitch black around 5.45am using torches to guide our way. Uluru is huge and a little ""eerie"", especially before the sun is fully out. Its around a 10k flat walk around the base. It is rather interesting with different textures. As the sunrises we see different colours and shadows. There are old aboriginal caves situated here and there at the base of the rock and because we walked this in spring plenty of desert plant life all around. There are signs posted with information of each site along the way. A good 2-3 hours walk. Enjoyable walk without it being too hard. Take plenty of water. Just best to beat the heat of midday. Lots of flies in October and no doubt as the season warms up even more so wear your fly net hat! Can be purchased anywhere in NT."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I visited Uluru as part of a tour, and found it to be fascinating You are able to walk up to it and round the base. It varies in features depending on the part you look at. I also witnessed sunset on the rock, and it was interesting to see it change shade. Well worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went around the park and saw a lot, did the base walk around both sites as well as the cultural centre. We planned to climb having observed the arguments for both sides as this is a controversial decision. I think we felt that it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity and as long as we were respectful (didn't litter or eat on the rock) felt morally sound to do it. However, all days the climb was closed due to high winds which was a shame - the climb is very vulnerable to being closed so I would recommend to not plan to only do the climb as you will most likely be disappointed. There is plenty else to do whilst you're there! Hopefully one day we will be able to climb, but I fear it will be closed soon enough."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I had two weeks travelling in Australia - I had to start in Brisbane and finish in Sydney, and with my extra four days, I booked a flight from Sydney to Ayers Rock airport (AUD450 return with Jetstar if you book early enough). Is it worth flying to a desert the middle of nowhere to see a bunch of rocks? Yes - the scenery is otherworldly and there's a surprising amount to do. And although it's hard to do Uluru cheap, it is possible to do it cheaper. The Ayers Rock resort is small with about four hotels, one supermarket, a few eateries, and a free bus that cycles the resort every 15 minutes. I stayed at the Outback Pioneer Lodge and cooked for myself when possible. Buses to and from the resort are synchronised with the few flights. Buy a face net from the supermarket to protect from bush flies (they don't bite, they're just very annoying). And bring warm clothes for morning activities - it's colder than you might think! Activities can be booked through multiple agencies but all run by the same operators. Plan carefully and nap if you can - you'll be waking up very early a lot! Here are reviews of the activities I did:- AAT Kings - Sunrise tour and Kata Tjuta Walpa Gorge - Sunrise was good but if you are pressed for time, prioritise the sunset tour over it (or go with Uluru Express as mentioned later). Walpa Gorge was very pretty but knowing what I know now I would have probably have done Valley of the Winds. AAT Kings - Sunset tour, base highlights and cultural centre - You're given a guided tour of some of the highlights of Uluru's base, including a cave with Aboriginal paintings, a water hole and several sites of cultural importance. The cultural centre was rather short but I bought a painted boomerang! And sunset was great - a snack buffet, a chance to meet the Anangu people and yes, the rock does seem to glow red! AAT Kings - King's Canyon tour - A long journey but worth it (and probably the better way to do it - the King's Canyon resort centre is even more remote and tiny than the Ayers rock resort). The canyon gives a lot of dramatic views, varied scenery and amazing photo opportunities. We also stopped at a cafe/farm for breakfast and a bar on the way home. Uluru Express - sunrise and base walk/climb - Not a tour, just transportation. But if you're set on doing the sunrise tour, then this may be a better way to do it. The main reason I did this was because I wanted to get to Uluru early to do either the self-guided base walk or climb before flying out. I didn't do the base walk, but it was a backup plan if the climb was not open. It takes about 3-4 hours to walk the base of Uluru. The climb is a controversial option. It is only open if the weather is good (and it was closed for at least two of my days there). The initial climb is short but VERY steep (there is a chain in the rock) and people have died here from heart attacks. Also, the Anangu consider Uluru to be sacred and ask that tourists do not climb it - there have been plans to close it for many years. I was torn as to whether to do it, but I decided not to miss the opportunity and climbed - the views from the top are utterly incredible - I may never see so much blue sky again in my life. But decide for yourself whether you think it's right to do so. Overall I'm very glad I went to Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. It's heavy on the wallet but equally so on the experiences and memories."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Since there isn't a listing for Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, I'm putting all my information here instead of splitting it up into each part of the park. This is a must-see on a trip to Australia! We were fortunate that during our visit, the wildflowers were in bloom, and everyone said that it was the most impressive display of flowers in over 10 years due to some extra rain this year. We went the easy route, and flew into Ayers Rock airport, were picked up by the resort shuttle, and then went with a tour company for the evening tour, sunset viewing and BBQ dinner under the stars, followed by a sunrise viewing and morning hike. The park has a great cultural center that helps visitors learn about the native people who were just given back control of their land and are kindly still allowing all of us to visit! If anyone reads the displays, listens to the stories, and still think it would be a good idea to climb Uluru, I'd be floored. It makes it clear that the requests not to climb or photograph certain areas are really just about respecting another culture's sacred spaces. Uluru is truly a sight to behold in daylight as well as sunset and sunrise. Kata Tjuta is equally impressive; our morning hike on day 2 was in that area. We had some amazing views and truly enjoyed the wildflowers. The flies were not bad yet in late September when we visited; this may be a good time of year to visit!! Not many flies, and lots of flowers!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Intrepid / Adventure tours, and in particular, our guide - the knowledgeable, entertaining, enthusiastic, well organized, hard working and always good humoured, Joe - helped make this bucket list item memorable and magical. Yes, it's a long way from anywhere, but that's part of the desert experience. Pick up the tour in Alice Springs to get a true feel for the real Australian outback on the journey to Kata Tjuta - valley of the winds; sunset champagne and sunrise Base walk around Uluru should not be missed; and the Kings Canyon Rim walk, while maybe a bit challenging for those afraid of heights like myself, but definitely doable if you're physically up to climbing 450 steep bush steps plus some clambering up and down rocks - an awesome walk! Go for the ""glamping"" option to enjoy a comfortable night in a bed with linens, it's not much more cost wise but worth it - you'll also have electricity to recharge cameras etc. Don't expect 5 star cuisine but the camp hosts do a good job of providing plenty of food,including vegetarian option (if you let them know when you book). Will definitely recommend this trip to all our friends, Aussie and others and look forward to arranging our next adventure through Intrepid / Adventure tours. Thanks, Joe!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Choosing to explore the walk around the base of Uluru was a tiring but rewarding experience. The information plaques were fascinating and the billabongs magical. We really enjoyed the variety of birdlife and wildflowers. The shaded water refill station half way was very welcome!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I enjoy taking photos, and I am sure that I took well into the 100's of photos, starting with sunrise, all through the day, sunset and even into the evening with the starts above it. I walked to Mutitjulu waterhole and also did the Mala walk. I visited the Cultural Centre. Amazing!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Went to the rock recently with a friend and was soooooo surprised at how much this place effected me. The sheer size of this rock was amazing. something about it i cant put my finger on. Make sure you do the sunrise and sunset look as the rock looks different at all times of the day.I climbed it and still had the same respect for the local indigenous people but they recommend not to. I think its just a OHS ploy not to get you to climb a dangerous rock. If you do wear good footwear it can get slippery and you don't have any second chances if you slip. If you like a quiet beer each night take plenty before you get there as take ways cost me $41 for 1 six pack. ILL BE BACK WAS AMAZING PLACE
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I was more excited to visit the Field of Lights than to see the rock to be honest but when you actually see it for the first time on the horizon and even more so when you get up close to it I have to admit there's something quite magical about it. Check out the Cultural Centre before you go to the base walk area so that you have an understanding of what you're looking at.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visited twice, once for dawn and once for sunset. Spent much of the morning walking around Uluru - it's huge! And lovely!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had a fantastic visit to Yulara and Kings Canyon. It is very touristy, understandably. If you can deal with that, it is well worth the trip. However, we had some trouble with food and eczema issues that we were not prepared for. Firstly, finding gluten free and lactose free food at cheaper cafes AND /OR supermarket was very difficult. Secondly, there is NO CHEMIST for hundreds of kms and the medical centre is open very limited hours. I recommend coming prepared!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is definitely one place on earth worth visiting... Just don't expect to climb the rock, expect to be harassed if you try, and try and ignore the attempt of 'them' trying to make you feel guilty because you're visiting an Aboriginal land"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The spiritual heart of Australia. Amazing sunrise views and the local stories give us a glimpse into indigenous culture.We did the sunrise base walk and it was well worth it.This year we were lucky to see a lot of flora due to the excess rains.Needless to say an absolute must see and experience in the NT, best times to travel are upto September as it can get quite warm after that."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Fantastic sight to behold especially up close A wonderful walk better to go early morning in late spring or summer
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,After many hours of driving on a terrific highway designed to help drivers stay awake and focused. Apparently the curves in the road were engineered into the design to keep drivers interested. The land is basically flat and the road could be as straight as an arrow. The surface is good on the two lane highway and passing other travelers is not too stressful. My Conner is the first big red lump encountered. A few hundred kilometers later Uluru rises out of the desert on the horizon. Wow! Spectacular.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We got to walk around the wonderful sight all day and stay for a sunset. The colors and setting is just beautiful. It's amazing to see if change colors right before your eyes. You must experience this amazing place.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is a must-do tour if you want to experience the essence of the outback with limited time (2 nights). It covers the 3 main unmissable locations - Kings Canyon, Kata Tjuta and Uluru. Unlike most other tours, it starts with a 3.5 hour sunrise walk in Kings Canyon - this is great because you get the hardest (but spectacular) walk out of the way then work your way back to Uluru as your tour's breathtaking finale. Our tour guide Justin is one of the most dedicated, knowledgeable and energetic guides we've had the pleasure of sharing the past 3 days with. He went out of his way to look after us while keeping us entertained and well-fed all the way, despite sleep depreciation and a stomach upset. I highly recommend this tour and thanks again for the memories Justin ""Pinkie""!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To be honest, visiting Uluru wasn't high on my bucket list, but the opportunity arose and I took it. I wasn't expecting an earth shattering experience from a rock in the middle of nowhere, but my god I was impressed. The sunrise 10km walk after the recent rains, with the blooming desert flowers was so beautiful I recommend everyone go, don't wait until you've ticked off everything else on your overseas bucket list like I was going to do :)"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing to finally see Uluru!!! Every Australian should visit here at least once in their life. Plenty of overseas travellers!!!Truly a beautiful sight to view! We made sure we saw her when the sun rose over her and the sun set on her. We couldn't stop photographing her. Walking the total perimeter with a guide was very interesting, hearing aboriginal stories of past and present. September was a great month to visit, weather was perfect, the mornings very cold but the weather warmed up to mid to high twenties. Just a few random flies, we were differently happy about that! So much aboriginal culture and history! The wild flowers were amazing!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The most amazing sunrises and sunsets, it's a place to go and unwind... stunning rock. You feel sense of calmness when you visit Uluru and it's must do at least once in your lifetime."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"No matter if you visit it at sunrise, sunset or at anytime during the day, this place is an absolute must see. An early wake up is extremely worth it if you want to see it appearing from the darkness. Complete your visit with some of the rewarding walks available, in our case we took the Mala walk which runs along the base of the rock and where you can see some of the story of ""mala"" people and its traditions, highly recommended. As a general advice, be aware of the heat and local wildlife, but with common sense this visit will be unforgettable and one the highlights of your trip."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Seeing Uluru was so amazing, we saw it at sunrise, sunset, with mist over it, and during the day...not one of these sights failed to mesmerise me. We walked around it and it is so spiritual and it gives you a feeling of awe. The shape, size, carvings, crevices and folds in this magnificent rock totally gobsmacked me. Hearing an aboriginal talking about growing up in this region, and telling us about aboriginal life, was very interesting. We walked around it & it took us about two and a half hours..very surreal. We were also lucky that there had been rain, so the wild flowers and shrubs were in bloom and so pretty. For overseas visitors, and also Aussies this is a must to see."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you are looking for an adventurous journey, the Australian Outback is the best place to go. Just be aware that some of the most dangerous animals world wide live in Australia, so keep your eyes open for snakes and spiders. It`s best if you travel in a small group and get a tour guide. Make sure to sleep under the stars for at least one night . Seeing the milky way and the night sky is a truly inspiring and mind-blowing experience. Always stay open-minded, especially with the food. It may seem pretty weird to eat a camel burger or kangaroo bologna. But once you`ve tried it, it`s not too bad at all.The scenery is eye-popping. Everyone knows about the Uluru, but the cultural aspect is not appreciated enough. When you are there, definitely ask your tour guide about the history and the sacred meaning of the place. The most important thing is to enjoy yourself at all times!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We stayed nearby and camped. We did the walk around the base of Uluru. Honestly it's a decent hike around the base and if you aren't fit I would not bother doing the back of the rock at all. You can not take pictures around the back of the rock at all and the walk is quite a long way from the rock in any case. The front / car park side is really good with great signage and park ranger info walks daily. Some limited restrictions to photographs but not so bad. Climbing the rock is not encouraged and often not allowed due to a number of factors. We did not climb the rock out of respect to the original custodians.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This should be 1 of those bucket list items. It is iconic, it is magnificent and a true wonder. A great big rock in the middle of nowhere. Lots of things to see and do around the area and tour companies provide some really great stories of the ""legends"" surrounding the area. NOW, if wanting to climb - you will not be allowed to climb if you go with any of the tour companies as it is totally frowned upon as The Indigenous do not want you to climb BUT, if you attend there as Joe Blow public under your own steam, you can climb it providing the access points have not been blocked. This can happen mainly due to weather events such as heat, rain, wind....."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did the base walk late morning to mid afternoon. We were 4 adults and 5 kids (7-16) and we all enjoyed this. The rock climb was closed due to safety reasons but it looked grueling. The actual base walk is gorgeous. I would recommend packing water, lunch and definitely wear a hat. The sun and heat were a bit tough in some areas and I regret not having a hat! The landscape is just beyond words and the rock itself continues to change while you walk. I also viewed Uluru during Sunrise and Sunset. If you can only mange one do the Sunset - it's absolutely magic!!!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The Rock was breathtaking! I went there not expecting much just a place to go before I left aus but I was really taken aback by how massive the rock was. The national park was beautiful such an amazing thing to do but hire a car if you can, the bus to the national park from the resort is extortionately priced, driving around yourself is much better. I would recommend anyone to add it to their bucket list! Unfortunately let down by the resort which you can't escape because there is nowhere else to stay, staff were rude, rooms were like prison cells and it was more than expensive! But what can you do?! If I wasn't for the rock being amazing I would of been really annoyed that I wasted my money there!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Going there is a one in a life time experience. The place has a big importance in the aboriginal culture, and you should do the walk with the ranger (every morning at 10am and it is free) to understand it better. Come for the sunset and sunrise to see the changing color on the Uluru is an amazing spectacle!! I also recommend to do the Kata Tjuta valley of the wind walk. It is less known but as impressive as the Uluru. It was really amazing to be there!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This tour far exceeded our expectations. It is a 12.5km walk at a good pace in our group of capable walkers but our guide, Tyson, was just brilliant. He was knowledgable and entertaining and he was kind and courteous. We had a much better experience doing a guided tour than we would have if we has just walked around Uluru by ourselves. We learnt about the Anangu people's connection to Uluru and the lore stories of the landscape. We also learnt about the flora and fauna. We were very lucky to be there in spring after good rainfall to see lots of wildflowers and birds. It was a wonderful and memorable tour very professionally put together by AAT Kings and we highly recommend it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We stayed at Emu Walk Apartments and made the short car trip to Uluru. Unfortunately we weren't able to hire the bikes we wanted but instead did a few short walks around the base. We didn't take any of the guided tours, but the signage is quite good so felt that we could read enough about the experience. We travelled with a 14 and 11 year old, the walk not physically challenging, but beware of the heat and take plenty of water and sunscreen. Sandwiches and snacks available, would recommend going to the IGA at the Resort to take your own. The flies weren't too bad in Sept/Oct but have heard that earlier in the year they are unbearable. Amazing sights, hard to believe how large the rock is until you're up close."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is a very important monument that should be respected by all. Sadly management has chosen money over respecting the monument by placing stabilizing posts for climbers to hold on to while climbing a sacred place that should never be disrespected in such a manner. There are many locations around the base that ask visitors not to photograph but scaring the beautiful monument is OK. Go figure.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I truly wasn't prepared for the size and magnificence of this wonderful piece provided by Mother Nature. We were lucky enough to see rain on the rock and will definitely be back to try and capture that lovely sunset shot.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We were lucky enough to visit in what was told to us was the ""best wildflower event in living memory"", so that was a great bonus on a fantastic place to visit. We did both the sunset/sunrise events, which were spectacular, but go early to get a good position. The 3 day park pass purchased on your initial entry, will ensure you get to do everything you need to do while you are there. After sunrise, we respected the wishes of the indigenous people and did not climb the rock, but elected to hire bikes (must book - Outback Bikes) for an easy 15klm ride around the base, which in my mind was the way to go. We didn't miss anything with plenty of stops along the way, but finished in a couple of hours and managed to stay out of the heat of the middle of the day. We also had time to head back to Sails to indulge in the buffet breakfast, which I think was the highlight for my teenage son. We did the Valley of the Winds walk (about 7.8klms round trip) through Kata Tjuta the following day, which is more demanding than the rock, but quite doable for most families with kids that can walk for 2-3 hours. It did get up to 30 degrees, so take water, PLENTY of sunscreen and a HAT (can't beleive how many people didn't have hats), and there are a couple of places along the way where you can refill. Both the Rock and Kata Tjuta are must do."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A bucket list attraction for sure. Be sure to walk around the rock and see the very interesting rock art and important indigenous sites. There are info panels explaining the dreamtime stories in various locations. Tip.....Take some water with you. You will not be disappointed.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,With a different view in the morning and the night it is beautiful whenever you go. The rock changes colour and the rock it's self seems mystical. It is such an experience.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This rock is mind-blowing in its size! We chose to do the Mala walk which was approximately 1 1/2 hours. We viewed the Men's cave & the Women's (Kitchen) Cave. There is an area which is off limits for photography but there are many opportunities to take your photos. The green of the trees and wildflowers made a perfect contrast against the red earth of the ground.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"One of the icons of the world and worth a visit. A lot of little or big walks to do in the area. Great to see sunrise and even better to see the rock during sunset. Also kata tjuta near by is also worth a visit, and the valley of the wind walk is very nice although steep in some sections. What ever you do take water, a hat and consider fly head net."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a magic place, get there for sunset and do the walk around the base (aprox 3 hrs), i did not plan to climb the rock because it is a sacred place for the Indigenous Australians, and they asked people not to climb it."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Majestic! The one word I can describe this place! You have to go to truly appreciate. We visited both Kata Tjuta and Uluru just because these are the only one you should really visit. both changes color during sunrise and sunset and spectacular to see. There are dedicated locations for sunrise and sunset viewing so thing a car is a must unless you have a tour. In Kata Tjuta we did the Walpa George walk which is a good 30 minutes and was the only available walk during that time. In Uluru we did the based walk for 10 kilometres and you are required to bring water to avoid dehydration! I also climbed Uluru which Im not proud (just saying) because I found the notice not to climb it very confusing because people are climbing too and there are built in chaina for it.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well worth the trek to see the great rock. Sunrise is beautiful, and sunset equally so. The base walk is flat and easy but 10.6 kms in distance so go well packed with snacks/water and comfy walking shoes....takes 3-3.5 hours. Highly recommend the free 10am Mala Carpark guided Ranger walk 1st before you do anything else. The info that the Ranger gives is fabulous. ( especially if you get Reece the Ranger!)"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is just a rock, but one very fascinating rock. The clouds at sunset could have been more cooperative but we did get to see it for a few minutes with the setting sun lighting it up and that was very special. The clouds were much more cooperative during sunrises. We spent one morning at Talinguru Nyakunytjaku for a spectacular sunrise. We would have liked to climb to the top but it is obvious that is very much discouraged. Any excuse is used not to open the climb.We were there for four mornings and it never opened during that time and apparently was not open the morning before our arrival either. One morning high winds were used to justify not opening the climb even though the ""winds"" were never more than a slight breeze. Another morning it remained closed due to rain in the forecast. A light rain did eventually develop for about ten minutes but long after we would have returned from the walk up. Aussies did much of the complaining about the fact it did not open but foreign tourists travel thousands of miles for the chance to walk up the rock. It would probably be better to simply permanently close it rather than teasing everyone that it may open when they show up early in the morning to do so even though it will probably not open. There are other beautiful walks to do though. We did the base walk and saw a kangaroo and a Thorny Devil as well as taking in the view of the rock up close. We also did the Kuniya Walk to Matitjulu Waterhole and the Mala Walk to Kantaju Gorge which were also very worthwhile to do. The flies like to get into the corners of your eyes and have a drink so netting for your head is recommended and is easy to find in Yulara. A very special place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It has been a few years but during a trip to Australia wife and I drove to Uluru better known as Ayers Rock. We noticed at the gift sop upon arriving they were selling large hats with long mesh veils that went down to shoulders and laughed.....right....until we got out of our car by Ayers rock and were swarmed by annoying little black flies that was seeking the moisture around your mouth and eyes. Wife lasted 2 minutes before returning to car. The rock was impressive in the middle of a desert but then that was that. I thought of another gift it the shop. A t shirt copying Hard Rock Café logo It stated ""Hard damn rock"" but no café...so true So if in the area I guess you have to go see it but don't expect it to ""knock your socks off it is just a damn rock with nothing else really to do unless you want to climb it which you....we were disappointed"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,So hard to explain the beauty and magic of this place. No pictures or words do it justice. Yes it's expensive to stay here but if you have the opportunity to experience this place I would highly recommend it - it's the most memorable and truly wonderful place I've ever been in my 45 years.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We have visited Uluru twice and would go back again. The changing colours as the day goes by are indescribable.There are several short walks if the walk around Uluru is too much to do, although it is an easy walk and there are water and shelter stops along the walk."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our outback journey from Adelaide to Darwin wouldn't have been complete without a trip to the magnificent rock Uluru. For those who may not know, Uluru is situated about 450km from Alice Springs. The park itself was handed back to the aboriginal people who then agreed to lease it to the national parks for the next 99 years. The park then charges $25 for a 3 day pass. While I'm sure the $25 per person (not vehicle) goes towards the upkeep of the park, the rock has managed around 600 million years by itself. The fact the pass spans over 3 days I'm sure makes it excellent value to a lot of travellers and visitors who can then watch both the sunset and sunrise, but due to our time constraints we could only watch as the sun disappeared behind the horizon. So $50 for a couple of hours was fairly expensive. But disregarding the money aspect, to watch the sunset and the rock changing colours should most certainly be on anyones list. We arrived a few hours early and got an excellent spot, but it did get busy as the evening drew on. There is a road that loops around the rock which is worth the drive to get a closer inspection along with several other walks. Please note that the park closes 45 minutes after the sunsets so make sure you have done most of the activities and drives before watching the sun go down."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well, the weather was terrible with clouds blocking out the sun so no dramatic light on the rock but I was still impressed to see the place in person. Plus, you can get real close through the official pathways so you can see the water holes and rock art. I am not sure petroglyphs would be the correct terminology but they sure look like them. Be sure to bring fly net, There are flies all over especially your face."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"An excellent experience. A wonderful walk around the Rock, self paced and easy. Signs and paths were well established, maps adequately showed where to go and provided lots of information."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A tour to Australia would not be complete without a visit to Uluru. We drove around it - walked up to parts of it - and saw it at sunset. Very enjoyable!
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A nightlight of our trip was exploring the Red Centre. So much to see including Aboriginal culture. We spent time at Uluru and Kata Tjuta. September was a good month to go as it was not overly hot and the days were clear blue cloudless sky's. good times to view both are at sunrise or sunset but all day gives you different perspectives as the desert is ever changing. Spring is a great time to view wild flowers and we were told this year was the best for 20 years. Colours were varied and the desert was packed. Envy got to encounter a snake across a path. You need to purchase a Park pass ($25AUD) for 3 days but is worth it. A must go to place if you can.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Spend the day walking around the rock itself and take time to observe the sounds and sights. You can get away from the crowds pretty quickly and Uluru seems to present a many stunning angles and moods as you meander around the base.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Absolutely beautiful and stunning, exactly what I expected and more. The rich aboriginal culture is shown so beautifully through both the culture centre and uluru itself"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There are no words to describe this experience. If you have the time to attempt the base walk on your own , go for it. We walked for 2.5hrs and only completed a 1/4 of the rock. There's a path to follow so you won't get lost and historical inscriptions so you know what you're looking at. Your efforts will be rewarded with some amazing photography. Bring a couple bottles of water and a snack!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Walk around the rock, but please don't walk on it. Some tourists don't give any regard to the significance of this place."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I feel blessed to be allowed to visit this special place. The walks are beautiful with lots of educational signage. They have done a fantastic job at finding a balance between preserving the nature and beauty of the place and making it accessable to the public. There are also designated sunset amd sunrise vewing platforms which are not to be missed.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Went there one morning to watch the sunset come up and expose the beautiful shapes and colours of this massive rock. There is a purpose built viewing area to see this with the sun coming up from behind you. I know it's only a big rock sticking up out of the ground but put it on your must do list. Also the next night went to another viewing area on the other side of the rock to watch the sunset happen with nibblies and drinks.I thought this was better again .Such a special moment.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A fabulous small group tour around the rock, we walked the Mala trail and watched the sunset whilst enjoying champagne and canapés. The whole place is breathtaking, and the history and stories told by the guides are fascinating. Ticked off our list of things to do. Awesome, as they say."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Great walk around Uluru. Beautiful sunrise and sunset. A fantastic family experience that we will never forget.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I recommend doing the base walk (10km), it took us about 2.5 hours. Worth visiting the rock at different times of day to see different light and colours but the sunrises & sunsets were not as amazing as we thought they might be. Uluru itself is so fantastic that it really doesn't matter."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"took part in a sunset tour,complete with champagne and nibbles whilst the watching the rock change colour at the end of the day. lots of people gather to see this event so picking a good spot is useful.We also did the dawn tour and had breakfast at the rock which was even better despite the 4am start...."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We took a small group 'sunrise' tour (5 hr from pick-up to drop off). Justin, our guide, did a very credible job of describing the geology of the rock, and some stories and features related to it's place in aboriginal history. The next day we did the short ""Mala"" walk and then walked around the rock. All told about 4-5 hours full of walking, thinking and experiencing. I recommend learning as much as possible about the stories and people associated with the rock. It is not a self-evident experience."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,AN awesome place to visit at any hour of the day but sunrise and sunset is a must ! Wonderful at the moment because it has been raining- a lot - so there are So many flowers....
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I am Australian and I was so impressed with the amazing things I have learnt about the culture and the history of the rock. The rock has so much texture way more than you would think.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There's no other way to describe it. Never mind climbing it, just walk around it, We started at first light and took a snack. On the second day it rained, and we saw the waterfalls running. It was an experience we'll never forget."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Been here 3 times now. Never tire of walking around the base. This visit followed heavy rain and the wildflower were spectacular. A lot of water on the track but this also meant the pools were brimming. Disappointed to see the extent of buffel grass infestation as well as hop bush.
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The gentle energy of Uluru will captivate your imagination. I loved the Dream time stories and beauty of the wildflowers in bloom. Very sad to see rubbish just dumped there though but do look out for the Heart, it is a special place!"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We arrived to find that winter rains had brought spring flowers - something that only happens once every few years. The colours were fantastic. People who live here are relaxed and seem happy - and who wouldn't be? The desert is a special place, home to the Anungu who have lived there 50,000 years. We spent 5 days and the low point for us was the Field of Lights, good but somewhat disappointing perhaps because we were with a noisy group who spoiled the peaceful feeling. The high point was a walking tour with Seeit (small group tour) around the base, hearing the stories of the Anungu and getting up close and personal with the 'rock'. Go if you can. It's one of these places that have the power to change you."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Field of lights great and the Rock with water running down after the rain, what can i say. the Uluru Resort was a great base as the free activities where great even the prices of food from the supermarket was reasonable for the isolation"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We just had a 4 days at Uluru, what a great experience. the staff at ""Sails In the Desert"" were great. The tours were all well run. the general atmosphere is very friendly and very positive. just place for a 4 day break"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A bus picked us up at the hotel and took us to a viewing spot. Many other people/buses there. They provide wine and nibbles. Great location for viewing the sunset. No chairs, so you are standing about an hour."
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Until you see it you cant believe it. Wehired a car so you can come and go as wanted. Some good tours were offered. In my opinion, Field of light was overrated"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Anytime of the day is amazing, the colours and the environment were beautiful. But highly recommend sunset, and abit romantic too! ;)"
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Cycled around the base of this amazing rock - a moving and memorable experience. Be sure not to miss the the excellent Cultural Centre. Out of respect for the indigenous Anungu people's beliefs, do not climb the rock as it is sacred to them."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great tour, very informative. We got to see 7/7 of the animal species and multiple times. According to tour guide it doesn’t happen often but we were lucky."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What a great hour spent looking at cute little critters by dark with entertaining and informative guides who clearly love their work. A must do experience.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had such a fantastic experience on the Desert Park nocturnal tour! Exploring the desert under the night sky was magical, and seeing the wildlife in their natural environment was something truly special. A huge thank you to the guides, Stef and Cassandra, who made the night unforgettable. Our guide Stef was warm, knowledgeable, and passionate, and her stories brought the desert to life. Stef answered all our questions with so much care and made the whole group feel engaged and included. Highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting—it's a unique way to experience the desert and learn about the incredible animals that call it home!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were at Desert Park for seven hours today! Had no idea it would be that good 🤣 and completely overstayed. We listened to about 5 of the daily talks, all great but particularly enjoyed the birds of prey show. Staff were friendly, knowledgeable and generous with their time. Had a picnic lunch in the picnic area in the carpark, and a coffee and treat at the cafe. Cafe was classy, with good coffee. Great facilities - impressed by the function centre, and the fact they hire out mobility scooters. Alice Springs should be pretty proud of Desert Park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Helpful and friendly staff, excellent cafe, very nice for our main activity day in Alice with informative presentations"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"An excellent desert park set out over a large area making it feel like you are really in the bush. The bird Avery’s are large and it’s wonderful to walk through and see the birds. The nocturne house is excellent and highly maintained. While we were there we saw the rangers cleaning and checking on the habitat. The bird show is the best. The birds are wild but know when the rangers have food. Great interpretation from the ranger on the types of. It’s and their natural feeding habits. The Survival in the desert show was very informative and lots of fun. The guide explained in detail about language culture, food and survival of the indigenous mobs in the Alice Springs region. There are other items on the program we didn’t get to do but all looked very interesting. Well worth the visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park was an eye opener to the flora & fauna of the desert. We enjoyed the walk around exploring tge different exhibits, taking part in presentations and learning about the unique environment that is the Australian desert system."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent the day here as haven’t visited before. The exhibitions were great. We spent time with Jeromy who was wonderful in explaining the indigenous bushcraft. The walking tracks were easy to navigate. Stopped for lunch at the cafe, although a little pricey, the food was great. Well worth the money and a day well spent."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"LTTS recommended I visit the Desert Park to learn about the local flora and fauna before I walked the Larapinta Trail. I was so impressed with this park, it was amazing. The birds and reptiles was really impressive. The cafe there was nice too."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very educational. The exhibits were well presented and a nice easy walk between them. We caught the indigenous food talk hosted Jeromy. He did a great job of immersing us into his culture. I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting Alice.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I highly recommend this nocturnal adventure. The guides were knowledgeable with a great sense of humor. It added to our outback experience in a way that will be forever memorable.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert park was great, but Park Ranger Jeff made it even better! Thanks for all of the fascinating knowledge, fun facts and answering all our questions. Becs from Darwin :)"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Alice Springs Desert Park today. The bird show was amazing. The talks about bush tucker and the bush medicine were so informative. There were lots of cute and unusual birds in the aviaries. The nocturnal room had lots of rare and endangered animals, and the place is doing a lot of work towards conservation of these species. The food in the cafe was of a higher standard than I expected too. We were there all day!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We took our friends travelling with us here as we've been before and loved it. Set out on a few acres you can wander around the different landscapes and view the animals in thier natural habitat. There are lectures on creatures at several locations. The birds of flight show is a must. Check times of shows so you get the best visit. The cafe serves great food and the souvenir shop has a huge range. We chose the morning as it was not too hot.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As good as ever - if not better. Bird show is awesome. Very easy walking and it has special buggies for the elderly or those who have issues walking. Food, drink, toilets and all mod cons. Clean and tidy. Staff very friendly and efficient. Allow a 1/2 day at least. Easy drive from Alice. Good safe parking. Very well priced for the whole family - one price admission gets you almost everything - except food."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The leaders were very knowledgeable and informative but in a fun way! We saw many native mammals on our walk which was just so delightful. I was enthralled. My only concern was that I couldn’t hear our leader as I was towards the back of the group, so I missed a lot of information. My suggestion would either be headsets linked to the leader or much smaller groups - limited to 6 maybe."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"An amazing experience of viewing threatened Australian marsupials in a protected area. Our guide Bronte was terrific, she was passionate and full of facts about the animals. We saw marla, bandicoots, stick ness rats, yet the echidnas stole the show as they hunted for food & followed up around."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The tour was amazing. I didn't expect to see a lot of animals to be honest, but was I wrong. The malas and echidnas were even waiting for us at the gate. The animals got up really close as well, so even in the dark I was able get a good look of them. Together with the interesting things the tour guide said, this was probably my favorite attraction in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was honestly amazing, and I'd say if you go to Alice Springs you really have to come visit the park. It's in beautiful surrounds, near town and easy to get to but far enough into the bush that it feels isolate and natural. Sitting right up against Tjoritja/the West MacDonnell range, it's a lovely spot to be. First, we went to watch the (free) bird show, which I'd highly recommend. They have lots of birds fly through the stands, over your heads, and teach us about birds commonly found in Central Australia. While we were there, Sophie and Angus ran the bird show, and did a fantastic job. The falcon and wedge-tailed eagle were particular favourites, and I got to get a photo with a snowy owl perched on my hand after the show which was super cool. They charge a small fee ($10) to get a photo with the birds afterwards, which I though was more than worth it and a great way to give back to such a meaningful place. We then walked around the park and saw most of the exhibits. Seeing the emus up close was great (they're huge!), but my personal favourite was the bird enclosures. The park is filled with small buildings attached to large outdoor enclosed areas, and you go throuhg a set of double doors to get in and see the birds. When you walk in, it's quiet and you'd think it was empty, but if you sit quitely for a few minutes all the birds come out and walk, fly, and sing around their little home, it's amazing. I couldn't recommend this more highly, I had a blast. Next time I come to Alice, I'll be back for sure."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This nocturnal tour was amazing!! The guides were very knowledgable and friendly. We saw Bilbies Echidna’s, Marlin, Bandicoot’s and others that I can’t remember the names of !! It was incredible and the work they are doing is helping save the native marsupial of the area and Australia- we’ll worth the tour!!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Loved it .... i did almost all the tours that are included in your general entry ticket... I arrived at 9am and left about 3 or 4pm... The first tour was amazing - the guide was actually from Kentucky but she had spent a lot of time with aboriginal people and knew a lot about Bush food. It was so informative and interesting. We were just a small group - 5 of us, and i learnt so much. The next tour was in the amphitheatre watching the birds - quite interesting, then an aboriginal lady taught us about preparing of seeds, and weapons and tools that they use in the bush.. so interesting. The atmosphere in the park is great.. a little hard to work out where each meeting point is for the next tour, but then i'm hopeless with maps. Had lunch in the cafe which was pleasant but average food.. certainly better than some cafes in Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A terrific representation of the central Australian habitats and their species. Easy walking paths snake through the park, and the place is alive with birds and insects (not in the enclosures). The free-flying bird show is a highlight, with owls, kites and an egg-smashing buzzard swooping just over our heads. A must-do in Alice Springs if you've any interest in nature."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was an excellent way to get up close and personal with the desert wild life and also gain a good understanding of the ecology of the area.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I absolutely loved this experience! We walked around with a very knowledgeable zoo keep who was obviously very passionate about the animals. We had a group of about 12 people and all wore red lights on our heads to guide us and spot animals. We walked through a predator proof enclosure but it felt like we were walking through the desert at nighttime. We saw several gorgeous and very friendly echindas, Bilby, Marlas, stick rats and several other cute little animals I have forgotten the name of. It was a magical experience and I recommend this to all animal lovers. This enclosure is huge and part of a breeding program for endangered animals. This is not part of the day Desert Safari Park so I recommend you do both!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very interesting and educational visit. Some emus, dingoes, kangaroos and plenty of birds around the park. There is also a nocturnal house which was great. However, the greatest is the program on different subjects presented by the park’s rangers."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I visited the Desert Park as part of the off train experience on The Ghan. The park is well laid out and the rangers are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. You learn a lot about the animals and plants, including about bush food and medicine. The highlight for me though was the birds of prey display/demo. It was exceptional – incredible raptor birds for the most part but the interaction was a real experience. The ranger who took the show was funny and entertaining and full of great information on each bird. I could not recommend this show more highly. I also loved the nocturnal area. To be able to see these animals in as natural as surrounding as possible indoors and for them to go about their life without knowledge of you was awesome. To get to see a bilby bopping around was the highlight, and on the Eater weekend. If you get the chance to be in Alice, do yourself a favour and visit the Desert Park. Remember your hat and water though as it can get warm."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Some interesting exhibits featuring many bird varieties, lizards, dingoes and more. Map provided but easy to find your way around. Had higher expectations for the ""Bird Show"" which started at 10.30 am. It was OK but nothing too spectacular, however the duration may have been reduced due to prevailing windy conditions. The Movie showing in the Theatre was very interesting with a surprising finale."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very nice nocturnal tour. On the day also a lot to explore. Staff very friendly. The animals are kept in a species-appropriate manner. Another highlight was the explanation of Aboriginal Life and Culture.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Larapinta Trail Trek Support recommended I visit the Alice Springs Desert Park before my Larapinta Trail hike. I'm so glad I did because I learnt so much about about the arid environment of the West Macdonnell area. This is an amazing Park, worth visiting."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fabulous outdoor bird show featuring magnificent prey birds. Jeremy was a fantastic guide with very knowledgeable information about Alice Springs, it’s culture and wildlife."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a fantastic tour led by two excellent and knowledgeable guides (Krista and Tam, I think). We had marvellous experiences of seeing malas, bilbies, bettongs and echidna. The way the evening is set up, you feel as though you are discovering these creatures rather than it feeling like a zoo. Our guides were great and managed to convey masses of really interesting information - their enthusiasm and passion was a delight. The Desert Park is doing excellent work. Highly recommended!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I spent a morning at the Alice Springs Desert Park. It features the animals that live in the desert in the Red Centre. There are three sections to explore on an easy walking path. Two highlights were the free flight demonstration and the keeper talks. It was nice to see the variety of animals found in the desert.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went in small groups with animals keepers carrying red lightsnot to frighten the animals. We walk for about an hour in the dedicated zone and our guided pointed to us the small marsupials and echidnas, and told them lots of info. Photos without flash are permitted. These turn out well when converted to black and white. Most animals kept in this reserve are species that are becoming extinct and that you would normally not see in the zoos."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,You can visit the part at your own pace but you can also take advantage of the demonstrations organised on site by the staff. We attended a bird show where we learned about different types of desert birds. The keepers have some way domesticated the animals that come in when being called and attracted by a food reward. Everything is done in very safe conditions.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A beautiful place to spend the day if u love birds and reptiles. Love the Thorny Devils and the Bird show. would recommend to go early!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park is set amongst natural grounds. Plenty of birds, some aviaries are walk through. The birds seem used to people so you are able to get up quite close. Great signage and information. Awesome nocturnal house, really big and well set out. Entertaining and informative bird show. Tip: sit towards the back and the birds will fly from one side to the other, just missing your head. Paths are dirt, flat and easy to walk. Apart from birds, we also saw kangaroos, emus, dingos. Staff very friendly and helpful."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Amazing park. I’ve been to many parks and this one is awesome. Great interps, animal displays that feel natural and talks. The nocturnal house is the best I’ve seen in Australia. We’ll dine to all staff and volunteers on a great job."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Nocturnal Tour is a wonderful opportunity to experience what Australian wildlife used be like before introduced species shrunk the populations of our native nocturnal wildlife. These animals get to live in a natural environment protected from predators and we get to witness them. Well worth the additional price adding on to a Desert Park day park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Absolutely delightful! The park was truly enchanting, and the guides were incredibly knowledgeable, making our experience even more enriching. The talks were perfectly scheduled, allowing us to savor them throughout the day. The bird enclosures were so captivating that we could have happily spent the entire day there. Moreover, the cafe served excellent coffee, and their toasted sandwiches were simply scrumptious. I highly recommend this park to anyone visiting Alice Springs as an excellent opportunity to learn more about the local wildlife, country, and culture. You're in for an extraordinary adventure!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Excellent displays and activities. Makes the land, the birds, the plants come alive! Excellent cultural displays and teaching."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"So many desert flowers out, pathways easy walking, the bird show was excellent - a most enjoyable experience"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We were very unsure about visiting the Desert Park but am so glad we did. The presentations were very interesting & it was like wandering through a lovely bushland with several big aviaries full of fabulous birds & of course the nocturnal house which isvery cool. Just do it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Went to the Park and wandered through until meeting a group being guided around. Joined them and found it extremely interesting with lots of information and anecdotes. Guide made sure we got to the free-flying bird demonstration which was really good. Star of the show was a Willy Wagtail that believed he was the boss - but owls, curlew, eagles, hawks, magpies and kites were terrific. So good that we waited until the afternoon show and went again. Easy way to see wildlife and to learn about culture. The nocturnal house is also very well set up and worth spending some time in - we went to the guided tour there as well. Overall extremely interesting and we would recommend any visitors to go there for a lengthy wander"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Visited Thursday 4th May. I was travelling on The Ghan and this was the excurion I was given, not my first choice. I'm glad I did it, the guide we had was very informative, the bird show amazing and the rest filled in time. We also had a buffet lunch there as well."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We cycled from Alice Springs on a great car free trail 7km to the Desert Park. We spent 5 hours there! It was brilliant. Great for families. Dont miss the bird presentation!!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A must-see if you are visiting Alice Springs. No need to take a tour - just take a cab $25-$30 one way if you don't have a car) and pay direct at the venue. (But be aware that cabs can be hard to get at short notice in Alice Springs - we booked the return journey with the driver who took us in the morning.) The bird show included in the price was excellent, and we also joined several of the other scheduled talks outside particular exhibits. The setting is very picturesque, and you get a great inftro to the flora and fauna of the region. The cafe was closed for renovations, but they had a food truck and were doing toasties etc. to eat in the open air, which was fine. We visited first thing in the morning, stayed for half a day, plus lunch, then got the cab to drop us at the Olive Pink Botanical Gardens in town for our next stop. That is also worth a visit, and a good place to stroll around, but not quite up to the standard of the Desert Park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had some 3 hours left in Alice Springs and decided to spend these in the desert park. What a beautiful park! Well kept with quite some animals to see in, but also outside caves. You could come close to many birds, reptiles and mammals that were well treated and looked happy in their environment. Quite often you see all kinds of exotic animals, but this park specifically sets the local animals central in their natural habitats. Also the nocturnal section was amazing. Definitely worth a visit!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a tour included with the Ghan Train. Although it was a large group tour, it turned out to be excellent. The place is beautiful and interesting. There are several areas where wildlife is free to roam and several areas where it is confined for easier viewing. One highlight is the Bird Show: this should not be missed. It is a rare opportunity to see a number of birds of prey up close: owls, kites, hawks, eagles as well as some ""gate crashers"" small local birds like Willie Wagtail, there for the free food. Another interesting place was the nocturnal exhibit. I see they have the opportunity for a nocturnal tour which I'm sure would be fascinating but we didn't have that chance. On the other hand, there were excellent views of many ""night critters"" that I expect would be difficult to see ""free ranging"" even if you went at night. Our guide was of Aboriginal Heritage and gave an interesting presentation on local Aboriginal history but I don't know if that was exclusive to Ghan's tour."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Really great experience! We were able to capture the birds of prey show and it’s 100% must see if your visiting! The nocturnal house was also great 🤩
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We arrived here early enough to see the bird exhibition at the amphitheatre, the show starts just after 10.00am and the gates are closed then and if you arrive late they don’t let you in. After the show we walked around the park visiting the various exhibits. This is a great little park and we really enjoyed our time here, it certainly helps that it is set with the backdrop of the West MacDonnell ranges. We thought the prices were fair and would recommend a visit to the park when in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Just loved our visit to the Alice Springs Desert Park. The walks were pleasant with well signposted areas. The Nocturnal House is a definite highlight suitable for all ages to see and the Bird Show is so entertaining with all bird species well trained. The expert rangers gave us informative talks about all of the animal enclosures and the bush tucker along the pathways. I enjoyed the movie which just brought everything together. Do not miss visiting this park if in Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Definitely a must do on first visit to Alice Springs. Welcoming and informative staff. Enjoyed the shows. My friends who live here have the pass and bring the kids all the time. Kids love the nocturnal house.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We arrived later in the day having just arrived from Sydney and I believe we were the only guests in the park. We missed most of the ranger talks as these occur throughout the day. There was an array of very colourful birds making an amazing sound. The whole landscape seems very alien to us from The UK. The nocturnal house was full of strange looking (for us) animals which we could easily see when the eyes had adjusted to the dark. We wished we had more time to explore more thoroughly but it was still a good experience.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic place to visit. Great access to the animals, especially the bird walk throughs. If you are quiet and patient you can get a good close up views. The bird show is very informative."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great adventure, knowledgeable guides and lots of fun. We were there on a night when a bit storm when through. Rain, lightning and thunder but the show must go on. Once you got past being a bit damp it was well worth a visit. Animals where amazing"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Add this to the must do list when visiting Alice Springs! The bird show was a good way to learn about the birds we had been seeing in the wild and the aboriginal cultural lesson and nocturnal tour included many interesting facts about the region, the people and the animals."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic outback backdrop for a super park. It is well done -- with different areas, easily walkable, and lots of animals to see. The bird show was terrific, and a zookeeper provided us with a talk about the dingoes. A man gave a great lecture about some Aboriginal history. The park includes a great deal to see and learn; while it is big, it is surprisingly compact. Great place for everyone -- include families with children."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Alice Springs Desert Park is certainly a 'must see' location on a trip to Central Australia. The Guides provide excellent insights and the park itself is stunning
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We didn't liked the animals in captivity. We were shocked to see them behind bars in such a small place to live.. Very sad to see this. There are so many other options to learn about the beautiful animals in Australia. The park is overall a very clean and beautiful place. The cinema was also very interesting and the man that learned us more about owls was really respectful with the owl.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited on a very warm day and really appreciated the fact that they were open at 8am and we could spend a few hours in the cool of the day. An excellent experience - don't miss the film at the very start as this sets you up proviing context and information about what you are about to see. Visit the nocturnal house, watch the dingos and there are several 'shows' where the guides talk you through different species. A must for young and old!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Fantastic collection of native flora and fauna. Especially pleased with the Nocturnal House and Raptor show. The Movie theatre finished with an unexpected WOW factor. This place is a must visit when in Alice Springs
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A unique experience showcasing Australian desert flora and fauna in a natural environment. The guides are very knowledgeable, the exhibits and activities are enthralling and the setting is spectacular. Gentle walking paths, well situated seating areas and a diverse programme makes for a full day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Fantastic way to learn and see the wildlife of the outback and Australia close at hand. Particularly the echidna who loved our feet. The guides were both very knowledgeable and the path easy to walk. Got loads of photos of the creatures of the night. My only negative comment is that they need to maybe make an age restriction to be 7 years old and over because we had a baby and a toddler who whinged and cried for the whole hour which ruined it for us as not only couldn’t we hear the guide all the time but also it meant we didn’t get to experience the silence of the night and hear the animals rustling around in the under growth. However I would happily go again - without other peoples annoying kids. The older kids were fine!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My wife and I visited this private park on October 8, 2022. We had not seen any Australian animals in the wild during our trip around the country and saw several in captivity here in addition to some in the Sydney Zoo. We participated in a couple of staff-lead talks, which were informative. The highlight of the park visit was a session in a bleachers area in which a fellow called out several birds in sequence, which flew over the participants at close range. We were disappointed that almost none of the National Parks in Australia offer much in the way of description of habitat or other facets of life in the wild. That task seems to fall to private entities."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The commentaries from knowledgeable staff were great! Start in the morning and allow at least 2-4 hours to watch the bird show, Dinggo history , the Aboriginal way of living from a Native and Nocturnals. We missed the bird feeding in the morning."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What an amazing place, so impressed with this park. We thought we would have a couple of hours here, we ended up here nearly 4 hours. So well set out. Flying birds show was brilliant. Loved the whole experience so much to see and do, so many birds. This is a must do."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I booked this as an ""as long as we're here"" sort of tour, and I have to say this was the highlight of Alice Springs! This place is well-run and very informative. Fascinating animals all around you and knowledgeable staff. The bird show in particular is a must-see experience - up close and personal! Really amazing and informative. It is very near town, not that expensive and very much worth the trip. If you're in Alice Springs, do this!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Wow what an amazing experience. Spent 7 hours at the park and the guides were very good sharing lovely stories.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spent a wonderful morning here. Was surprised by the bird variety. Guides were more than helpful and very informative.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We did this tour as part of The Ghan experience so it had more interaction with guides than the usual tour would have. It also included a very good 3 course lunch which is not available to general entry. This is an amazing park, with an excellent introduction to the local bird life. The bird show is a must and these are incredible birds and trainers. The guided walk around the park was eye-opening, with lots of new information and plenty of time for questions. The day we were there the temperature got to about 28C and the shade was welcome. On a usual summers day at 35C you would want to be there early. Take plenty of water."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a great day at Desert garden. Very clean, well organised. Jeremy the Aboriginal ranger was fantastic on his presentation explaining everything with a sense of humour and easy to understand about Aboriginal culture and customs. Honestly I could have sat there all day listening to him! Well done! The bird show was a must see when you go there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Took morning tour and was picked up and returned to hotel. Saw bird show and the dingos with excellent docents. Bus driver courteous and on time. I had booked the Nocturnal tour but did not go as there is no reliable transportation to and from the park at night. Local taxis sometimes don’t pick people up I was told.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It is a great park to walk around. We spent a few hours there. The nocturnal area was our favorite, but the bird show was worth seeing as well. Definitely worth a stop."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Feral proof enclosures to protect almost extinct Australian animals. The animals are so well trained and staff are knowledgeable and friendly! Must see in Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,It was incredible to get so close to some of Australia's hardest to find animals. The guides were very informative and friendly. A must do if you're in Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We did it all and it was amazing . Not to be missed if you visit Alice Springs. Jeramy was our guide and was excellent. The bird show was spectacular and a definite highlight. Well done !! Not to be missed!!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We did the tour as part of our travels on the Ghan. It was a great stop. There was informative and entertaining native staff. The bird display and feature was really cool. We had an unexpected visitor in the form of a wild wedge tailed eagle that sorta postponed the show until he eventually was chased away by some other smaller and more agile kites. The handler did a good job working the bird and the crowds.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The bird experience was fantastic. It was great to see the display of birds they have and care for. The keeper had great knowledge.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The park was a trye joy to visit. It really felt like you were walking through the dessert with all its beautiful red and green colours! All the animals we saw had plenty of space in their cages and the nocturnal display was absolutely wonderful. I have never seen anything like it! We also loved the bird demonstration - leant so much about some of the birds on show and holding the barn owl at the end was also special... A must visit when in Alice Springs!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Only had 4 hours to see this wonderful park. The layout and displays are made for more leisurely ambling and there are great talks and the bird show is a standout. The talk by the indigenous staff about surviving and history was pretty aggressive and felt punitive though it was still interesting. A great day to be had
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A beautiful park with great staff and lots to see. The highlights include a dingo enclosure (make sure you listen to the guide presentation), a bird show with very talented birds (but could go for at least double the time length) and a very good nocturnal display. Was expecting a bit more of the Australian mammals like kangaroos and emu’s which was something I expatiate see quite a lot of. There were many bird aviaries, possibly too much of a focus on them. In the evenings there is a guided nocturnal walk that you must book in advance especially in peak season. That was very special as we saw bilbys, malas and echidnas."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went here as part of our tour with The Ghan. Had we not done a guided tour our experience would not have been nearly as good, so I highly recommend a guided tour. Our guide Ruben was brilliant. His knowledge of the animals and plants was just phenomenal. He was extremely engaging and I think I can speak for everyone we spoke to on our journey, he really made our experience unique. He had an awesome sense of humour too. We saw an emu and dingo, and those animals within the nocturnal enclosures, and the bird show was really enjoyable!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Highlights of the visit were the nocturnal exhibit, which complemented our touring experience in Central Oz. There were several aviaries which were well presented and allowed you to walk among the birds. The landscaped park itself is very good and in keeping with the region. We were, however, pretty disappointed with all other animals. There was one kangaroo, the emu was ‘at the vet’, the two dingos had been taken for a walk and then were invisible in their enclosure, if there at all. There’s a bird show but that’s on early or late in the day and our visit didn’t match up and none of the ranger presentations were on. It’s a reasonably expensive experience ($100 for our family) and we didn’t feel it was worth the cost of the time with so many other attractions in Alice. Perhaps this is the impact of staff shortages felt everywhere (the cafe was closed for example). I hope that’s the core reason because, if not, you’d need a good reason to go for the money and as good as the nocturnal exhibit is, that’s not reason enough."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is set in a pretty semi-arid environment so it is really interesting to see the plants. The range of animals is typical for this region but the bird breeds in the avaries was impressive. We did all of the talks, which were interesting. The backdrop of the beautiful West Macdonnell Ranges is stunning."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Gorgeous flora and fauna!! Excellent displays! Insects, snakes, aussie animals of all sorts. Wonderful bird enclosures and the best thing was the rapture bird display and talk with wild birds. Walking shoes is a must! Oh and water. Down side, the cafe was shut but you could buy minimal food at a kiosk. All in all a very enjoyable few hours! Well worth it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Desert Park provided an interesting nature walk through the area adjacent to the Tood River and across from the town. It had more potentila but good desert scenery and plants.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We weren’t sure what to expect but were thrilled by this experience. We went to various talks by knowledgeable guides, on creatures of the area, aboriginal culture, walked and saw various displays, watched a wonderful film of the geological history of the area and also experienced their bird show, one not to be missed. Overall a great day which should not be missed when in Alice springs. One also needs to set aside a good few hours, perhaps the whole day. The tickets are valid for the day and so one can come and go if needed in between demonstrations."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Absolute highlight of our visit to Alice Springs! We loved seeing the nocturnal animals wandering around the park and enjoying their space, great experience and so much wildlife!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic tour with knowledgeable guides ready to answer any questions you have. You get to see a fair amount of animals in the enclosure and they are used to humans so they don't run away too quickly. Goes for about an hour, closed shoes are recommended but you can get away with thongs or sandals."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park is a must see in Alice Springs. There are lots of areas of see, outdoors and indoors, including the large nocturnal area made out to be night time. The bird Show was amazing and we got to many huge birds fly in and do their thing."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a great park, I did not he the day and night pass. There was lots to see, did the bird show and a few other talks in the day and then did the night tour that night. We got to see lots of animals bilby’s, bettongs, wallaby’s in there natural habitat. It was an excellent tour"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Extremely informative if you choose to attend the tutorials. These guys really want to share the outback and it’s natural and traditional history. A wonderful educational experience for all age groups. I thought I was well educated in Australian fauna and history, but I learnt a lot."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park itself was lovely, well maintained, neat and tidy, but I'd go back again and again for the nocturnal habitat. Well thought through and planned exhibit with more animals than I've ever seen in such an habitat."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My daughter and her friend went to this very well run park with a fabulous guide. They advised it us best to do before going to Uluru/Ayres Rock because then you appreciate the flora and fauna out there. The guide was so passionate about the park and they really learnt a lot.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A slow walk around this extensive nature park taught us so much about the Central Desert environment(s), aboriginal culture, beauties and atmosphere. Highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic way to learn about the area. The bird show was a highlight and the lovely guides who took us on a walking tour. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and a hat, and bring some water to drink."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is an amazingly well developed and maintained park. I visited the desert park after my walk on the Larapinta Trail to learn more about flora and fauna and was blown away by just how amazing this place is. Super friendly staff. A gem in Alice Springs.!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This place is amazing! Really well organized into 2 distinct areas that give you a real feel for the environment of each landscape. The Nocturnal House really showcases the local fauna in excellent displays, and bird lovers will absolutely have a field day. Definitely do not miss the bird show! I could have spent all day at this Park, if I'd had more time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Gday. Wow this was ripper stuff. Make sure you get a guide. She was excellent. Also go to the bird show. this will blow your mind. and scare the crap out of you. Take heaps of water and wear a brimmed hat. can get hot.. If all good make sure you do a full leaisurely lap. Very interesting info. Oh and very useful knowledge if you go to Ayers Rock and Kings Canyon afterwards. As we did. And spend some bucks in the shop. support the locals.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This must be the best activity in Alice Springs. A well thought out park generously presenting the fauna and flora of the central Australian desert. The nocturnal displays were a real joy. Great guides. Very helpful audio guides. It is not cheap, but it is worth every cent of the admission price. A very peaceful and enjoyable day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great experience. The cultural education talks were great. Interactive. Everyone was friendly. Loved it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The birds are amazing. Great story tellers here also. The things these birds can do with a little training is a credit to the trainers.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The nocturnal house and the bird show are excellent. (Not a place to visit on a really hot day, as quite a lot of walking is required. )"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Visited here with husband and 6yo child. We purchased day entry only as the nocturnal tour wasn't held on the weekends. We did however for $10 each buy an echidna encounter. The park attendant gave us a map and explained where to head to and what times. So first stop was the free flight show. After the show you could have a photo with an owl or eagle. Miss 6yo chose both and it was gorgeous. Then we wandered until it was time to go to the echidna in the cinema. This meant to could sit down and have a close look whilst the little echidna walked around and explored. The rest of the park was so well set out and the nocturnal house was amazing! The Cafe is currently closed but they have a visiting food van between 11am and 2pm. I am not sure if it's the same each time but we had Japanese and it was lovely! Bring the kids and expect to be here a good half day if not more.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Without question the highlight of any Alice Springs experience, the birds of prey presentation was truely special. The host gives an informative talk covering a number of the native birds to the region and on queue each bird appears from nowhere to demonstrate a number of flying skills or tricks unique to the specie. The back drop to the stage is also stunningly encompassed by mountains in the distance. There is a clear visible passion from the park ranger hosts who are quick to add bonus additional facts to the show as a number of impromptu guest appearances happen throughout the presentation with the local birdlife either popping in for a drink at the watering hole or soaring high above patrolling the skies. The nocturnal displays are yet another highlight within the grounds which have so much more to offer."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Fabulous way to spend at least a half a day looking at all the wild life exhibits and exhibitions. Thoroughly recommend for all ages
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Alice Springs desert park is fantastic if you are a bird lover. There are so many at the desert park which is beautifully laid out and easy to get around. There are even buggies for those with a disability. The park is well-sign-posted and there is loads to see. It's not just all about birds: there are other animals to see and you get a real sense of being out in their natural surroundings.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"No cafe as advertised and the cinema was broken so I was bored after about an hour or two. Although the bird show was excellent so I would definitely recommend going to see that. I went with Emu Run and paid $70 which I feel was very over priced. I also felt very sorry for the 2 dingos. Their enclosure was so small, they must get so bored."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were looking forward to a nice day at the Desert Park for our first visit on a saturday. Entry was at late morning/lunch time, served at reception by a young-ish male, who appeared distant, disinterested and unknowledgeable, telling us he doesn’t know much as to what is going on, he works only one day a week, when asked about basic stuff. We missed the 3pm Bird Show as we were 1-2 min late for it as we were not told to be on time by the receptionist, as apparently he was supposed to, according to a ranger we came across at the gate for the Bird Show. We walked around a fair bit, saw most exhibits and the 20min cinema, enjoyed all that, weather was warm and nice. Except for the cold and unhelpful receptionist. He needs to be better trained or find another job!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Em from the tourist centre highly recommended this place and it was without doubt certainly a fabulous day out, the bird show was outstanding the kids still talk about how much they enjoyed it. Great for all ages"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We found this very interesting featuring birds, vegetation and animals from the red centre. We attended the bird feeding talk and also the bird talk in the bird enclosure. The park also features a nocturnal section. Very well done!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Not far out of Alice, unusual botanics in the red dirt. Front gate had a splash of colour with Sturt's desert pea in profusion."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My husband and I ended up staying here for the best part of 6 hours. We just couldn't believe where the time went. We enjoyed the talks we went to and thoroughly was mesmerized by the afternoon bird show. That bird show is a must-see. The park is seamlessly integrated into the foot of the ranges, beautifully maintained with an abundance of birds, lizards, snakes and mammals to gaze at. The park also goes a long way to help you understand the terrain and weather patterns across the central outback and positively promotes traditional and contemporary land management strategies. We would visit again."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We went here on our recent visit. We found it very interesting seeing the different fauna and flora of the NT. Very friendly helpful staff
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"great chance to see a number of desert animals. don't miss the shows which are short but really well presented.All in all, worth the dollar."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is an excellent attraction; our big mistake was leaving our visit till mid-afternoon. We did get to join a tour of the Nocturnal House (arriving maybe 10 mins after it started) and also got to see the Bird Show. Both were excellent, with the bird show being particularly entertaining. In the Nocturnal House we saw many Australian desert animals native including malas, stick rats, bilbies and golden bandicoots, as well as other mammals and reptiles. Performers in the bird show included a magpie, a barn owl, a curlew, a whistling kite, a kestrel and a buzzard. Probably the parts of the park I enjoyed most though were some of the walk-in aviaries for small birds, where there many beautiful birds of the Australian desert lands went about their daily tasks, clearly used to their human visitors. I could have easily stayed on for a few more hours."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Lovely park and a great introduction to the fauna and flora of the outback. The nocturnal house and bird show were amazing. Great value and definitely worth a visit. Perfect for any age.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic venue - well set out . The knowledgeable indigenous staff, who led the tour, were amazing and showed us all lots of native fauna."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Immerse yourself in the raw natural beauty of Central Australia. Amazing experience for all the family. Lots of native flora and fauna, such a beautiful & peaceful park to walk around. Presentations given were very informative. A must when in Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This stylish, low-key park is well maintained and has some of the nicest aviaries I’ve ever visited. It was a treat to be able to sit and watch birds like orange chats, western bower birds and red capped robins so easily, and to listen to the chiming wedgebill sing. It was also a thrill to see a bilby for the first time in the nocturnal house. I’d recommend visiting at the start of a trip to NT so that you know more about what you are seeing when travelling around."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This place is brilliant. We enjoyed it so much we visited twice while travelling to and from Uluru. The live bird show is great and very informative. All the birds are beautiful, we spent a long time just waiting and watching to get the right photo. It is very well presented and very easy to walk around all the different areas."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We thought this would be a quick look at some dingoes. Met Reuben at the front door and ended up staying all day, following him from talk to talk. He was outstanding in his down to earth enthusiasm, knowledge, humour. We didn't need to agree with him on everything but absolutely admired his passion for educating people on what he thinks is important. Reuben is a huge asset to the Park and we loved our day there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Absolutely brilliant - best nature park ever We were blown away by the beauty of the setting and the extraordinary array of bird life not only in the aviaries but also outside we really enjoyed strolling through the different landscapes and observing the abundant array of plants and bird life. The nocturnal house was such a special delight. Loved the bird show. Would recommend allocating at least 3 hours at this fantastic park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Really enjoyed our visit to the Desert Park, loved that it was basically the natural environment that was there. Not a lot of animals, but a really enjoyable experience. Loved the bird show, so clever that the birds are free birds that come down on cue and do exactly what they do in the wild. Have seen a few birds shows, but this was hands down the best I have ever seen."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had the afternoon to explore the park but you can spend a whole day if you took your time. There's plenty of signed local flora along the tracks and loads of wildlife for kids to see. The Nocturnal house is pretty cool and the bird show is a must. You can even have your photo taken with an Owl or Wedgetail Eagle for $10 at the end of the show.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited as part of a large tour group. Our guide Skippy was very knowledgeable & informative & made our visit enjoyable. The free flight bird show was good but only lasted 20mins which passed far too quickly!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We arrived to see the 8.30am Dingo tour, we learnt a lot about not only dingoes but about Australian wildlife and history. The site represents the Arrernte peoples dream of the battle between the dingo and the Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger) which made the Thylacine move to Tasmania. The park is divided into 3 main ecosystems, Desert River, Sand country and Woodland. There are regular discussions around the park all day. We then went to the bird feeding time at Desert Rivers, our guide gave a brief description of each of the birds and managed to get the Rufous Whistler calling. At 10am daily is the free flying birds show, this was great to see the great Australian raptors fly so close to you. There was some great commentary as well. At 11:45am Bird feeding time Desert Rivers The most enjoyable and amazing section for us was the Nocturnal house. This was a large display of reptiles and marsupials, birds, it was great to see Bilby and Quoll. You can easily spend 4 hrs here, it’s a pity the café wasn’t open."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spent a pleasant 3 hours here. The photo opp with the birds is very well priced. The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I experienced the Desert Park both by day, and by night as part of the Partjimma Festival. And it never failed to enthral and to capture all the senses. Especially with the West MacDonald Range as its backdrop. The variety, the stillness, the vastness of the bush and it's inhabitants that call the Park home, were such a joy to behold. And all who work there are obviously fuelled by a passion for the environment in all its forms. Such an educational and uplifting visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I had planned to visit this place for 3hours and ended up staying there for 6hours. I mostly walked around the park with the eloquent guide Rueben, who had a deep knowledge about Aboriginal history and culture. I was so drawn to his stories that the time flew. Also the bird show well exceeded my expectations. I didn’t know they could be so well trained!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Loved the Desert Park. The tours were informative and just the right length (15-20 minutes) and the nocturnal house was AMAZING. Huge enclosures and caring staff. The botany was very good too, so well maintained and weedless. Highly recommend the bird show, absolute highlight."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Visited early morning before it got a little 'warm'. We almost had the park to ourselves. The nocturnal house is very large, well set out and is possibly the best I've been in. Brilliant in fact. The other exhibits are great, especially being able to wander inside a few and seeing the different types of ecosystems. We like to 'potter around' on our own but a guided tour is possibly a good idea for some. Many many photos were taken !! Recommend. Absolutely."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Thai place was great! The bird and dingo show was amazing and the wildlife there is a wide range to see! Highly recommended !
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It was a great way to spend the afternoon and lunch was tasty, too! The exhibits are great, especially the aviaries, nocturnal house and the different types of ecosystems in the red centre of this country. It was a good idea to take a private tour and our guide was knowledgable and helped us to go through the place, keep us to time and help us to see the important things such as the bird show."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Go early when it opens, as it gets very hot. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The lady on the front counter was fantastic. The bird show is amazing and really worth going to. The whole Park is so well looked after and staff are well trained."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"There were only my husband and myself on the night tour and it was excellent. Our guide, Bronte, was very informative and certainly knew her stuff. We had head torches with red light so could see where we were going and also any wildlife. We saw an abundance of betongs and lots of bandicoots, several echidnas and a bilby. The animals weren't too bothered by our presence and were more interested in the food provided for them. Bronte noticed that one of the bandicoots had a problem with one of its feet and was able to catch it, no mean feat in the dark, and took it back to be checked. All in all a very enjoyable tour."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Awesome exhibits. One of the best arrays of animals I’ve seen anywhere in Australia. Would highly recommend the nocturnal house.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had the most amazing time, had the whole park and animals to ourselves. I was in my element, i love photographing animals and i got some great shots"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Large park offering a variety of animals, habitats and a nocturnal enclosure which was fantastic. Shade/ water stations provide relief from the heat. Covering the park took us 2 hours."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited the park early one morning before driving to Kings Canyon. The bird show was excellent as was all the nature exhibits. The highlight was a brief but insightful talk by 'Ruben' one of the Indigenous hosts. Ruben taught us more about Indigenous culture in 15 mins than my entire schooling life. He also personally took time out of his busy schedule to show us all sorts of edible bush tucker. All the other hosts were excellent and happy to answer questions. Im sure visitor numbers will pick up when Covid is over. A must visit site in Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a great little park. Staff at the front counter were friendly and informative. The park was filled with information and the big surprise was the nocturnal house, much bigger than expected from the outside. If traveling with young ones would recommend going early as we left it a little late and ended up walking around in the middle of the day, which was a little too hot. Cold water fountains throughout the walk so will not run dry. Great stop if visiting the red centre."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,easy to walk around plenty of features to see all in good shade pavilions map was easy to read plenty of water stations on the walk friendly staff good cafe at the end
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is amazing. Walk through and enjoy the desert park. It was more green than expected. It looked fabulous the green with the red earth. There are also lots of Wildlife, reptiles and birds to see which lives in the Outback. The huge park is located outside the city. Plan on at least 3 hours, if you don't like to hurry. It is a good opportunity to see wildlife."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"So many shows and activities! I was pleased to know more about aboriginal culture and creatures of the desert. All the park was well organized, and I loved to enter the aviaries to see up-close the birds or red kangaroos. I could have spent more than one day with all that was to see. I wished I posted this comment earlier as that was in November 2019, but trip advisor is stuck for December 2019. Sure It is still a marvellous place."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Absolutely worth a visit. In fact, arguably the best thing to do/see in Alice Springs. I learned a lot and saw a lot of beautiful animals upclose. Don’t forget to bring water though if you’re visiting when it’s hot. There are plenty of water fountains but it’s good to bring a bottle with you"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What a treat The team was friendly and hospitable The bird show was a highlight The park was immaculate Luvd being able to experience Country in such a unique way
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"One of the best things I did in Alice springs. The bird show was incredible and plenty of activities to do to fill your entire day. A special thank you to the fountain of knowledge that is Huss. Your work ethic and attitude were more than memorable and I appreciate the time and effort it took for you to ensure my experience of the park was a positive one. There should be more workers out there like you with the passion and genuine love for what you do, all the best."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Lovely to wander around and see all the animals. The staff were so helpful and friendly. The nocturnal display the largest in the Southern Hemisphere is well worth seeing. Great day had by all. The coffee shop has nice food as well
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I took my 2 boys here, 9 and 12, and it was the highlight of their trip to Alice Springs. The talks were interesting and informative and the staff friendly and helpful. No shortage of things to do and see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Who knew a desert park could offer so much entertainment. The bird display was fantastic. The rest of it was just a bonus. The park offered mobility vehicles for a donation - which gave my mother complete freedom to move around safely. This was a great afternoon - well spent.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Absolutely brilliant!!! Spent the entire day viewing the exhibits and attending many of the really informative and specialised Guide Information sessions on offer. Loved walking around the park observing the amazing birdlife, flora and fauna. Way too many great experiences to cover here. The staff are all so lovely and so informative. We learned a great deal about indigenous history, the animals and birdlife. This really is a MUST DO when in the Alice. Hubby just loved it and trust me, he is really hard to impress!!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The best part was the gophers we could hire to save a lot of tiring walking. It meant we had the energy to enter all the vagaries & ranger talks, as well as have a lunch break at the cafe. The wild bird show was exceptional - showcasing a variety of partially tame wild birds that appeared on cue to receive the food reward. We also enjoyed the site commentaries available on the net using the QR reader we used the previous day at the equally interesting cultural centre (which included the Namatjira Gallery)"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I had not visited this place for many years and it has got even better. Loved the various locations with red sand country, spinifex, dry desert river and open woodlands all connected with great paths. Enjoyed the walk through aviaries, the excellent nocturnal house with snakes, lizards, perentie and the bilbys. Also saw roo, dingo, emu and thorny devils. Allow at least two hours and try and finish with the 3.30 birds of prey show in the amphitheatre. Also many talks at various places and times. Good place for photos of wildflowers."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Really enjoyed this park. We walked past some of the parks own guides, who seemed to be very informative and answering all the questions being fired at them. Sadly, we had employed the services of a local guide (from outside the park it must be said). He knew very little. We felt duped. We wished we had just paid the entry fee, as part of the fee you pay includes this expert guidance."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a lovely park to visit when in Alice and the guides are very informative. Dont forget to look up and see the birds resting in the trees and you must visit the dingos......sorry I am bias as they are my favourite.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We spent a fantastic morning wandering around the park to see lots of Aussie animals in their natural habitat. The bird show was excellent with some very clever feathered friends flying around in the open. The staff are very good & knowledgeable. The talk by Kirsty on kangaroos was amazing & eye opening to this Aussie! A great place to visit & ask questions.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Being on the Ghan meant we had an exclusive tour of the facility - the usual free flight display is a 10am - ours was later and was for us only. After being dropped off at the park we were met by two experienced guides and were given an introduction to the work done there. People with mobility issues could use scooters so everyone had the opportunity to do the full tour and walk. First animal encounter was at the dingo enclosure followed by the free flight theatre. No eagles, kites or falcon this time - we were introduced to a lovely Barn owl. The handler explained that the bird was wary of the tawny frogmouth perched in the theatre rafters and had to retrieve the owl when it decided to fly back to its home. The brief display was great. The theatre has tiers of seating and good views of the handler with bird. Thegroup was split into two and then did a tour of the other areas including reptiles, nocturnal area and raptors. There is a café for snacks and light meals and beverages and also a gift shop. A wonderful and colourful children's playground was near cafe. If you haven't seen Australian animals this is a great introduction - otherwise you can spend quiet time at the café - outdoor undercover seating. Enjoy"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I enjoyed walking through this park. The bird show was great. The reptile house is interesting and gets you away from the pesky flies for a while. The guides from the park were excellent.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We so enjoyed this tour ... as we visited out of season, there were just the two of us with guide Greg and zoologist Renée. We felt so lucky. You do have to book this tour, which runs on alternate days during the week, and it takes about an hour, plus extra time for answering questions. You walk on paved paths through a large area which is fenced off ... so the animals are not totally “in the wild”, but means you will see them. The little mala wallabies in particular would not survive outside the enclosure now, as they are way too friendly to feral cats and marauding dogs and foxes. So, we saw lots of animals, including a fight between a burrowing beettong and a brush-tailed one, over a very cute female ... very unusual behaviour which interested our guide too. We also spotted bilbies and golden bandicoots. Both Greg and Renée were extremely knowledgable. All our photos came out very red, of course, but with technology you can take out the colour for some wonderful black-and-white shots."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the park in the afternoon, so missed all the feeding and the tours, but still absolutely loved it here. Firstly Anne on reception was incredibly kind nd helpful, so we started well. We both like taking photos, so even though we didn’t go on the official tours, we really enjoyed it, especially the aviaries. So many beautiful birds, breathtaking. We also enjoyed photographing the dingoes, walking through the red kangaroo enclosure, and the nocturnal house. It’s almost impossible to take photos there, as the lights are so low, but one of the keepers was putting out food and his head torch really helped. The highlight was the beautiful quoll and the bilbies. There are many little critters in there, including snakes, spiders and lizards, which little boys in particular would enjoy. The park is also lovely simply to walk around, a nice bush walk. And you never know what you might spot. The park doesn’t have a cafe, but has ice-creams and cold drinks. There’s also a nice little shop. All highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"When I was in Alice Springs a lot of people recommended me to go to Desert Park. I did not know exactly what it was, I just went there to see it and let it surprise me. I came after 9:30u am so I missed the kangaroo and dingo feeding, but straight away I got information about the emu's by Jerry. I followed the program on the paper that was given to me at the entry so some time later I saw Jerry again. Jerry is an aboriginal park guide that can tell you the coolest things about the aboriginal lifestyle, the animals and the park. Because of Jerry I really liked this park. Escpecially because he learnt me so many new things about the area and Australia as well. There was also a nocturnal house filled with cool animals and reptiles and you were able to go into the kangaroo area. I also saw a bird show and thanks to the low season it was quiet and chill to walk there (and hot). I would recommend to go to the park, but only when there are free tours. The information that you get out of these tours is woth the visit. Otherwise it will feel more like a Zoo, that you can finish in a short period of time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had a couple of hours to enjoy Alice Springs and therefore we visited the desert park. The part where the night animals are hosted is very interesting.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We arrived in the afternoon and missed the birds of prey show as it only ran in the morning during the summer season (too hot). The ground is very extensive, divided into 3 distinct zones that made up the landscape of the Australian desert. Due to the lack of time, we had to rush through most exhibits, still we managed to see many desert wildlife and the eco-system with the help of very informative ranger/guide and info captions."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We made a day of our visit to the park so we could enjoy all the shows and talks. The bird show was fantastic which is twice a day(we did the early session) we then timed our wander around the park so we could catch all the guide talks to learn more about the history and culture of the area. There is a cafe with plenty of food & drink options we packed our own and enjoyed a picnic in the park. Recommend a visit if you get a chance.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I saw so many animals, reptiles and birds that I had never seen before! I am actually ashamed to admit it. I also learned quite a lot from the lovely indigenous woman who showed us various implements used by aboriginal people since the dawn of time. Overall, I think that this park should be on anyone's list who visits Alice Springs - it's close to the town and is a great day out."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Have been a number of times and there is always more to see. The bird show is a complete delight. I would recommend visiting more than once. We were very lucky to meet a few dingos on their daily walk.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,In Stanley Chasm I took a few pictures that for me at that moment with the right time frame we can get a nice unusual picture of yourself when you are in the right position with the sun behind you
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very interesting. Able to see local flora and fauna. Bird of prey show great. If you have trouble walking use the scooters provided. My husband was sorry he didn’t take it up
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,As part of our package Emu Run picked us up from our accommodation in Alice for our morning wandering about the Park - thanks Tim for your assistance. It was very informative walking around the park and listening to the various presentations. The wild bird show was very entertaining and thoroughly enjoyed by our group. The nocturnal house was great and showed a wide variety of Australia's animals.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went and did the tour not expecting much, but it was outstanding and 100% worth the time if you are in Alice Springs. The kids loved the Bird Show and also the Nocturnal House. Jeremy was a great presenter and could listen to him about traditional practices all day. Do yourselves a favour!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Easy walk in a beautiful environment. Friendly and informative guides. Very comprehensive, sensitive and informative session on Indigenous culture, both historic and contemporary. The bird show was amazing! Highly recommended!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My wife and I visited here as one of our trips from the Ghan Expedition. It was wonderful especially the bird display. We could have happily stayed longer looking at all the flora and fauna..
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I will be honest with you - I only went because a colleague recommended it and baulked at the $37 entrance fee - but once inside was totally captivated. The talks were really informative (thank you Huss) and the bird show spectacular and well done. The nocturnal house and reptile displays were one of the best that I have seen anywhere in the world. Even the gift shop was outstanding. A visit to the park is worth every cent! you come out refreshed and reinvigorated.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park is awesome! The keepers genuinely care for the animals, and have such amazing knowledge about them, their habitats and the general area. The bird show is excellent, made all the more lovely when the local birds try to chime in! The nocturnal house is amazing - seeing little bilbies and malas and quolls is wonderful! I’d recommend allowing about 5 hours to do it justice with the talks and presentations, as well as guiding yourself through some areas."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The location of this attraction is quite breathtaking at the foot of the range. It was a warm day when we visited but there was a good cool breeze. The park is beautifully maintained with good walking tracks and an easily accessible nocturnal house. The Bird Show and Talk was a real highlight. The staff are very friendly and happy to answer any questions.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My wife wasn’t interested in visiting “a zoo” and left thoroughly impressed. They have done an excellent job of displaying the local flora & fauna in its natural environment. The walk through aviaries are excellent and the nocturnal house absolutely outstanding. The grounds themselves have a botanic garden feel. We missed the bird show - but still really enjoyed the visit.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Park is located just a few minutes west of the town centre and offers ample parking for visitors. The grounds are excellent, well maintained with a network of pathways taking you through exhibit spaces that promote the flora and fauna of central Australia. It is a little expensive but I guess that is the price-point needed to be a viable attraction here: the area would be the worse off if this attraction was not here. In particular, we thoroughly enjoyed the bird show: very well done and included in the entry pricing. Allow several hours for a visit here: very interesting and very pleasant."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Full of life the desert park was amazing. As this area is sustainably watered the life from all around is there. We saw beautiful flowers plants and birds. The nocturnal house showed what comes out at night and was full of cute furry and scaly creatures. The robins, chats, bower birds splendid and white wing fairy wrens were beautiful and I was able to get some beautiful photos. Julie oakleigh"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I thought we’d be there for an hour, but we stayed for for hours! The paths are well marked, with plenty of shaded seats along the way and an amazing variety of bird life. The exhibition of flying birds was incredible and to have our photo taken with a wedge-tailed eagle an unexpected bonus. So glad we went there!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Loved the story about the lady whom set it up she was a great person but it was so very barren saw some birds but not a lot of plant life.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We stayed in Alice Springs for a week so bought ourselves a yearly entrance so we could come and go as there’s so much to see, observe and experience here. A special place for birdwatchers, or those just interested in wandering and experiencing the many facets of the desert park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you're looking to learn about the varying habitat types then this is a good place to start. You can wander freely around the different biomes and learn about the plants and wildlife within. Also learn about the local culture of the aboriginal people who live and survive in the desert. Finally sit and relax whilst watching some of the native bird species fly so close to you you'll feel the air move. A great experience but definitely remember sunscreen, water (there are swveral areas to get fresh water/refills as you go around) and a good hat!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited Desert Park with a group of young adults with an intellectual disability they had a wonderful day out. Lots to do and see special thanks to Jeremy and Greg.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The staff are a fountain of information. We toured the nocturnal house, walked through the various landscapes, admired the desert flora and watch the 'bird presentation' in the amphitheater. It was a great day! Just remember to keep hydrated as it can be very warm and bring a hat."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We are on a group tour and visited the park. It was a very informative visit, the park is very well maintained and local guide did an excellent presentation of the basic tools which the aboriginal people manufactured and used for their daily life, digging holes, making a fire, hunting etc. The glass boxes were snakes and other nocturnal animals are kept, was also very impressive."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The desert park is a great place to visit with 3 desert habitats to explore and plenty of wildlife to see. The introductory video shown every hour is stunning. We went in September and the wildflowers were gorgeous. The nocturnal house is huge and there’s a good mix of animals in there. We went to the bird show which was stunning. The cafe was also great for lunch.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Had a great day walking around looking at all the birds and wildlife, I will never look at a desert in the same way again absolutely best day out!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A must visit destination full of entertainment and discovery with a very professional team. A place to learn so much about the central Australian environment, you will most definitely come out a more informed and entertained person. For us, the highlight apart from the bird show, was the cultural information session given by Lionel. We learned so much and it enhanced our respect for this ancient culture and so heartening to hear many of the skills, languages and stories are still well and truly alive today."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a wonderful place this is! So well organised. Great shows/talks. Fantastic exhibits. If you only have one day in Alice, go to the Desert Park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,One of the must see attractions of Alice. Showcasing the desert in all its subtle glory. Best parts are the bird show and nocturnal house. If you go in summer go as early as possible to avoid the heat of the day. Staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park is laid-out by the different desert habitats, so you can visit the different areas and see plants and animals together how they live in the ""real world"". I recommend to spend a whole day or as much as possible in the park. We had 3.5 hours, which was not enough. While during the hotter hours I recommend to attend all the (free!) ranger talks and activities, as they ""sharpen the senses"" what to look out for, visit the ""night house"", and then just wander around again from around 3.30/4pm, as the animals become active again, which makes it so much easier to spot them by yourself. The park closes at 6pm - which would be great if that could be extended until sunset, as the park and the colours become simply magic and make for some excellent photo opportunities as well. - The staff were extraordinarily friendly and knowledgable, the talks and guided walks interesting. - Many benches to rest in the shade and water fountains. Even for older or less mobile people perfectly doable. - Only (small) downside was the map, which we didn't find very clear, but you can't really get lost anyway. - We did not have time to go to the cafe. - We'll come back!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Our tour guide Lisa was very knowledgeable and kept us intrigued throughout. Very interesting bunch of animals and how the park is working to preserve them. The nocturnal walk itself is beautiful.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I really enjoyed all of the presentations the staff provided and the location is wonderfully convenient and so scenic.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A pleasurable morning however without the talks and outstanding bird show it would be a lot more ordinary and over-priced. Not that many outdoor animals (dingos and kangaroos is about it) though quite a large nocturnal house and a good selection of bird life. Really enjoyed the walk through aviaries. Great attempt at developing natural habitats. Read many negative comments about the cafe but decided to go anyway. We shouldn’t have although the chips were quite ok. The tofu vegetarian gourmet sandwich was disgusting. Should have asked for a refund quite frankly. Flavourless, dry ...... cooks need some training regarding flavoursome combinations. I would be embarrassed to serve such. They only do well because there is no choice nearby so it is either this or nothing!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is beautiful, so well maintained and a pleasure to walk around. It provides an informative desert experience with guides and maps situated all over the park. It is ethical and authentic in its delivery. The bird show is excellent."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This show was set in open air scencery with the backdrop of the magnificent West McDonell ranges. The range of native birds displayed was large and all are in top condition. The show is veery informative as well as being entetaini g. Tne birds were not made to perform, their natural talents, attributes and skills were displayed well. This is just one of the many highlights of the park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I arrived at the Park early to spend a couple of hours; I reluctantly left late in the afternoon, my head swimming with information about the birds, animals, plants, indigenous culture, adaptations and much more about the Central Australian region. The talks throughout the day were excellent, paths were easy to follow, signage was clear and informative, the cafe pleasant. A must do before starting any other travel in the area."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This Park is fabulous a must do if your in the Alice. Come early it gets hot. Cafe good food. Staff friendly and helpful. Lots of animals birds
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A wonderful few hours was spent at the Park and certainly could have been there for more time. Displays are well thought out and accessible so you can see what is on display. Nocturnal area fantastic and plenty of space. Enjoyed that a lot of the plants had been labelled. Well designed areas. Need comfortable walking shoes, hat, sunscreen and water. Great that drinking water was available throughout the park so you just topped up your bottle."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Easy access to all of the talks and exhibits. The Birds of Prey were amazing and the bird aviary was excellent. We also took in one of the desert living talks which was just great, given by a true local."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spent a very interesting morning at the desert park in Alice Springs. You will need transport as it is out of town. Around $36 for an adult entry which was a little expensive for the length of time you spend there but we did enjoy. The bird show was excellent- showcasing the local birds including some rather big raptors and eagles- definitely worth a watch. The talk with artefacts on the aboriginies was also very informative and the presenter was excellent. There are a few other animal enclosures but what this place does well are the presentations so keep at it and the rest will improve as time goes on. I’d happily take children here for a few hours.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were a bit short of time so only did 2 shows, the bird show and the Aboriginal talk on living in the desert. We also went to the film. All were excellent. Walkways very easy and map simple to use. Lots of birds to see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park is well thought out, large, and easy to navigate. We arrived in time for the Free Flight Birds show, which was fantastic. We went through the Nocturnal House, twice, because it was so good. Allow a half a day, at minimum, to explore and absorb this wonderful place. The coffee at the cafe was also very good."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A wonderful experience. The flowers were out and pretty. The presentations were interesting. Jeremy was very informative. Still here and waiting for the birds at the amphitheatre
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Things didn't start out well being charged full price for entry even though we are clearly Seniors because we sensibly left most of our documents at home and travelling only with minimal cards etc. A Driving License is insufficient. Pretty disappointing. Signage upon entry is not great, there is a route through the back of the building that is very poorly indicated (and on exit a sign on a door saying use another exit which then is impossible to find) but navigate these difficulties and the experience itself is absorbing especially the nocturnal house. The bird event was fabulous and, by reading the names on plants and asking about others, you got a good idea of things to be seen once out of alice into the broader landscape."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"this is a fantastic place. we timed our visit to make sure we were there for the free-flying bird show, but missed all the other talks and demonstrations. it was amazing these 'free to fly around' birds were happy to perform for us. Give yourself 3-4 hours to walk around this well laid out display."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Informative, entertaining and educational. I have a new found respect for the desert and mother nature's powerful secrets. The bird show was simply stunning."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The family had a great time. Three very tired kids who didn’t want to get out of the car thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Very educational.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went with my husband and sister. I first thought it was a bit expensive, but really after having done the tour during the day seeing the birds of prey wonderful show, and the rest it is all worth it! The show was the highlight for me, a lot of thought has been put in and it shows. We saw animals we haven’t seen anywhere , i suppose going into the nocturnal display at feeding time helped seeing all those lovely animals. We also did the nocturnal tour and got Doug as a guide, it was wonderful. Doug is a well of info and we saw a lot during the tour. I would go again and again and it was worth any penny. People were also were kind."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I didn't initially choose to go to the Desert Park but I'm very pleased that I did go along with a friend. The park displayed a variety of creatures. Some couldn't be seen in the wild (eg snakes) because it was winter but there was a good display in the reptile house. What I enjoyed most was the talks by the guide (Doug) who showed some implements used by his ancestors and he shared his knowledge of Aboriginal customs and way of life. Most interesting.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I really enjoyed seeing the wild life that this place has to offer. There were certain snakes and lizards on display that I did not know was in Australia. It was absolutely fantastic with the photo opportunities on offer and the bird show was incredible. Never seen anything like it and would love to go and see the bird show again. Skip did an excellent job of guiding us all on the warm Alice Springs day. The pleasing thing to hear was that all the animals were all Australian Natives and had been caught around Alice Springs itself. That's a true outback nature park and giving tourists from overseas a taste of our Aussie wildlife. Great job guys
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,If you are in Alice Springs well this is one place you should head for. The exhibitions are well set up throughout the park and it is such a wonderful way to see all the animals and birds. Not to be missed was the free bird show and the nocturnal exhibits. It is a great time to spend a few hours and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Alice Springs. Not far out of town and plenty of parking on site too.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was the second time we (my husband and I) have visited the Desert Park and enjoyed it as much this time as the first. The Desert Park is well designed making it easy to navigate with brilliant displays of plants, birds and other Australian animals. Signs throughout provided in-depth information about the parks environment, plants and animals. We attended a presentation by Desert Park guide Lionel on 'Survival in the Desert'. This was extremely interesting and educational. Lionel was very engaging and it was really helpful to see and hold some of the tools etc used by Indigenous Australians. I/we learned a great deal from this presentation as well as an increased respect for the Indigenous peoples of Australia. Thank you for this Lionel. I highly recommend a visit to the the Desert Park and in particular the informative and regularly held presentations."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Staff are very friendly. The birds show was great. Jeremy who did the talk on aboriginal culture was fantastic and made a few jokes.would recommend a visit or walk
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic park, well set up and signed with lots to see and do. Animals are very well accommodated and taken care of, the park itself is gorgeous. Free flight bird show was way better than similar show at Taronga Zoo, lovely display and birds seem happy to be part of the show and are very close and easy to see. Only (funny) downside was that we and another couple got shut in when the park closed earlier than the advertised 6pm. Eventually after trying a few locked exits and calling the listed number a cleaner found us and let us out.. quite the outback adventure for a managed park inside city limits!!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Make sure you have all day for this adventure. Plebty to do and see. Make sure you do all the planned talks on the information sheet. Plenty of time between sessions. Bring your camera. Plenty to learn.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Personally I found it overpriced and underwhelming. Except for a few endangered animals you can see more just walking around the national park for free. For tourist it would be good though.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Our family of five plus three friends really enjoyed the day. The highlight was the birds of prey show with Willy wagtail guest star! The nocturnal house is fantastic...especially viewing the endangered Bilby. We found the bush survival talk by one of the aboriginal rangers to be the most informative and interesting cultural experience in the red centre. My husband and I wish that this was our first experience in NT instead of our last but are grateful for all that we (and our children) learned. The gardens in the grounds were also very beautiful.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a must do! So interesting. Definitely do the raptor show. We also went to the nocturnal tour which we highly recommend - got to see so many animals including rare species of mala. Thank you Jeremy for your indigenous talk - could listen to you all day, but all guides were fantastic! Thank you!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a great park the bird show is fantastic we did learn a lot about the local birds. Very informative staff we enjoyed our visit you can spend an couple of hours or a day
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is an excellent entree into the outback and the indigenous way of life. The wild flight bird display is outstanding and worth the entry price alone. We ran out of time and missed the nocturnal house but believe it is gòod. Don't miss the 20 minute film at the cinema. Highly recommended.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We only had a couple hours but could have stayed a lot longer. The bird show was amazing. We were all stunned at the show. We missed the other shows as had other plans.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Been in central Australia camping and visiting all the local sights for the last few weeks but today at the Desert Park brought it all together for a fantastic educational experience. The talks given by Lynal were awesome. It explained so much of the aboriginal culture present in this area that we had always wondered about. Also the park on a whole is very well set out and presented in an extremely well located position. Well worth the visit and highly recommended from NT Darwin locals 😆
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We enjoyed all the talks on the aboriginal culture, the bird show was excellent, hubby was bored said not enough animals to see"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This facility is part of the NT Conservation Commission. It offers the opportunity to learn a lot about the indigenous and arid habitats and animals at one location close to Alice Sprinsg. You willl find a selection of habitats, animals, aboriginal culture, lots of free presentations, lots of signposted information,the unforgettable and heart-stopping bird show, and the inspirational endangered species breeding program and Nocturnal Tour. If you get the general entry and the nocturnal tour, there is a saving - also you can do these on separate days. Allow at least half a day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Easy to spend a few hours here at the Desert Park. Listening to the indigenous ranger with his interesting and amusing comments on all things aboriginal - looking for bush food, starting a fire and different bush medications. Make sure you visit the bird show. Owls, falcons, magpies and eagles. Staff have a great understanding and stay around to answer questions."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We planned to go for the afternoon, but could have stayed much longer. Bird show is fantastic, as is the nocturnal house. Unfortunately we were there in school holidays, so the talks were overcrowded. Would have given a 5 rating if they put on more talk tours during peak times. Had to go back and look at nocturnal house after tour as too many people and kids crowded around and couldn't see anything. But then we didn't get the commentary and spotlighting of animals. A wonderful park nevertheless."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Visited with both younger kids and teenagers - all had a great time. The bird show was excellent - definitely recommend
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This park had the best rangers. The dingo talk was fabulous and the cultural talk from a ranger or guide called Lionel was exceptionally good.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The bird show and the nocturnal house are the key things to see and experience here. We didn't get to spend as much time in the house as we would of liked due to a group of school children, but still got to see everything quickly."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Unfortunately we didn’t have much time due to mechanical issues with our hire vehicle but was able to make it in time to see the Bird Show which was excellent and everyone loved it. The nocturnal house was also very good. Lovely clean park and friendly staff.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Raptor Display is the highlight, but the whole park is a :must see"". The Rangers give a number of informative presentations at various times and in various locations throughout the day. Excellent."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We found the desert park good, but did think that alot of the stuff that was in there, we could go and see for free in the national parks. The talks were brilliant, and the bird show is really worth seeing. If you have children it's a really worth taking them, very educational."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The free flying bird show is just amazing and it gave me a greater understanding of the birds of the desert; how they live and hunt. We arrived early at the park and most of the animals were just waking up for the day. Depends on where you're from and your knowledge of the Australian flora and fauna as to whether you will be enthralled with what's in the park. I did expect that people would be able to interact with the animals, like at Australia Zoo, for example; but then I appreciate this Park is a different concept. I would also like to see more done on the dingoes with the establishment of a breeding program rather than a brother and sister that can't breed. Dingoes are an Australian icon and should be preserved and protected regardless of their predatory behaviour. If you're not really into fauna that can't be touched or petted then this is probably not the place for you. It's more educational exhibits than ""cute"" exhibits. It does highlight though that Australia needs to do more to protect it's native species and work to remove those from the endangered list. The survival in the desert talk was very interesting and I learnt a lot about indigenous Australians. I gave it a ""very good"" on the basis of the bird show and the survival talk alone."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Our presenter Jeremy who was a wealth of knowledge and gave us a great insight into traditional Indigenous life &culture, bush tucker and remedies. The bird show was spectacular and interactive"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park was a wonderful educational and entertaining activity for the whole family. My family of 3 boys aged 10 to 14 enjoyed it immensely . I was looking for a cultural experience while in Alice Springs and thanks to Jeremy’s engaging and informative talks I was given just that . The bird show , movie and nocturnal house were also highlights ! As a teacher I will now be able to share all my new knowledge with the students I teach. Thanks Desert Park for a memorable day !"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is well designed with good walking paths and excellent signage set against the backdrop of the MacDonnell Ranges. You can wander at will but the best experience is to attend the many presentations held throughout the day. The park opens early and staff will help you plan your visit to enable attendance at various talks as well as time to visit the enclosures and aviaries. The most popular is the Free Flying Bird Show which is presented twice a day in the Nature Theatre The Park is divided into zones featuring Desert Rivers, Sand Country and Woodland showing the flora and fauna of each area. It can be chilly early in the day in winter so a warm jacket is necessary and a hat and sunscreen is always needed. There is a small play area for children which was popular and a cafe which was closed on the day of our visit. The park is clearly signposted and there is plenty of parking."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A must do if you are visiting Alice Springs. My boys really enjoyed the whole park - great space, set up and layout, with the Birds of Prey and Survival in the desert both excellent presentations. Recommend to everyone."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Every guide book tells you to visit this park - and for good reason. The flora and fauna exhibits are presented in a sensitive and well maintained series of avaries and enclosures. The Nocturnal House is exceptional. Allow extra time here to watch some of Australia's lesser known animals go about their business. The Bilby and Mala enclosure is a definite highlight.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was an amazing experience. The area is really well set out. The staff are very knowledgeable, about the area, plants, and wildlife. You can take your time at your own leisure or follow a guided walking tour. The staff are more than willing to help or answer any questions you may have. There are different times for attractions, which you are informed early enough for you to see. Really well done. Congratulations to all the staff members."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a very good park showing local indigenous fauna and flora. There are numerous talks during the day on flora and fauna as well as the local indigenous community’s customs and uses of local plants for medicines. First talk starts at 8.45am so get there early
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was always on our to do list in Alice and it didn’t disappoint We all learnt so much and attended 3 x of the ranger talks including the nocturnal house and bird show Don’t go to Alice Springs and miss this - fantastic for families and kids all ages
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Had a really nice day here! Make sure get there for the talks the dingo and culture talk was really good, but the best thing was the bird show!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A beautiful park, with examples of desert vegetation communities and the animals that depend on it. A great introduction to the area before we set off on our journey of discovery. The nocturnal exhibit was worth the admission price alone, could have spent all day!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Excellent park, showing native bush and desert birds and animals in a very natural setting. The talks are very interesting."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Fabulous park with so much to see and do. The free flight bird display in the amphitheatre is extraordinary and not to be missed! Really enjoyed the bush medicine and animal tracking with wonderful guides. Well worth the visit
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My favorite event of our visit to Alice. I got there early (opens at 7:30) and enjoyed seeing Kangaroos up close, a great presentation on Dingos and the incredible bird sanctuaries, some of which you can walk into. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. An absolute do not miss based on my visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had 2 aboriginal presenters that were fantastic , their presentation was easy to follow with a touch of jocularity that had everyone laughing. They talked about the medical aspects of the surrounding plants, the stars among others topics. The wild bird feeding time is not to be missed. Various birds from Magpie, Heron, Peregrine Falcon & other raptors turned up on Q for their performance."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Amazing, Especially the nocturnal section. Must do in Alice Springs. Mostly outside and must be keen on walking around as it is situated on a few acres. Very enjoyable"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"visit was interesting, with lots of memorabilia of the old days of the service. The coffee at the restaurant was strong and hot!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This has been the highlight of our stay in Alice. Spent the whole day here on various talks by park guides. Bird flight show is stunning.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Loved the reptiles, birds of pray etc. Nice scenery. Good insight on Australian Outback fauna. Very friendly staff"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Visited with friends, nice easy walk around the park, very interesting exhibits. A nice quite excursion."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,There is a lot of wildlife in the outback but it is not always easy to see because they like to hide away from the heat. Alice Springs Desert Park provides a great opportunity to get close to the animals as they lounge in the shade. The nocturnal animal exhibit is particularly good.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A terrific night walk to see nocturnal animals in their own environment. Cloë was terrific with her knowledge and helping find the animals along with Jeremy. Recommend for young teens and adults. Peter
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Alice Springs Desert Park is a safe and very enjoyable way to discover the flora and fauna of the red centre. Easy walking around. It’s a beautiful park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"With a nocturnal house, a number of aviaries, various habitats, this is a great encapsulation of what gems the arid areas hide from the casual traveller. There are a number of encounters/shows, we went to one with desert birds, Eagles, Kites, Owls, Falcon and more, they arrived on queue, swooped close around us, and displayed their skills and left us thrilled to bits. We also attended the night walk/tour and saw a variety of normally shy creatures you’d never see on your own. Don’t miss coming here."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"definitely worth a visit both day time and when the light festival is which is when the place really comes to life. quite, spiritual, tranquil and beautiful place"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was on our itinerary for the afternoon... We didn't really do our research... otherwise we have known that they have events on during the day that you can immerse yourself in. As it turns out, we did get to a few really informative talks in the afternoon. This is a very safe way to experience a desert environment... don't be under the illusion that it's entirely safe because it's a natural environment for snakes, so they are there... we just can't see them.... well that is ... unless they are in the Nocturnal House safely behind glass. :) It's hard to explain how I enjoyed this ... it sings to you... the environment captures you. I loved the desert plants and flowers... loved how we were able to enjoy different environments within the space- Sand, Woodland , Desert. I am not sure I can say I have a favourite area of this park because it's very immersive in every area....however the Nocturnal House is very special... you will get to see animals you normally wouldn't be able to get up close to. It rained while we were in the park... and that smell of rain freshly hitting the ground was utterly amazing. There is heaps of car parking area, there is a gift store, there is a cafe... this is a place you could spend all day in. AND to top it off...they make it easy for people with mobility issues to get around, you can hire a scooter if necessary."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Yes Desert Park has a very unique history. It’s founder and her reputation and her absolute dedication to the flora and the fauna is really unique. We were about to leave and we spotted two kangaroos. We had a field day taking photographs and getting within just a few feet of them. This made the visit very worthwhile.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very nice place to see the animals of the outback. Good explanation of the environments. We were a little disappointed with the movie which didn't really do a good job of explaining the geology but the bird show was fantastic.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We arrived via the Ghan on a very hot day. Many of the animals were hiding in the shade. Our tour was altered to more of a talk in the presentation hall which was very informative. The Birds of Prey show was outstanding. Many of the birds come very close to the audience. The nocturnal exhibit housed many interesting animals. Highly recommend the park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"all the park was interesting but the highlight is the Free flying Bird Show which is unbelievable, do not miss it"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were fortunate to have visited Alice Springs Desert Park today. It is well worth the visit! The flying bird show was amazing as were the different displays throughout. Finding creatures in the Nocturnal House was challenging and led to a competition be the first to spot it! While there were many explanatory talks by the rangers, we seemed to miss them all but for a remarkable information session from Indigenous ranger, Jeremy, who enthralled us with his account of how these amazing people have survived in this harsh environment."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park itself is not that interesting, but make sure you catch the birds of prey show. There are also a few other animals worth looking at, such as emus and dingoes."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This place is really quite good and we spent 3-4 hours there despite the flies. Bird show was great. Nocturnal house was one of the best we have ever visited. Aborginal guides were very good and gave lots of information. Walking around the dusty paths through the different landscapes was very interesting - dont wear your good shoes though as it is very dusty. Make sure you visit here.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great presentation of desert regions in the central Australian area. Displays, movies and explanations describe desert life in a very interesting and entertaining way. The raptor show was excellent demonstrating several birds of prey (which will fly right past your head,) The presenter of “living in the desert” Jeromy, gave a fascinating and informative talk on aboriginal history and life skills, necessary for survival in the “outback”. Well worth the time (we spent 5 hours there)."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The light show at desert park was excellent! There were food trucks that provided a decent range of food. The light atworks were great-interactive and varied. This is definitely worth coming to see. I did not see the rest of the park and i also didn't see it during the day.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Arrived at opening time and followed the map taking in the talks, SO interesting, and I felt I really got to know a bit about the country and how it’s people lived ‘off the land’. Loved the nocturnal house, bird show, dingoes- in fact everything. The film was great too, this place is a must if you are visiting Alice Springs - which was my favourite place in all Australia!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Everything about the place was great and this was the third attraction we visited while on business in Alice. Not the first place i would have visited but it was wonderful and would be a great day out for family's with out a doubt.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Stopped in here one warm day to gather information, bring a local now we decided to purchase the annual family membership that way we can come for an hour and leave again. Visited that day & have returned already. Great value for money, and all the guides put their own spin on things. Highly recommend a visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Park is ok if you are looking to kill time in Alice Springs. The bird show was great. They do have demonstrations about aboriginal culture which are very interesting.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Th8s was not good. The park seems to be rundown and there appears to be a lack of animals. The wh9le place seems tired. The cafe was on a restricted service as they are waiting a new partner. Not impressed.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Went on an a morning visit to the Desert Park. Park opens early and we were there around 8.30am. Great time to avoid the heat. Great wildlife park. Fantastic Nocturnal House, and Bird aviaries. A bit short on the mandatory Kangaroos, I think we only saw 3 or 4. Heaps of little animals in the Nocturnal house. The Bird Show was something to be seen, with different birds coming out on cue to participate in a live show. Probably 1/2 would be enough to see this park. Watched the movie about the formation of the Mountains etc in Alice Springs, then the screen dropped at the end of the movie, to expose a fabulous panorama of the East McDonnell ranges. Awesome."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"we spent a perfect day at the park. very lucky as the weather was great (not too hot!) and it was very quiet, and felt like we had the place to ourselves most of the time. we really enjoyed the presentations and talks from Jeremy and Huss which were interesting and informative, giving insights to the desert both from the aboriginal and non-aboriginal viewpoints. the wild bird display was a highlight. only regret was we didn't start early enough and probably could have spent a second day there if our trip had space to do it. if you get chance make a whole day of it!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Alice Springs Desert Park is a wonderful place to spend a morning. You can visit afternoons too but you will miss the bird show which is a highlight. The Nocturnal House is a must as well as many of Central Australia's creatures are nocturnal because of the climate.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I recently visited the desert park after living in Alice Springs for nearly 2 years I had heard it was a must. The presentations were very informative and especially enjoyed the bird show and the surviving in the desert by Jeremy who has a lot of knowledge of aboriginal culture, was a small group so he was interactive with us and answered questions. We spent half the day here, would have liked to see more of the shows but was 36 degrees and was too hot."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We only had about 2 hours to visit, so we’re unable to do any of the talks. We really enjoyed seeing all the animals and getting up close and personal with them. The enclosures were very well done and clean. Because we could only stay for a few hours they gave us a pass to come back anytime within the next 7 days to enjoy the park if we had more time. Very nice people, well cared for animals and a beautiful facility."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The park is very good and is more entertaining than a usual park because over the day are a few talks taking place which are all interesting. Even a little movie can be watched.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My husband & I decided to visit the desert park on our last day in Alice Springs. As we had just returned from Uluru it was early afternoon & very hot so not the best time to go - mornings would be much better. Very interesting set up & we really enjoyed our walk around with the Nocturnal House being our highlight.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I have seen bigger kennels.Animals kept without shade,enrichment and constantly exposed to the public.Ok for plants but get those poor animals out of there.Consider getting the park inspected because what I witnessed was well below standard."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Not very impressed at all. Enclosures very small and little shade. You can walk among the kangaroos which must be very distressing for them. They looked listless as they should sleep during the day but people bothering them taking photos. We are affiliated to Durrell conservation centre in Jersey and were extremely disappointed.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Arrived early in the morning to avoid the heat and worst of the flies, We started with the explanatory movie and this was good background. Granted we had to race around to see what we wanted and take in the dingo and birds presentations. Overall, we got as good an introduction as we could have in the short time we allocated. One criticism - additional signage to the different zones and presentations might seem to management as excessive but from our perspective it is needed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Just a short drive out of the center of Alice Springs, this desert park is just fantastically well-designed to appeal to and educate both adults and kids, travelers and Australians. Focused on and designed around Australian ecosystems, one walks around (in any direction one wishes, although it's perfectly fine to follow the map from even to event) through the different areas of geological, plant, bird and animal species native to Australia. The bird free-fly event at the outdoor Amphitheater is spectacular -- make absolutely sure you make it there for that. There is plenty of information and close-up demonstration of dingo, kangaroo, and other mammals, and the nocturnal house and display is enormous and just terrific. Get there by 8 and spend as much time as you can!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The desert park is perhaps something you wouldn’t ordinarily want to go to. However once you are in the park you are able to learn about the life plants and inhabitants in the desert and how they survive. We heard the aboriginal talk and the guided night time desert life talk and both were fascinating and informative. The park is nicely laid out and a beautiful area for sharing the lives of the desert land aboriginal worlds and the beauty of the desert in all its glory
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A beautifully-organized park showing the nature, animals and plants of different parts of the Australian desert. Just the free-fly bird show makes the trip worth it! Fantastic walk-in bird environments, dingo and kangaroo areas and presentations by park specialists. So glad I made the trip out there from Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Getting a little tired now and not quite up to the famous quote attributed to David Attenborough on a visit ""the best of it's kind in the world"". You really need a full day here to appreciate it fully and if you come in the warm months (September to April inclusive) a hat and water bottle are a must. Highlights are the interactive raptor display twice a day and the nocturnal house where you will find such unusual animals as the bilby and the thorny devil lizard, ""molloch horridus""."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Plan a full half day to see this amazing award winning wildlife park and (in the summer) get there early. We arrived just before 8am to avoid the heat of the day and it was a good decision. (It opens at 7.30am). The park visit starts with a 15 minute slightly odd film (but worth seeing) and then you can wander around the different desert habitats. We went to the guided talks too - one about dingoes, another about kangaroos and one in the nocturnal house. We especially enjoyed the birds of prey demonstration and also sitting in the cleverly designed aviaries watching the birds. The cafe was a bit of a disappointment. It opened late and closed early and had very limited food. Apparently it is changing management right now - and that was a shame. But the park itself was educational and really worth seeing. It was a highlight of Alice Springs. Highly recommended!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great park Car park large and park easy to acess 10 minutes fro Alice Springs Park great for a walk around and check out the native animals Fantastic tours and knowledgeable staff five star
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It was extremely hot day, 43C, so we went early and saw most of the park and shows. There are a couple of cold water fountains to refill your bottle which was very much needed. Park guide Anne's Survival lesson was interesting."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We loved the desert park! The bird show was amazing. The nocturnal house is so much fun! Jeremy’s cultural talk was so insightful, his passion was totally awesome, and his stories came with great anecdotes - I learnt so much! 10/10 a world class venue run by world class people."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We went yesterday to the park and had a great time. Very quiet as it is low season and it is very hot! There is plenty of shade as well as the nocturnal area and cinema which are air conditioned to escape the heat.The talks are great and we found them all really interesting and learnt a lot. Make sure you get to as many of these as you can as they are the highlight of the experience. This is a must see attraction if you are in Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,If you are in Alice you simply have to go to the Desert Park and watch the bird show. I’ve been several times and each time has been a little bit different but always amazing. Think they are onto a good thing.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We booked a guided walking tour through the park. Our guide was a local aboriginal lady with heaps of knowledge on the Arunde culture. We saw bush food and learnt about the hard to spot animals of the desert in the 'night house', which is spectacular, even to an Aussie! The bird show was the highlight for us. Free flying birds seemed to arrive on que as from nowhere, doing small tricks that were often just amazing. Do a tour with a guide and make sure you time it to begin or end with the bird show. We loved it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very pleased we visited the park. Offers a good insight into life at the Red Centre. It’s more a place to visit and learn rather than just coo over cute animals. Loved the talk about the medicines made by the indigenous people. It was a typically hot summer day when we visited but there are covered areas for shade and air conditioned display areas to escape to. The park is well maintained, clean and animals and staff seem happy to be there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"After reading all the great reviews we thought what was it about this place that made it so good. I was still doubting that it could be as good as everyone said but after spending 5 hours there on a 45 degree day and being a bit disappointed we didn’t see all the shows is a good indication of how great our day was. We went to the bird, kangaroo, nocturnal and survival In the Desert shows. All talks were very interesting and we learnt lots of interesting facts. There are lots of shady places to get out of the heat and some really nice bird enclosures with so many different birds. Walking around the different zones take time to look at the different plants and flowers in bloom. Outside of Uluru this is the best experience we have had in Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We really enjoyed the park visit. The walk had informative plaques dotted around and I really enjoyed sitting in the enclosed aviary. The nocturnal talk was also a great hit! Highly recommended
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Set in a very natural area with well designed seating and canopy roof .Essential because its hot.The guides give a good explanation of each bird as they fly one by one over your head or swoop down for titbits.off course they are trained to do so but very nice to see them up close.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We came here during a 2-night stay in Alice, on our way to Kings Canyon/Uluru, not really expecting a ton. Boy were we wrong. This place was amazing!! We went to several of the presentations, and were often the only ones there, as the Southern Summer is their slow season. The cultural talk that Doug gave was really very special to us. Neither of us were born in Australia, so we don’t have as much knowledge about aboriginal culture and history. After speaking with Doug for the better part of an hour, we felt like we learned so much, and have such a respect for the local indigenous communities. The Desert Park is a must-do for couples, single travelers, and families. We thought we’d spend an hour or two, and ended up spending 3-4 hours absolutely enthralled."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This Desert Park/ Wildlife park is one of the best I've visited. Well worth the admission cost with many activities available throughout the day. The Free flying bird show is a must with a local willy wag tail steeling the show. Go early morning while its cool and take your time winding through the park and its excellent aviaries and other exhibits. The park is well equipped with drinking water stations some are even refrigerated. The attached cafe provides basic food like chips and sandwiches plus cold drinks.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Not to be missed park with lots of native wildlife. You need to watch the time and attend the presentations to get most of the park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited the desert park as one of the excursions from the Ghan train. Thouroughly enjoyed the performance given by the ranger and the birds. Also walked through the park and learned about the trees and wild life. Thoroughly recommend a visit.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is superb to visit. As well as having many attractions on the various paths through the park look out and don't miss the excellent presentation slots covering the various areas of the parks and wildlife by the staff. Special call out to Jeremy, Matty and also the people doing the falcon presentations"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This park is a must when visiting Alice Springs. The bird show was amazing with wild birds coming to the ranger to the sound of a whistle. An aboriginal lady told us about bush food and showed us tools that they make and use. A large walk in bird aviary was very enjoyable as was seeing dingoes up close. The cafe provided nice food and was well received after a few hours spent walking around.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a nice place to go for families and kids for the Birds of Prey Show ( we saw it,WOW) and for various other animal shows. We went primarily for the bird life we saw both in and out of enclosures ( aviaries). There is a side of the park which is wooded and it has fantastic birds in aviaries. With the day pass we went to see the desert half with the bird show in the morning, left the park for a few hours, and came back in the afternoon to see the wooded side. There are special nocturnal shows that draw a big crowd."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a wonderful day out! To kick things off we attended the bird show at 10am which was informative, captivating and a great way to start the day. Only complaint was it was not long enough hahah. At 10.30 we made our way to the Kangaroo Tale talk which was ok, not much enthusiasm from the guide but still good if you don't know anything about kangaroos. To end our day, before walking around the park, we attended the 11am Survival talk at Awaye Flat which was my favourite part of the day. Doug was knowledgable, inspiring, gentle and a great teacher. Listening to history dating back over 30,000 years (in 40 mins) of his people, our First Nations people of Australia was an honour. Mparntwe (Alice Springs) is a sacred area to Arrernte people so we must respect it. When you respect the land, the land respects you. Tip of the day: Listen, do not ask questions. Thanks Desert Park for a great day out!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I came to Alice Springs for a different reason but ended up having a most wonderful experience at the Desert Park. I called ahead about a nocturnal tour and was told they would do it with just me! It was such a great tour around the grounds with my own personal red light torch and a personal touch by Lucky and Caitlin who took me around & were very kind and knowledgeable! I saw every animal on their information booklet which made me super happy. I’m glad I went and supported their park and conservation efforts!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This zoo covers a pretty large area so they can give the animals lots of space. Birds are held in aviaries so the birds can fly. Some of them were walk-in aviary where the birds did have much space and the tourist can view them without netting or glass. We could also walk between the kangaroos. We did visit on a hot afternoon so several animals did hide in the shade or were not very active. So in some sections it did look like nobody was home. Several wild birds did choose to be here. I did like in particular the Nocturnal House; better than the Reptile Centre. We spend over 2.5 hours here but if it was not that hot we would have stayed longer. If you want to join the activities you need much more time. We did only see the bird show. This was by far the best zoo we did visit in Australia. Recommended! Note that the café does close at 4PM.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Alice Springs Desert Park was well worth visiting. Excellent displays and interesting presentations. The native plant display throughout the park was spectacular and the bird show is not to be missed. Definitely allow at least 2 hours to visit this Central Australian attraction.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert park has some interesting shows throughout the day but by far the best was the birds in flight. This show is one of the earlier ones (10am in November) and has the birds flying about the crowd in an outdoor arena whilst the talk about each one and show off their natural abilities. Great natural exhibits throughout with natural flight cages you can enter and see if you can spot all the birds etc they say is in there. Lizards, fish and nocturnal exhibits are all excellent. Disappointing that the eagle experience does not run all year and after the flight show none of the bird breeds in that show can be seen in the park. No real gift shop either"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Visited here in November and it was a great experience. From the moment I walked in to the shows, guides and grounds was so glad I came. Hot tip: if you don’t have a car book the return transfer from your hotel and including entry"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If visiting Alice Springs, the Desert Park is a must see attraction. Make sure you go when they are have the birds of prey show, just amazing. Beautiful gardens with all the native trees and shrubs, a must visit location."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Entrance fee for AUD 36, there are discount or concession in Australia for local seniors, the park was almost empty. Highlights: Desert Rivers, there were numerous bird houses, Woodland, there were at least 4 lazy Kangaroos having their siesta, harmless, and then the busy Emu, Our personal favorite was the Sand Country because of the red sand itself and the lovely flora and fauna, the whole area is very instagramable. Thanks to the weather, it was not hot and sunny. This is definitely the highlight of our stay in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I visited the Desert Park to attend the Parrtjima Festival of Light in September and was not disappointed. The Festival was absolutely magical - it lit up the Desert Park with beautiful Indigenous art in a number of different installations and also showcased local Indigenous culture - all for free! And shuttle buses were provided to get you there and back. I couldn't recommend the experience enough.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This park opens at 7.30 which gives you an idea of when us the best time to visit. We went on a cool cloudy day. The bird show is a must to see as is the nocturnal house and the aviaries. Great place for young and old. There is a new playground which the kids enjoyed.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park captures the true feeling of our amazing outback, from all the creatures hidden from view in the wild to the superb bird show. This one of the highlights of our outback journey on The Ghan. Very informative especially the indigenous aspect of it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A highlight of our visit to Alice Springs. Although very dry the park it is an excellent place to get a true feel of the outback. It is very accessible with wide pathways and easy walking. The Bird Show is amazing and the nocturnal house has a great display. We visited during the light festival Parrtjima, the only Indigenous festival of its kind which was wonderful."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We went on an organised tour and walked through the park with a guide. Pure bred dingoes were a surprise as most are now interbred with feral dogs. The bird show was a standout with birds flying in to be shown and discussed. The nocturnal house was surperb with some highly endangered animals being saved from extinction through the work here. Well worth a visit from locals and overseas visitors.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Can only describe the Alice springs desert park as one of the highlights of our tour so far very well laid out informative. The bird show was excellent. This Park is another must see especially if you have children they will learn so much about the animals of central Australia and so will you. Not to be missed.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Just out of town at the base of the rangers, this fairly expensive desert wildlife park is a wonderful place to get a feel for this remote and beautiful region. Great exhibits, a large and interesting itinery running throughout the day, and a quirky and fascinating bird show, make the trip here great value. In the warmer months it would seem to be the earlier the better. Beautiful place."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had an amazing morning here at Alice Springs Desert park with our guide. It was a warm and lovely day and we saw all sorts of animals and birds and outback plants and trees. I highly recommend visit to this park if you’re in the area.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The kids absolutely loved it. Great displays, wonderful guides and excellent bird show. We particularly loved our guides Jeremy at the survival in the desert and Matthew at the dingos and emus."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My husband and I went to visit the desert park and it was AMAZING! The variety of birds they have is fantastic. The park is also immaculate. And Jeremy was great!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Go early and allow 3-5 hours to hear all the presentations and see all the exhibits. The Reptile Enclosure is a must-see. Excellent layout of the whole centre. Great guides with amazing local knowledge and stories (thanks Jeremy!) Remember your sunscreen, a wide brimmed hat and plenty of water. You will never look at the desert in the same way again! Highly recommended"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What a beautiful park to visit from the moment you step in amazing native plants and trees in a fabulous setting.The Bird show is very entertaining and a bit different to ones we have seen previously.The Nocturnal room also very good with so many species to see.The talk by a local Indigenous woman was also very good and really interesting with lots of things to look at that were passed around.We also had the opportunity to go to the free light show in the evening and this was absolutely out of this world !!!!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Fabulous cross between kids and adult interests. Garden and animals and birds. You could spend all day in the Nocturnal room. We were there around midday and it has to be feeding hour because every single display was on the move. Fascinating. The bird life was sensational also. My son so wanted to see Dingos. Thats why we went.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great place to see some of the animals and reptiles in the desert, many of which are nocturnal. However, it is an even better place to see the colourful birds of the Australian desert. The 'bird show' with the birds of prey is also well worth visiting."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We arrived at the park early to catch the first talk, and for the first hour and a half almost had the park to ourselves. The talks were excellent and we really enjoyed seeing all the birds and the ranger talks. The free flight bird show was the highlight. We spent 3 hours at the park. Our only challenge was getting there without a car, in the end we had to go by taxi which made the cost a little higher."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My husband and I visited this park this year while travelling on the Ghan. The knowledge given to us was exceptional and also the nocturnal part showed us what the desert is like at night. A wonderful guided walk through the desert areas describing various plants as well as a wonderful bird show and aviary.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited the Alice Springs Desert Park as an off train excursion from the Ghan. Our guide was very knowledgeable. The highlight was undoubtably the Birds of Prey flight exhibition. We would love to have stayed longer and explored further.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a lovely experience, amazing to see such incredible wildlife and the park was beautiful. Everything was so clean and the staff were so informative"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was listed as a off train experience from the Ghan. We were taken by bus and introduced to our guide for the morning. He was very knowledgable and pointed out all plants and animals. Very varied and interesting. The great end to this tour was the birds of prey flying very close and under the seating canopy. This was made more spectacular by the McDonald mountain range backdrop
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Excellent light show on the Backdrop of McDonald Ranges. This is an annual event (similar to Vivid in Sydney). Alice Springs is a perfect venue as the night sky is so clear and temperature is mild.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Absolutely wonderful morning spent here. Come early and move about with the tour guides - they do a talk every 30 minutes or so. Don’t miss the bird show @10 - just amazing! Great playground for the kids. Plenty of parking, you can also take the hop on hop off shuttle. Birds, animals, plants, indigenous bush tucker - everything covered."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We were on a 3 month trip around NT and SA and had heard that this park was good value for the money. We were not disappointed. Great for couples or families with young children.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,You just wouldn't know what is behind the entrance to this park. There is an extensive system of paths and enclosures to view birds and reptile. The reptile house is enormous and houses a huge range of snakes and lizards in nocturnal environment. There are ranger talks and plenty of information. The entrance fee is inclusive for the entire day so you can calm and go as you wish.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had such a great morning at the Desert park. We got there early to explore before the much anticipated bird show. The staff were friendly, entertaining and knowledgeable! Grounds were well kept, authentic and easy to get around. Great day out with kids."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We weren’t sure what to expect but it was fabulous. Like a concentrated version of central Australia in o e accessible place. So many beautiful birds and plants to be seen up close, as you walk around. Also kangaroos, emus and lizards. And the shows that the guides put on were excellent, including the indigenous man who talked about aboriginal implements and life in the bush. Great day out. We all loved it!!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A really good experience which shows a diverse array of the local flora & fauna in a very natural environment.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Unexpectedly, the bird show was a real highlight of our journey through Central Australia. Be sure to get there 20mins early or you may miss out. Our family really enjoyed touring through the rest of the park - the bird enclosure was fantastic and the nocturnal section was full of the cutest little critters - and a few scary ones!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Loved this Desert Park. Great to view the animals and the Flying birds of prey. Great displays and info. Staff very enthusiastic and helpful. A must to visit
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We went for a few hours and we had a great time. It is really hot but there are numerous structures that provide plenty of shade at each exhibit. Highlights for us was Ranger Jeremy’s talk on Aboriginal culture and bush food as well as the Nocturnal House- excellent
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Well worth the price. Beautiful flowers, educational signage, and a great bird show. Get there early to avoid the heat and crowds."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a great park to see what really goes on in a desert. Make sure you get to see the live bird show. From Herons to Wedgetail eagle. Great cultural place to visit.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great desert experience. We did a guided tour which I would recommend as we learned a lot about the animals, the uses of many plants and indigenous culture. I don’t think I would have got as much out of the park looking on my own. The flying bird show was a highlight. I also loved the red sand and the wild flowers. The Rangers are very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The finale to the movie is amazing. Don’t forget a hat, sunscreen and water - it gets very hot."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very much enjoyed the Desert Park and formed a greater appreciation for the mysteries and magic of the semi arid landscape and bush. Don’t miss Jeremy’s talk on his people and bush survival skills. He is a good story teller - engaging and knowledgeable. Great to see Indigenous names, presence and influence in this Park and it’s respect for Aboriginal culture and country."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We should have got to the desert park a little earlier in the day, we visited in August and at 11am it was already very hot in the sun, however there are lots of shady areas and displays where you can get out of the sun. We loved it. The red, red earth, so amazing to see and great to see all the desert creatures up close. Look for the Chiming Wedgebill and wait for his song - it's amazing! Sounds like a ring tone! You can definitely spend a couple of hours here and won't regret it!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Just amazed to see all the different plants, birds and reptiles. Well laid out and really enthusiastic people that work there. Make sure you allow plenty of time as there is a lot to look at. Also, wear sunscreen and hats and take water - it is a hot place. I think they could have made a lot more money (to keep improving this park) if they had a souvenir shop. P.s . don't forget the camera 😉"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Grandparents and 16 year old grandson really enjoyed the diversity this park offered. There is a world of different desert environments each housing plants and animals housed in their habitat environment. There are many varieties of birds which nest and fly around in the park and also can be found in habitat enclosures. The nocturnal area was outstanding. We saw 4 presentations out of many more that are at the park, 13 in total. These included the free flying birds show, and 2 talks by Jeremy about indigenous survival in the desert and indigenous plant medicine. Jeremy was captivating , funny and extremely knowledgeable. Both his talks made our day. We spent 6 hours at the park as there are many shows to see. Start early if you want to see them all. Opens 8am."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had a brilliant day out at Alice Springs Desert Park. We attended quite a few of the informative talks by Jeremy and other presenters. I would recommend arriving early if possible to make the most of your day. There are a mixture of Australian animals to see and the norturnal house was fantastic. We also loved the bird show and Jeremys talk on the living desert. Affordable lunch options. Highly recommend!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Alice Springs Desert Park. The park has been wonderfully put together and we spend many hours exploring the different areas. We loved just sitting in some of the aviaries and watching the birds. The bird show too was amazing as was the nocturnal display. Love the way they have replicated central Australia with the plants and animals and set the park out so you can walk through the different zones. The indigenous talks were enthralling and very informative. A must see park very well done to all.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We attended on 23/9/18 based upon a local recommendation. Succinctly, this attraction is such that if you only have one day in Alice, then spend most of it here. Moving beyond the impressive aviaries, enclosures and auditoriums, Desert Park is one of the most organised well set out attractions that I can imagine. There are frequent clean toilets, ample water stations and well formed clearly marked wheelchair friendly tracks between individual attractions. Make sure you don’t miss the guided talks- we did 3 with Neil who is very knowledgeable. The free flying bird show is another unmissable highlight. “Survival in the Desert” talk delivered by a local lady is an enthralling talk scheduled for 40 minutes, but she is so interesting I could easily have listened for a few hours. We spent 5 captivating hours at Desert Park. Not to be missed!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Close to the town, this is a great place to visit if you like wildlife. The staff are very knowledgeable and the presentations are very interesting. Dingo, emu and red kangaroo are on site and there is an aviary and a nocturnal animal centre."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Situated close to town the Desert Park is great value as it has lots to see & do. The park is well set out with activities & wildlife viewing throughout. Time your visit to see the free bird flight show. It’s interesting, informative & well staged. Getting up close and personal with an eagle is also worth the additional cost. The wildflower section is currently in full bloom & stunning with the back drop of the ranges. Don’t miss the movie in the cinema, it certainly adds to the experience & understanding of the landscape, very well done! The staff friendly & helpful. Allow at least 2-3 hours."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Limited animal displays with pleasant talks by keepers. Dingo, emu, reptiles. Great live bird show in an open amphitheater. Café with some food, drinks, ice rlcrw. Good place for young children to walk around."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a big highlight of our recent visit to Alice Springs. We missed the first few shows, and got there at 10.00 am in time to see the free flying bird show. This was so much better than I thought it would be. We spent 5 hours there, and could have been there for a couple of more if we had got there at 7.30 am when it opened. The amount of birds there was incredible, and learning about native plants, and the visit to a very large nocturnal house with a guide was great. It is dark inside and so with the guide who uses a red torch it makes it so much easier to see some of the desert animals"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Desert Park is well worth a visit, allow 1 -2 hours to see it all. The bird show is on at 10am and 330pm, arrive 15 mins before the show is due to start. We also enjoyed the bird enclosures that had birds flying freely in a natural setting. The Noctural House is amazing ... you can see noctural animals such as native mice, snakes, owls and bilbies."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Luckily fellow travellers told us about this park and we spent a whole day there. Beautifully laid out and maintained the Rangers talks were so informative particularly Doug who gave us such a great talk. We could have listened to him all day as he had so much information to give us and was highly entertaining. Would highly recommend an all day visit. Don't miss it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,An excellent facility. Friendly and knowledgeable staff and very well presented displays. We were particularly impressed by the bush medicine lecture and the nocturnal area.I would particularly recomend for those with young children or those whose with limited mobility.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Beautiful place to spend a day. Was a little disappointed with the choices for lunch, as a vegetarian all I could have was hot chips"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had just 1h30 mins to visit the park because it was closing, but I would say probably the time is enough. The dingos were sleeping under the sun, you cannot get near to them clearly but is good enough to take some nice photos. The emus were moving around and here and there you could see them and take pictures. We arrived just in time for the kangaroos speech and that was really nice. The guide explained quite some details about these animals and there is actually no fence, so if you stay in the trail depends quite a lot were they are, but these animals move quite a lot when active, so we had plenty of opportunities. The space they have is quite big and it does not look like a zoo, this is really a park where the animals are at open air and they can move more or less freely. I really enjoyed it and I recommend to have a visit. The only improvement possible is to dispose a bus maybe when closing at least to link with the city that is 7 km away."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Spent 3 hrs wandering the park and learning about Aussie eco culture. This place is not a zoo so don’t expect to see abundance of animals but appreciate that it is an education on our great countries evolution of our flora, fauna, environment and future sustainability. Bird show is a must. Cafe also great place to sit for a drink, coffee, meal and let the kids spend time in the playground."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to learn about the Australian flora and fauna. Informative guides and plenty to see. The flying birds show was fantastic
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Beautiful and interesting place to spend a few hours. The ranger talks were fascinating and the bird show is amazing. The bird enclosures are a highlight, and the gardens and the birds they attract were wonderful. Only minor disappointment was the poor selection of food at the cafe. I was sorry that we didn't have more time than the four hours we were there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited the park later in the afternoon thinking there wasnt much to see bit we were mistaken. We stayed until the park closed as there is so much to take in! The herbal medicine talk and bird show were standouts! All the staff were super friendly and very knowledgeable. A must see if in Alice!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great place to start your NT trip, to see wildlife and plants of Central Australia and get a feeling of the outback. We came there early in the morning to spend a recommended 3-4 hours and finished spending the whole day. Very pleasant and relaxing experience. Park is set in a beautiful location with orange-red MacDonnell Ranges on the background and lots of bushes in bloom in mid August, providing a startling contrast with red soil and cloudless blue sky. Morning 10am birdshow was really nice, with local originality and somewhat different from Melbourne-Sydney zoos similar shows. Nocturnal house in Desert Park is outstanding. Probably the best I have seen in Australia. All animals and birds we very active and we spend hours in a cool dark building returning a few times and checking on different enclosures. I also highly recommend to see the movie. It is about 15-20min long and is very good. Its “grand finale” was utterly spectacular and unlike anything I have seen or expected. Imagine the last scene of the movie as a striking panoramic view of MacDonnell Ranges, then music ends and the whole wall-sized screen starts slowly sliding down revealing identical picture of real MacDonnell Ranges in front of you! If you come to the cinema in the late afternoon (we were about 4pm), an evening light intensifies the red colours of the rocks and blues of the sky, making it a really breathtaking and unforgettable movie ending. When you walk through the park you can't help noticing how much labour and love was put into its creation. From park layout and all enclosures to children playground and information boards – all is very carefully planned and wonderfully made. All graphics are so funny and cute, I kept taking photos of them. All amenities are very clean, well stocked and conveniently located. Staff at the cafeteria is very pleasant and friendly. All in all I highly recommend to visit the Park to everyone. There is no way anyone could see so many animals and birds in a wild even if you spend months travelling the country. We were camping for over a week (between Alice Springs and Yulara) after visiting the Park and haven't seen much of the wildlife – apart from numerous brumbies, a few rock wallabies and lone dingo pup, not even as a roadkill (thankfully). So, if we did not visited Desert Park, we would leave Red Centre with the firm believe that no one lives there :) My advice – take your time, do not rush and your will see a lot. I understand most tourists are on a tight schedule, but if covering large distances “for a record” - “I've been there” is not a main objective of your holiday, follow “less is more” approach and you will enjoy your journey much more."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great park! Very informative if you want to learn about our wild desert animals and survival in the outback .Would reccomend for family's to see it. Great learning experience for kids and Adults.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,There are set times for certain attractions here. Get there at 830am to make the most of it. Cafe had ok selection of pre made sandwiches
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is such a wonderful place. I would absolutely recommend it to everyone. The ranger who guided us is called Doug: he is a local indigenous man and had so much knowledge to share. He taught us about many of the trees, flowers and plants that are local to the area, as well as how the local people would use them as food, tools and medicine. He also explained some of the cultural traditions - he was so willing to share his culture and knowledge with us. We visited a nocturnal house, with rare and exotic animals, reptiles and insects. The bird show was spectacular: a number of different types of birds flew right over my head. There is also a good cafe."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"One of my favorite places in Alice, I would go once a week if I could. Beautifully designed and maintained with so much to see, 2 hours is rushing it. The flying bird show is a must along with the nocturnal house and the aviaries I just like to get lost in. Enjoy"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Superb bird show, wonderful exhibits, very informative. The presentations were witty and educational."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Allow plenty of time to really enjoy the park. We thought a couple of hours would be enough to see everything, how wrong we were. There are three desert habitats to explore - sand, woodland and desert rivers. The Nocturnal house is well worth seeing as is the free flying birds of prey. The staff are very friendly, passionate about their topics and helpful. Don’t miss this."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spent a lovely afternoon here. Highlight for me was the nocturnal house which is excellent. Really well done. Also the sand country area which was in full bloom attracting lots of wild birds. The wild birds in flight show was also very good showcasing the very best of Australian wildlife. We saw the filmshow as our last part before leaving in the afternoon and that was fantastic too. Very good use of the surrounding features. Very glad we visited. Would highly recommend.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a beautiful place to see all of the wildlife and plants from central Australia in a small facility and in just a few hours. The displays are very well done and as natural as possible, and the information on all of the birds, animals and plants is well presented and clear. The bird show is Really worth seeing and is a highlight of the visit together with the aviaries and nocturnal house. If you have more time there are also several movies and other displays, but this would require a visit for most of the day if you have the time available. The staff seem very passionate about the place and as always have the central Australian charm of being friendly and welcoming. It was a great treat to spend an afternoon at this place."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very disappointed paid $50 for two and saw very few animals. Some birds. couple dingos, couple nocturnal animals. Very disappointed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Had a great date here. Absolutely perfect and the staff were super efficient. I apologise for not remembering names. We spent a full day walking. They even had rent a gopher. A great idea as there is a lot of walking to do. We stuck around for the afternoon birdcshow and was not disappointed. If you do decide to go be sure to pack a hat. Sunscreen and were shoes to walk in.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This well situated park just beneath the West McDonnell ranges has been structured so that one gets a feel for the flora and fauna of this area. There is a very well stocked nocturnal house where one can see many of the desert animals that are not seen in daylight. A fantastic bird show takes place in a shady arena where the trainers have trained birds to follow instructions. Truly amazing to watch wild animals obey. Interesting talk by an Aboriginal guide about kinship rules and the Aboriginal map of Australia. Need water, hat, sunscreen and camera. # hours well spent."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is the place to experience and learn about the central Australian flora and fauna. The West MacDonnell ranges provide a breathtaking backdrop too! We spent nearly three hours walking around to take it all in, so plan plenty of time for this visit if you want to make the most of it - also you need sun protection and drinking water. It is well worth the visit as it is a truly unique attraction and you learn a lot."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Good and comprehensive exposure to central Australian wildlife. Need at least 3-4 hours for a good exposure. We paid around $32 per adult and the night exposure costs around $45 or $35 as combination ticket. Open 7h30, last entry 4h40 pm and closes 6pm. All day shows and talks. Bird show at 10 am and 3h30. Cinema show on the hour for 20 minutes and the highlight is certainly the last 60 seconds. Cafe with cakes and light meals. The night experience starts 7h15 pm for 90 minutes and you’ll encounter 7 nights species of which 2 are extremely rare. Coffee and cake included in price with good tour guides. Do take some warm clothing."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Do not miss the movie. I think it plays on the hour, every hour. The ending WILL surprise and I have never seen anything quite like it. Bird show is a must see also. Nocturnal house great. We spent 3 hours easily. Highly recommend"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Get there on opening time and watch the movie and bird show ,then wander around the park see birds in walk in aviaries and lot more Australian animals. They have talks at diffrent time a round the park and it is well worth hearing them a great day out for every one . Easy walk but you can hire a scooter for $10 a day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a fabulous park with so much to see and do. Our guide Matt was very knowledgable with all areas of the park. You need to be there early to make the most of the park. The three areas desert rivers woodland and sand landscape each have a different attractions to look at. The shows are worth scheduling into your time there. The dingo talk and display with there handlers is great. The bird show was my favourite so much so that we then did the eagle encounter. The nocturnal house is also a must. Take the day to relax and enjoy with your family.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Visited this wonderful park today fascinating in all aspects had a wonderful talk by Doug on the original tribe in the area was so knowledgeable had the crowd mesmerised even small children were not bored.....not to be missed if visiting Alice Springs
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We spent a very pleasant day at the park. We particularly enjoyed the educational side of it as the staff were only too happy to stop and talk about the exhibits and the displays. The nocturnal section was the best I have every seen anywhere in Australia.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,#We enjoyed the visit don’t miss going and seeing the park it a great day out.. I really enjoyed the Bush Medicean session and Bird sessions with the Owls it was the best !!!! Hess our guide was very informative and friendly with lots of interesting stories to share
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Easily spend a day here. So much to see and learn. All the staff are inspiring in their knowledge and love of this place.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We really enjoyed our day at the Park - beautifully laid out paths with excellently kept ‘gardens’. There were frequent and clean amenities around the park and bubblers also which is a brilliant idea!! We went to as many of the sessions as we could and every presenter we saw was articulate, pleasant and beyond knowledgeable. Jeremy and Skip were especially engaging and I could have listened to both of them all day!! The bird aviary were especially enjoyable for me xx So many gorgeous Australian birds - look and sounds spectacular!!!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were taken to the Alice Springs Desert Park as part of the Trek Larapinta end to end walk, so I had no expectations. We had a great afternoon watching the free flight bird show, listening to Jeremy give a talk about plant medicine (very informative and funny) and visiting the nocturnal house. It was well worth it, and if you have the time, I’d spend the day there, there is plenty more to do."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The park which is close to town is a great place to visit. The talks which are held throughout the day were very informative and hel you learn about the native animals and aboriginal culture Get there early as it can be warm
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We loved the nocturnal house and we spent ages watching the thorny devils. Don’t miss the cultural talk - it was really interesting and the kids enjoyed getting a close look and feel as we passed around all the objects (including seeds, bowls, weapons)"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's still the best place to get a taste of the diverse environments and wildlife of the red centre. Love the bird show, the walk-through aviaries and the nocturnal house, as well as the pleasure of wandering at the foot of the range. The nocturnal house lecture was too crowded so we left, but we'd already spent quite some time in there earlier so it didn't matter."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"For sure, this desert park is more than ""a park in the desert"" with big enclosures for birds (some can be gone in & some just to look through the glass), a building for nocturnal animals (with big display cases inside), feeding shows (in the areas of the kangaroos & dingoes) & a bird show (at an amphitheater area); but if there were one word to describe this place, it would be the word ""scanty"" - not many birds at all inside the enclosures, nocturnal display cases where you can ""hardly"" see any creature and where in fact the whole interior of the building is ""too dark"" to see much at all (not sure if that's just the way it's supposed to be being a place for nocturnal animals, and yes the display cases themselves are ""pretty creative""), and my ""biggest disappointment"" being the bird show at the amphitheater area where the show consisted of ""exactly one"" bird which was a small one about the size of a parrot; the feeding shows though are something I can't comment on since I missed them all arriving at about 1 30 pm (I believe all their feeding shows take place ""fairly early"" in the morning), but I kind of doubt there are that many animals to feed here for those feeding shows to be worthwhile (I went over to the kangaroo area and saw just three kangaroos which is nothing comparable to the ""impressive number"" I saw later at Lone Pine Sanctuary in Brisbane although yes the three I saw here are like ""twice the size"" of those at Lone Pine). But yes, apart from being pretty average at its live displays (as mentioned above), this place I would say is pretty great at ""educational"" displays (there's a lot you can learn about the Australian Outback & how the aboriginal people lived in the desert for centuries from the big info displays all over the park grounds), and also there are info sessions (for desert herbs & such) & a documentary show at the cinema room inside the main building. Coming by public transportation, there's a bus you can take from the stop across the street from the Post Office in the CBD, but the driver put up the 'Out Of Service' sign at 12 noon (not sure if that's usually the case in this city which is actually just a small town), so I ended up walking for about an hour & a half along Larapinta Drive (heading west from the CBD), but the walk was actually ""not bad"" going past the ""neat & pleasant"" suburbs on the outskirt of town (even if you take the bus, you'll still have to walk about 15 minutes from where you get off which is the stop on Larapinta at Albrecht Drive). In any case, considering the cost of 30-something dollars for this place, it is actually ""more worthwhile"" in my opinion to visit Olive Pink Botanic Garden (all the way to the east from here on the opposite side of town) where you can also have a ""nice feel"" of the desert similar to here (just minus animals & info displays) and for ""absolutely no cost""."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This off Ghan excursion to ASDP was truly wonderful from front row seats at free flight bird show to awesome cultural talk and show in theatre with local indigenous guides. Flora and fauna galore with great views of Macdonnell ranges. Nocturnal house is also a must see.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We'd heard good things about the Desert Park so caught a taxi out from our hotel (about $20 for the 8km). We made sure we timed the visit for the morning free flight demo. The place was very quiet. There was quite a lot of birdlife in the shrubs around the entrance, but they were hard to see clearly (could hear them though). We had enough time so had a coffee in the cafe before walking around past the dingo talk and the gathering point for the emu talk (not strongly interested in those - have seen enough of them). The free flight exhibition was very good. There was a tawny frogmouth snoozing in the covered seating area (and pretending to be a stick when the big raptors were about) - I gather it is a resident. The barn owl was great, the wedge tail eagle was better. Apart from the ""trained"" raptors, several local opportunists were also trying to get in on the act for a free feed. A great show. We then spent a couple of hours wandering around the paths and visiting the various aviaries - some were walk in aviaries. At one, there was a local raptor sitting on top of the aviary, practically salivating over the variety of birds below it. We were able to see at fairly close range a number of the birds we'd heard but not seen well before. We had a light lunch in the cafe before asking the park staff to call a taxi to take us back into Alice Springs - we only had to wait about 5 minutes in the covered bus shelter. I gather the place is serviced by an infrequent local bus, but didn't research that further. We were quite impressed by the visit. Make sure you have a hat & water - it is quite exposed & gets hot."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was an excellent visit while in Alice Springs. The family loved the wildlife - including dingos, emus, kangroos, and many excellent bird enclosures. Highlights would be the noctural display and the bird show. There were a couple tour buses there at opening, yet we still felt like we had the park to ourselves. Suggestion: save the movie for later in the morning (the tour buses started there), and enjoy the dingos, kangaroos, and emus first thing."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very nicely done this one. Sort of a jotsnic garden with a wide range of animals. If you want to see all the animals Australia has to offer then this is your stop. Make sure to get to the birdshow...it is really amazing!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you want to experience a taste of the outback this is the place to visit . There is something for every one , great place for kids to learn about the traditional owners culture and customs. Lots of bird life to see and the Nocturnal house tour is a must. They have a kids play area, coffee shop , gift shop and theater."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert park is the best way to get a sense of the scale and variety of the landscapes, flora and fauna. Each of the ""desert"" habitats you may encounter on your travels, are represented, and 2 highlights are the Nocturnal house, and the Raptor display. Check the times for this- one in the morning and one in the afternoon. We did the 10AM morning session, after walking through the habitat displays for about 1,5-2 hours- again don't rush as there is so much information. Sit also in the front rows for best photo opportuntiies."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was our favourite place to visit in Alice Springs but we only had 4 hours there and it wasn't enough time. You can either wander around and self explore or join in on particular talks/tours.The Nocturnal house is one of the best I have ever seen and we were also able to go into Kangaroo and bird enclosures. The free flying bird show was amazing and the Aboriginal talk on Bush Tucker and the tools that they used to hunt and gather was very educational and professional. One of the highlights for us was an encounter with two dingoes which were being walked on leads by their keepers. My granddaughter was able to pat one. Unforgettable day for us both.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"From start to finish, we enjoyed every minute. Allow at least 4 hours for your visit & make sure you take in the free flight bird show which was fabulous, the dingo talk, and all the other talks you can manage to fit in. The gardens were spectacular and the staff really need applauding for their work. Fabulous place to visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A 3km round walk, but worth every minute of it. You get to go in and sit with the birds on many occasions, at certain times of the day, there is an Eagle feeding show, well worth the experience, but the NOCTURNAL centre, was my favourite, looking at all the the animals of the night... Make sure you visit this park"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"While visiting Alice Springs with some Aussie friends, we stopped at the Alice Springs Desert Park for an afternoon visit. What a wonderful experience! The park is lovely with nice walking paths through different desert environments. There are also enclosed Aviaries along the way with different native birds in natural settings, but the best parts of the visit were the Ranger programs included in the price of admission. (Don't let reviews tell you that it is too expensive, you get what you pay for.) Don't miss the Bird Show, it was spectacular. Various raptors circle over your head or pop out from behind logs as if on cue. Some wild native Kites even got into the act! We are pretty knowledgable birders, but we learned a lot about native birds from the presentation. Another highlight was the Aboriginal genealogy presentation. Doug gave a great explanation of Aboriginal laws that govern marriage and family relationships. We learned about the historical importance of 'skin names' in protecting these isolated communities from inter-breeding. The small animal enclosures were OK, like a small local zoo that you might find just about anywhere. We did not do the nocturnal tour, but that might be fun if you have the time. It is important to plan your visit. The presentations only occur at certain times and some, like the Bird Show, are closed if you arrive late."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Entry cost was rather steep ($32pp) but we felt it was worth it- plenty to see and informative across the displays/areas. Outlines the different desert types and the flora and fauna in each. Of particular interest was the nocturnal display- although make sure there is a guide around to point out the animals or you will spend considerable time (like we did) trying to find them in the dark!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were impressed by the variety of birds animals and a few reptiles that are generally found in the desert areas near Alice Springs. The bird show was very good and the night walk really enjoyable. Loved watching the Echidna and Bettong in their native habitat. The Aviaries were very good also, show desert birds that could easily be seen out in the bush."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Far better than I expected. Talks and displays very educational. Great environment to wander around and spend a few hours in
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This place was recommended by a friend and we weren't disappointed. All of the exibits and animal shows were top class & Doug explaining his culture and history was excellent.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A day was spent at this wonderful place following the tours around. We found them very educational and learnt a lot about the animals around this area. The survival in the desert and bush medicine talks were great and every staff member we came across were polite and friendly and happy to answer any questions. The only complaint was the cafe was lacking in a variety of food no vegetarian options and not much choice of food at all. Would definitely come back and would recommend a visit . Loved it
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"At first it seems a bit expensive, but the exhibit areas are very well done and give a good understanding of what you see in the area. We spent 4 hours during the day, then came back for the evening tour on a dual ticket. The dual ticket has a 3 day window on booking the night tour The aviaries are excellent, pause in them until the noisy walk throughs have gone and you will be rewarded with birds coming very close. There is a great aquarium with fish found in the Finke River, and a close look at a Parentie, as well as pens with emu, red Roos and dingos. Presentations and activities started from 8.30 and the park was open from 7.30. Good keeper talks blending natural history and local tradition. Free flight presentation with birds was well done.. even the wild kites performed well.. The nocturnal house is large and well presented. Dont miss the Thorny devils eating ants.. Extensive supplementary plantings help with understanding the plant life, so it is equally a botanic park. We also did the nocturnal tour. This is in a separate fenced area, you walk through by red torch light while the keeper puts out supplementary food and talks about the many animals living there. We saw plenty of mala wallabies, brush tailed bettongs, and golden bandicoots. They come right up to you as long as you arent loud and noisy. It's not rushed. Also saw echidna and stick nest rats although the Bilby was a no show, but there were plenty of encounters and lots of info. After the walk, tea coffee and cake, and a chance to ask any more questions. Good coffee and friendly service at the on site cafe."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My family and I came to the Desert Park and really had a blast. Love being able to go into the kangaroo enclosure. And the bird show was definitely a highlight as well. Highly recommend. Only thing I would skip is the movie. It was boring.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I arrived late morning spent time walking through the various sections of the park then listened to the 'Survival in the Desert' presentation. Because I was issued with a wristband when I paid to enter the park, I was able to leave the park to explore elsewhere then come back to the park to see the 'Flying Bird Show. There were presentations & activities that I didn't have time to experience."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is definitely a half or whole day activity - there are lots of talks and shows throughout the day as well as lots of unusual birds and animals to see. We loved the nocturnal house and the Roos - if you look carefully you will see the joey in its mums pouch! We arrived late (at 3.30pm) on our first visit, but for just $5 we were about to pop back a few days later to see the things we missed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We enjoyed the bird show, very entertaining and lots of different birds showcased flying around. Make sure you check the times of the bird show and plan your day around it so you don’t miss it. You will probably spend 3 hours at the desert park. There are enclosures with dingoes, emus, kangaroos, perentie, bustard, a good nocturnal house and then lots of bird enclosures to walk through. My kids were not that interested in all the birds. The movie is quite good, we didn’t catch it this time as it is only shown on the hour, every hour. But check it out if you are there at the right time. Older people may enjoy the wildflowers that are planted around. July is a good time to see them as they were just starting to bloom when we were there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It was lovely to have a walk around in a bush like setting with path. There was minimal animals to see and not much to do apart from read information sings, which would not take long! I was excited to see a bilby for the first time! Although only one..."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We got there early and were able to listen to most of the talks, which were very informative and given by friendly, knowledgeable people. Fun way to learn about some of the wildlife of the area and the indigenous culture."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"And absolutely amazing and wonderful place to visit, especially the how. To survive in the outback taught from the aboriginal guide Jeremy he spoke about their heritage culture ways of life and kept all the visitors interested during his very informative and instructive knowledge of the outback, and he’s aboriginal culture a must to see"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Ok, second time. Amazing both times. Though this time I got to do the night tour. How cool is this. wow. You should do both. They are different areas. the night tour was specifically built a decade ago for this. If you have an evening, do THIS. Stop being silly."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"In visiting the park we were a bit reserved, being from country Australia. We were pleasantly surprised, the bird show was fantastic, all the talks we attended we informative and we learnt something at every talk. Tips : attend as many of the talks as possible. These are great. Jeremy was fantastic, great sense of humour and very knowledgeable about his culture. The nocturnal centre was really well set out. Really interesting. Improvments needed : the Cafe was a let down, sandwiches and coffee main food on offer. The talks were sometimes a little big, the nocturnal one had too many people in it. A suggestion would be to run 3 per day in busy season."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited as a family got there just in time for the bird experience show which was the highlight of the day. We then slowly walked throughout all the other displays and absorbed all the beautiful desert animals that are unique to the area. Highly recommend the visit.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Thoroughly enjoyed our day out here. The flying bird show was fantastic but my highlight was the “survival in the desert” presentation with Doug. I learnt so much and have a greater appreciation of the way of the indigenous people. Thank you to the Arrante people for allowing this fantastic park to be built for everyone to learn about birds, trees, plants, animals and the McDonnell ranges."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We raced to the park excited for the bird show arriving 15 before only to be turned away and told to come back for the 3.30 show. We went round the park and enjoyed the talk by Doug about Aboriginal culture- so passionate! We then tried to kill time by having lunch at the cafe. Big thumbs down 👎. Stale sandwiches, no hot food and limited selection even though park was very busy. Finally lined up and waited for 30 min for bird show(our main reason for going to the park) One magpie, a curlew and a brief glimpse of a buzzard who then went wayward, the show ended abruptly and we had to leave. How can the park have such a good reputation but employ incompetent people ( except for Doug) couldn’t get our money back. When you travel from other side of Australia you can’t just come back on a better day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The desert park is worth a visit - very large & well set out. Fantastic nocturnal area & a wonderful bird show were the highlights for us. Cost about $32 for entry but easily spend half a day there. There is also a cafe onsite & a theatre area
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,WE really enjoyed our visit to this gem of a spot fantastic views of the Mountains and really friendly and knowlegablle staff.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The park is fabulous and well worth the visit. Set aside a full day. The cafe however is rubbish. Plan to bring your own food or go off site.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A beautiful place and silent location to hear the wildlife. Loved the knowledge shared by enthusiastic staff. Fantastic signage on the exhibits with the important message of getting rid of feral animals and making sanctuaries safe to maintain our wildlife. Best place to visit in Alice Springs. The vegetation and flowers were superb.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Beautifully landscaped park showcasing Australia's desert flora and fauna with interesting and entertaining presentations on wildlife, traditional artefacts and cultural practices. The birds of prey presentation and the nocturnal house were particularly good. A must see for any family spending time in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent five hours during the day here. Great stuff! The bird show and aboriginal talk were both great. Didn't love the movie - too artsy and not enough content. The animals are great. Yes, they are mostly birds - but they are so different than birds on other continents that it's worth the time. The night tour was great - walking with a group of 15 searching for Mala, bilby, and bandicoots. I'd suggest doing both. Do know that a taxi is about 20-25 dollars each direction."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were last at the park 5 years ago and returned because we had such a great time then. The park is just as good today. We meandered through the whole park, enjoying birds and plants, caught a couple of the many guide talks on offer and were once again impressed with the bird show. This is a beautiful park well worth devoting at least 1/2 a day if not more. The space easily disperses visitors and it is not until the bird show or a popular talk that you realise just how many others are also there. The bird that loves blond hair for his nest has diversified to light coloured sweater fluff which is just as well since this time our blond kids were not with us!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A must see when you go there. So much to see. Love watching the bird show and the cheeky little wagtail bird. He wants to be the star of the show.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went to mostly see the bird show and I feel that was the highlight of the park. It’s not a zoo so don’t expect animals left right and centre. We saw Dingos, an emu and some kangaroo. The nocturnal house was great too. One of my sons who is 8 said he was bored at one stage but he enjoy the bird show so that was good. Amenities were clean, staff friendly and informative."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We stayed 4 nights in Alice Springs and visited the Desert Park without much enthusiasm - just because we had nothing better to do. The park was a fantastic surprise with generous enclosures for the local wildlife as well as the birds. We were lucky enough to be able to patt Dingo`s which were walked on a leach by there ""guardians"". The absolute highlight however was the nocturnal house! Never seen such a animal friendly end generous nocturnal compound before! I the end we stayed there for some 4 hours and could have returned the next day! This was worth every penny!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,AMAZING ... would highly recommend this place. We spent hours here looking and reading about the local animals and plants that the aboriginals used in medicines and for other purposes. Unfortunately the day that we were there the wedge tail eagle didn't make an appearance and for good reason .. the local wedge tail eagles are currently mating and would attack the parks eagle. This is a shame as it would have been fantastic but hats off to the park for not allowing this to happen to their eagle. Jeremy ... wow full of information. To be honest talking to Jeremy was the highlight of my time here - he is full of information and an absolute asset to the park (my point of view). Unfortunately the café was a little bit of a let down but aside from that this is ONE MUST DO TRIP when visiting Alice.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Desert park was a great place to walk around! It was a chilly wind but the landscape & wildlife were great to see. We did the bird show which really amazing! How do they train them to fly in??? Loads of space for kids & groups. I wish we booked the nocturnal or breakfast tours. Only downside was the cafe must have had new staff getting training so coffee wasn’t very nice and service was poor. A lot of staff just standing around - weird layout?? To line up and pay?
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We only had a couple of hours to visit the Alice Springs Desert Park and could have stayed for hours longer. It is not cheap, but it is a fabulous place & we felt it was great value, even for the short time we spent. We went at 9.30am, and saw the Flying Birds show - I won’t spoil it by giving away the secrets, but it’s amazingly good. The birds are spectacular - completely free-range and at times almost within touching distance. The aviaries enable you to see and hear a huge number of indigenous birds at close range - even outside the aviaries there seem to be flocks of finches and other birds attracted by the predator free environment. My daughter loved the dingos out lazing around, and the nocturnal exhibit is excellent. Don’t expect to see all the animals - we saw about 85%, including rare & extremely cute native marsupials. The place feels modern, well-kept, and in tune with the local environment and culture. Worth the short drive out of Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was an amazing experience. The keeper talks are great, particularly when the aboriginal culture is combined into the presentations. The prey bird show is fantastic. The nocturnal tour is mind blowing! Well done."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Visited during the day was amazing. We also did the nocturnal tour it was truly great. We were led amongst the animals and got to see Mala, echidna, bilby and others up close just terrific"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had a ball today at Desert Park. The tour guides were great at communicating and being funny AND interesting. There were lots of animals to see. Parente was asleep but the nocturnal house was brilliant with bettongs and mala (small wallaby things). And loads more.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Unfortunately, we didn't see much wildlife in our travels through the Outback. So, a visit to this park was a nice way to view the flora and fauna. Very nice presentation on the trees and plants that are native to different environments (woods, dunes, etc.) Chance to walk among some kangaroos, and loved the aviaries. The birds of prey show is amazing."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park offered both animals and flora in several different biospheres. For a fee you can walk around the outdoor areas and look at animal enclosures and learn about the plants that grow in the area. At different hours there are “talks” and the cinema offers an overview of the geology. This attraction is great for kids (2K of trails), and is well run (with a cafe). Traveling with two older adults, they both loved it. I have been to similar attractions and expected to see more animals. Lots of bird enclosures, a great nocturnal enclosure with local animals and both a dingo enclosure and kangaroo enclosure, but I expected to see more. Lots of walking, not enough animals for me."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a great day at the Alice Springs Desert Park with our 3 children. From the Nocturnal house tour, self guided walks to the bird show we had a good time & would recommend to any family."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Went here for a half day and left after a short period of time. The only reasonable thing to see here was the bird show. Very disappointing. The entry price is extremely expensive. Its very small on the animal front. Why you would have 1 emu on its own and a few others on there own is beyond me. asked the ranger and really didn't have an answer He was lonely he told us which makes it even more of a mystery.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Really well designed, lots of local species to see, great nocturnal animals display & the birds of prey demonstration is fantastic!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spent an afternoon wandering around the park and learning a lot about the desert environment. The bird show in the afternoon was very worthwhile and well presented. The staff were exceedingly helpful and the one we spent some time talking to was very knowledgeable. Thanks for a great afternoon. A bit pricey but what isn't around Alice? Thanks
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I decided on the nocturnal tour after reading great reviews and because I know there's a decent chance of echidna sightings! Sadly no echidna, but I saw two endangered bilbies and 5 other species too, which were all fascinating. My guides really made the trip stand out though; I was lucky to be the only visitor and they made sure it was an informative and fun experience. This tour is ""MUST DO""!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Your park is very well presented and loved your nocturnal house. It was all topped off by the bird show in the afternoon
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is a wonderful way to spend a day for people of all ages. Great displays, free flight shows, fabulous nocturnal house. But take your own lunch - the offerings from the café were average at best."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park was awesome. It is fairly expensive, but is an all day ticket and you can come and go.......wish we get there earlier, missed a lot of talks we would have enjoyed. Make sure you don't miss the free flight show, it was incredible"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What a great place. First thought was that we could whip round in an hour. 3hrs later we were still there. The exhibits are fabulous & informative. The talk given by Doug was outstanding. He was very happy to answer all questions & his knowledge was amazing. Learnt so much. It is a must see.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We did this as part of the Gahn trip. It was an excellent experience to see the natural environment of Alice Springs, with wild life. The guide was excellent, and the highlight was the bird show."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Allow a full day for this park, there is so much to see! The park is similar to the Healesville sanctuary. There are huge aviaries you can walk into and get up close to a vast range of birds. The nocturnal building is really well done with spiders, lizards, snakes, possums etc. You can buy lunch in the cafeteria at the reception."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very well thought out park, interesting & well maintained. Staff very friendly a couple of hours exploring the fauna & animals"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Friendly informative staff. Wonderful facility. Make sure you watch the film running in the cinema. Would like to do the night tour if I am ever in the Alice again.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent the day at the park recently and also did the meet the eagle experience. It was great to get close to Rory BUT the one thing that should be done is the photographer (Jeremey in our case) Should tell people when he is taking the photos. You only get 10 photos and you don't know where or when to look, or to smile or not. With only 10 there are a fair few where you look like a gumby. Talking or not looking etc."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited here a few years ago and loved it. This time was no different. The park explains the desert so well, showing the different regions and the birds/animals that live in them. The bird show is a definite must see. We paid extra for an up close and personal experience with a Wedge Tail Eagle....again, well worth it. If you are visiting the Red Centre, make this one of your first stops."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was quite disappointed with this exhibit. At over $25 I expected many more displays and information. The animal enclosures do not make for easy viewing and in many cases no animals were to be seen. The nocturnal house is a highlight in an otherwise underwhelming attraction. Given the money spent, it is a shame. Perhaps they need to visit some other more successful similar attractions"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We took a taxi here from our hotel in Alice Springs and thoroughly enjoyed the few hours we spent here. The employees are personable and knowledgeable, the exhibits are well-maintained, and we learned a lot about nocturnal animals, etc. The fly-over was great!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great location to walk around see lots of different animals including the elusive and awesome platypus. Attended a bird show and saw one of two kinds of birds in the world who uses a rock to crack open an egg (emu in this case). It was extraordinary to see.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited this place while staying in Alice Springs. We enjoyed it very much. Gave us lots of information and we stayed for approx 2 hours. Good value.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert park is lovely as always, staff was very friendly and helpful. Attended the park for a wedding and just had the most beautiful scenery views and lovely photo opportunity and just all around stunning. Will visit the park on my next trip back to Alice springs"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A good place to take the family for a morning or afternoon entertainment, early morning start probably the best. Learnt lots of interesting information about Dingoes and the bird show is excellent. Good to wonder the paths and have easy access to everything . A cup of coffee at the cafe finished the morning off."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had a fantastic time here will definitely be back. Very educational as well as fun. Recommend the bird show.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Enjoyed many hours out here today. Started with the bird show which was excellent. The wild birds are fascinating and you really get an appreciation of how they live in the wild. The highlight of the day for us was the Survival in the Desert presented by Jeremy. He was fantastic and really gave everyone an understanding of Aboriginal culture including the different tribes and languages, the hunting and gathering, what the bush offers, the tools and how they were made and used, the tastes of the bush and also Aboriginal law. Jeremy is passionate and sincere about his culture and it showed today. The park also hosts many other exhibits including birds, dingoes, kangaroos and an extensive nocturnal house which is brilliant. There is also a theatre showing a documentary on the history of the land and a nice cafe. The park is very well priced, I would put aside at least 4 to 6 hours to enjoy what’s on offer. I disagree with some other comments relating to the entrance price. I think it’s very good value for money."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"At the desert park, one walks along a groomed trail and can learn the names of the plants that grow in the desert, but one can also visit buildings/aviaries along the way to see the various kinds of wildlife that call the outback home. Included are posters that tell about the habits of these animals. Be prepared to spend time here getting to know what may be difficult to find in the wild."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A park not to be missed, we had a fabulous day there. A must is the movie at the end, but stay till the end for the surprise."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"May 2018 - Had the Desert Park recommended to us. Went expecting to be there for a while but ended up spending all day. For the disabled they have electric scooters for hire - $10 per day. Excellent facility. There are two free flight bird shows staring our excellent native birds, plus an Aboriginal Survival talk - excellently presented by Jeremy. There is a great Nocturnal House showing many of our native animals at ""night"". Plenty of averies to visit and other Australian wildlife to enjoy. Great for all ages. Would certainly recommend a visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a limited time in Alice Springs and chose the Desert Park to visit so we could see a snap shot of animals, birds, reptiles and the local landscape all in the one place. I would say allow 3 or 4 hours to visit as there is a lot to see and quite a bit of walking to get around. On the negative side was the cafe. It was fairly awful. The food offering was well below average. Little to choose from, not presented well and no healthy choices. The staff appeared not to really know what they were doing and had no idea how to make coffee. I know we weren't there for the food, but we needed to eat and it was in the middle of our visit. The cafe needs to lift it's game. Comparatively, we visited the Berry Springs Wildlife Park near Darwin a few days later and could only rave about the food and service. Fresh and delicious."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We spent the whole day here and would go again if visiting Alice Springs. Such a wide variety of things to see with the highlights being presentations on bush food and medicines.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I just thought that paying $32 was way overpriced considering Melbourne Zoo costs $36. But i did love the Nocturnal Animals hut, that was so cool, would have spent more time there but as I was running short of time, couldn't stay long. The park is wide and and open was an enjoyable walk around."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Outdoor natural area about 10-15 minutes outside of Alice. So many varsities of animals and birds - some we have never even heard of. Wonderful. The paths allow you to get close to birds and kangaroos and other marsupials. Self-guided but rangers were very helpful and willing to guide as time allows. Usually HOT so go early in the day if the heat bothers you. Well worth the entrance fee. Not crowded when we were there in January. Quite a large park with a bit of walking. Not a zoo, a natural Australian wildlife park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This place was great for kids and anyone who is interested in Australian animals and plants. The bird show is a must see. But don’t be late or u won’t get into it. Take lunch and explore the whole park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a wonderful afternoon at this venue. Erin and the bird show were incredible and rates as one of my favourite experiences! If you are considering going I have two suggestions - firstly, do it! And secondly, plan a day there...the bird show in the morning and afternoon and fill in between with the wonderful aviaries, the nocturnal house, lunch and walks. Well worth the entry price!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent nearly a full day there watching the bird display, learning about indigenous culture and observing the animals that live in central Australia."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The bird show was terrific. The rest of the park is a great introduction to the desert. I saw the eagle show which is worth it
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Love the education shows and nocturnal area. The bird show is a must see. Cafe food not bad but only bought small things. Great staff and lots to see.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Desert Springs is a must see and do. My favourite activity is the bird show, make sure you're there on time 9.30 amfor a 10 am start. I don't want to tell you too much or it will spoil the surprises but it's a must see/do. So too is the nocturnal house, which gives you opportunity to see Australia's nocturnal wildlife. The paths are wide and suitable for walking aides."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert park is a fantastic place to visit when in Alice Springs. Full of local fauna and flora, it showcases our local environment. The nocturnal house is favourite of my daughter and also where you can walk among the kangaroos. Its a bit of a walk for little or tired feet so just be aware of the distance of the walking tracks before you visit. I cant comment on the current cafe as I'm yet to visit it. Bring water, hat, sunscreen and a fly net if you're visiting during the current fly plague."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Well worth the time to visit. Well laid out. Good selection of wildlife. Aviaries and a huge nocturnal house makes this place very interesting. Hook explanation of the surrounding landscapes as well.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,If you would like to get up close to incredible Australian nocturnal animals (some of them now extinct in the wild) then a night walk is a must. They can also do with your support in conservation efforts to safegaurd and breed species that are very endangered. We loved every minute of this unique experience. Echidna sniffing at your feet is something you will never forget.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A must see while here in Alice. Admission prices vary for families groups seniors etc. I thought reasonably priced as you can spend hours here. The highlights Nocturnal House, Aviaries, Fauna gardens. Wildlife tend not to be active when hot. There are numerous toilets, shelters, shade spread throughout. Cafe on site. The pathways & information were 10/10. We loved it! Yes we would recommend & try to do the Nocturnal Tour at night next time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,You go to Alice Springs to get to Ayres Rock. But the town and Desert Park are very different and inviting. Ut's a cross between driving through West Texas and Mars. You get this eerie feeling of being watched. But we went to Alice Springs to see something different and something few travelers get to see. And wow...Alice Springs is different and marvelous all in one.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Alice Springs Desert Park is fantastic. About 23 km from of the township. Lots of history here and the vegetation is amazing. The sky at nighttime offers a million dollar view to the Milky Way. A must visit when in Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Enjoyed the experience of Australian alligator activity programme. Kids love the place. Good place to teach the kids.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great narration by the keepers on the animals that are on display. Bird of prey show is very good with a good range of birds and an interactive display. Well maintained and clean and tidy, rest rooms very clean. A bit pricey and dissapointed that they did not have a gift shop."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited from out of state. This is a fabulous park, friendly knowledgeable guides, great layout and fabulous animals. Don’t miss the bird show, it’s fabulous. There are cold water stations along the paths, perfect on hot days."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Go do it if you have the time. Up close and personal with the animals that come out at night. No enclosures or cages. Real ‘wild’ life.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were told visiting the park was a must do while we were in Alice Springs and it did not disappoint! The displays are great and the bird show was fantastic! The kids loved the cheeky Willy Wagtail and the Curlew that walked amongst the crowd :) the day we visited was very hot and windy so I’d recommend plenty of sunscreen, hats and lots of water. Be prepared for lots of walking!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Why did the person in the reception automatically assume that the men in our party would pay and gave maps only to the men and completely ignored the women as she gave information as if we were some kind of stupid creatures? It really surprises me how people like that can be in the service industry. Please train your staff better, this kind of treatment/aggression is unacceptable!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is an absolute must see attraction. The Bird Show is brilliant, not only entertaining also factual and interesting. The walk through cages allow you to get close to many birds and animals. You can easily spend an entire day here and probably want to come back again. Take a hat, comfortable shoes and loose clothes. One of the best attractions I have been to."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"They have done a great job with this establishment..very clean and interesting displays, not your average tourist attraction!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The desert park is a must see while in alice springs. Regular talks by the knowledgeable staff and plenty to see and do. Lots of native species and you can see it at your own pace. Jeremy our aboriginal guide was generous with his time and taught us so much about the history of the people and traditions.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Spent all day here as there is so much to see and do. Don’t rush around give yourself time to look and enjoy. The staff are friendly and helpful. The free flight bird show is a must, I did both. The walk through Aviary’s are great for birdwatching or just sitting and soaking up the environment. The Nocturnal House is huge with over 30 different species including the Bilby. The information boards and illustrations are very helpful."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a great place to roam for a couple of hours! Good exhibits, and info around the park is great. We stopped for a coffee after which we won't do again as it was terrible. The nocturnal house is phenomenal. Worth the visit just for that."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Desert Park is set across three different desert environments with easy walks between each. Informative guided walks are on offer at times across the day and the bird show is not to be missed. Make sure you have your hats and sunscreen though!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,If you can pop over and book in the night tour as is it a really cool experience and you get to see animals you probably never will in the wild!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We loved this place though highly recommend going early in the day. It gets HOT. We added the noctural tour and came back that evening, which was very special. I think we got the training crew though - eager but not the most informed. Our guide had never heard of the Galapagos."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Just arrived in Alice Springs and followed a local couple’s advice on their blog to go and visit the Desert Park first thing. Spend nearly three hours there, but could easily had been there longer. Don’t miss the bird show!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We thought that this would be a simple nature reserve or scenic viewing point. We were suprised to find an extremely professional park. We stayed about 4 hours.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is a really incredible spot. Get there are early as you can to beat the heat and MAKE SURE you hit the 10 am free-flying bird show - it's a must see. The staff was very helpful, and they are very concerned with visitors' safety in the intense heat. Don't forget your hat and sunscreen, and a big water bottle. I brought a one litre bottle and filled it about five times. My only gripe with the park is that it's very difficult to get there if you don't have a car. I managed to hitch a ride up there, and the website led me to believe a bus could take me back, but there was no bus, and I ended up having to take a pricey taxi back into Alice Springs. Overall, this is a great day in the Outback, but make sure you plan out your trip!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Definitely slip, slip, slap if you go to park and the earlier the better. Easy walking, well located water stations. Can walk through some animal enclosures. Staff nice & knowledgeable"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This tour was so worth while - so many endangered creatures all in one place without fences between you and them. We saw Mala, Bilbies, Bettongs just to name a few. The staff were friendly and very knowledgeable. There were refreshments as well. All in all I would highly recommend this tour."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Alice Springs Desert Park is a really well designed and managed attraction playing its role in wildlife protection and conservation. It is split into 3 different zones showcasing the various different desert environments found in this part of the world. It is home to a great diversity of different large animals, birds , reptiles and insects some of whom are greatly endangered or already extinct in the wild. Staff are very knowledgeable and approachable to share their knowledge. The park itself is well designed given the summer climate with many shaded seating areas and cold water fountains as well as a pleasant cafe. The walking tracks are easy on the feet and provide some short-cut options for those who may need them. It is a little too far to walk from the centre of town but options to travel there by car or bus are easy to arrange. Overall probably the number one thing to put on your ‘To Do’ list when visiting for the first time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What a great little park was so happy i got to hold my favourite bird an owl beautiful park friendly staff great place for young and old
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Not a zoo and not a theme park, but an excellent insight of the real life in a ""lifeless"" desert. Good selection of information boards describing the geography and animals. Plenty of shady stops and water stops. Interactive talks throughout the day are well worth it"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,great for tourists who haven't been outback but also for others who want to see those many nocturnal animals of the area. Lovely bird show!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,More than I expected. The attention to detail on creating the various areas was stunning. Loved the aviaries. I could spend 5 hours easily in here. The nocturnal hall is the biggest and best I've seen. The interpretation is very good.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A wonderful Wildlife Park full of amazing creatures fantastic plants a very informative place where you can learn so much about Alice Springs and the surrounding area
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You will probably never get to see all the spectacular wildlife that the red centre has to offer. So this is the place to visit. The live bird show was the best we have ever seen. The Nocturnal House was amazing and all the Bilbys, snakes and lizards etc. looked like they were in their natural habitat. Highly recommend you take the time to visit this park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a lovely park to visit and while was hot walking though it the displays were worth the effort and the cafe at the end friendly and inviting
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Ok they recreated the desert in the desert. Talks start early and you must be there in some cases before they start. Go they are great and very informative. Take a lot of water. They have places to drink but most are not cold water.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I would recommend a visit to the Alice Springs Dessert Park. A great place to visit during the day as well at night. They do conduct nocturnal tours to watch the animals.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,If you’re visiting central Australia then this is a must see attraction. Brilliant presentations of local dessert flora & fauna. The live birds of prey demonstrations is the pinnacle of the experience. Don’t pass through Alice without seeing it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Super great park, highly recommend the nocturnal tour too, very good talks from staff, bird show was excellent , we originally were going for a couple of hours in the day, stayed eight hours."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Desert dwellers you have never been aware of. Plants and creatures that play a significant roll in the environment are all on display and a very knowledgable commentary by the keepers of the park add to the information that can be gained from this tour. The nocturnal house is very interesting. Discover the geology of the Mcdonnell ranges. Recommended Russell T
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"interesting place with a diverse variety of wild-flowers and plants, birds and amusing show. They care for the animals deeply. I really liked that they had walk-in enclosures and not tiny cramped cages."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"and reviewers ignore. I’d advise get there on opening, Aussie animals are too smart to keep working on into the heat. Follow the program, and get to presentations 10 minutes early. If you miss the presentations the park is about sparse as the actual desert. Our bird show, the park highlight, was curtailed because of the rain, but the magpie still got her lines right. Onya. 15 years ago the experience of seeing the kites come down from 1000 feet up was awe inspiring but I don’t know if that still happens."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park was a little bit different. It has spacious animal pens scattered about the property containing native species. They have a very entertaining birds of prey show where the animals fl fly free. For an extra fee, you can also have your photo taken with one of the larger bird of prey. There are interesting walks past different types of native flora that interconnect the animal pens. Would love to visit it again."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had a fantastic time at the park and even had the opportunity to hold a barn owl. Would definitely recommend to others.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I advise to go early in the day to take advantage of all of the activities on offer also it is cooler. We had a small window in the afternoon of a very hot day but saw enough to know we will be back on our next visit. Even though we missed the talks and activities the park offers we still had a wonderful time the Nocturnal House being the highlight. It was so exciting to see the desert creatures of the night we would otherwise never get to see. As it was afternoon and hot all the other animals and birds were resting so I am looking forward to visiting this park early morning next time to see the birds and animals when they are up and about.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park facility is world class! Awesome displays, wildlife habitats and bird shows at regular times. The nocturnal house is phenomenal. I spent the entire day there and saw everything, did everything. The guided shows with the Aboriginal rangers were very informative and coveted topics such as bush tucker and survival methods in the bush and bush medicine. For food, the little cafe has great good options. This is a must- see facility in Alice Springs. A wonderful way to understand the flora and fauna of Central Australia and Indigenous connections to the land."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Definitely arrive at 7.30am otherwise to hot for the kids. Really a great outing. The bird show is brilliant. We paid for the night tour which was even better. Neil and Steph know their stuff and the kids freaked out on the echidna's especially the baby.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I didn’t think I would spend so long here, except there was so much interesting information about Australian history, plants and animals which I found fascinating. The rangers were exceptional and very knowledgeable. Would highly recommend!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Apart from the demonstrations this is an excellent show of central australian birds and the habitats they live in. All laid out nicely with the incredible backdrop of the rocky ranges that make this area so beautiful.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Enjoy viewing a lot of bird aviaries, a nocturnal house (one of the few indoor spaces), the bird show, and many of the guided tours that go on throughout the whole day. I saw that the Alice Wanderer bus can take you to/from the park, but the only pick up time from the hotels was at 830 or 230, and all pick up times from the park was at 430, so I ended up taking a cab both ways. It cost about $20 each way. The gift shop people at the park will call you a cab back to your accommodation if you don't want to make an international call to order a cab (since the park is a bit out of the way from traffic, you can't just go out and hail one on the streets). The park itself takes about 2.5 hours to walk and view if you don't do any of the guided tours. However, I strongly recommend the tours! The tour is actually more of a guided talk, and each tour is about 20 minutes long, and the tour guide shares a lot of knowledge on the animals or nature and you get a much better understanding of the animals or nature you're seeing. My tour guide was kangaroos and dingos was Jerry (or Gerry?). It seemed like he was filling in for someone else who normally does the tour, but I thought Jerry was fantastic! He was really knowledgable and during the kangaroo tour, he shared some extra photos to supplement the tour. Also do NOT miss the bird show that happens at 10 AM. They do NOT allow anyone to go in late because it's a free-flying bird show (the birds fly out in the open). So be sure to get to the bird show location about 10-15 minutes early and grab a seat, as seats will fill up quickly! It rained heavily the morning I showed up at the park, and it seems like the park will give out umbrellas to visitors. I had brought my own. You are out in the open most of the time, so be sure to carry an umbrella if you think it will rain the day you are going to the park. Despite the rain, I still got to enjoy all the animals and desert scenery. And if it the bird show ends up being canceled because of the rain, they will give out a voucher for you to come back another day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Don't miss spending some time at the Alice Springs Desert Park. General admission includes a beautiful birds-of-prey live presentation, lots of different environments to walk around (very informative), a special 20 minute video production (surprise ending!), nocturnal house, lovely aviaries...and all right in the middle of the ancient and spectacular Red Centre. Be sure to time your visit re: weather (heat; go early), and transport can be arranged by Emu Run...or ask your hotel/hostel. It's about a 10 minute drive outside Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Enjoyed a wonderful day exploring the desert park, especially enjoyed the many bird aviaries, the nocturnal house is also a must see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Spent a couple of hours here. They have guided tours where you learn all about the endangered species of the bush. The nocturnal house is really well done and interesting. The close encounter with the birds of prey is absolutely brilliant, you can if you wish hold one of the birds on a glove provided by the super friendly staff. The park is beautiful done out and all the animals look very well cared for. There is a cafe there and drinking water throughout the park. All in all a great place to visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spent a lovely morning here seeing all the birds and animals. Free flight show was excellent as was the film show. Good value day out for adults and children
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The time spent (a couple of hours) at this park was worthwhile. The bird show was most impressive, especially the owl who popped up in broad daylight. The nocturnal exhibit had a range of animals that we would never normally see. Make sure you take a hat, sunscreen and water when visiting."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a great spot. Book a guide if you can to get the most out of your visit. The flying bird show is fantastic and educational. An aboriginal guide can really enhance your visit, they discuss tools the used, hunting, desert life. The area is beautiful, there are many neat birds in the aviary. We even saw a black Cockatoo...The night animal house is really interesting. Highly recommend. Loved it"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Nice and close to the CBD all the different animals and ecosystems that make up the red centre. The Free Flying Bird show is a must see informative as well as entertaining. The rangers are all friendly, knowledgeable and some are from the local Arunta people - well worth the visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We have just moved to Alice so I purchased a Territorian Pass which is fantastic value! My son and I will be regular visitors to the park. The staff are very knowledgable; we listened to the kangaroo and dingo talks which were very interesting. My son loved the Nocturnal House - lots of fun! The park grounds are beautifully maintained and the backdrop of the MacDonnell Ranges is stunning - especially when used as the feature of the cinema presentation. A great place to visit, a fantastic attraction for Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Being a coastal dweller, I love spending time in the desert and I couldn't wait to visit. Given that this is also a conservation park, we weren't expecting all the bells and whistles that you usually see at the money making animal parks. I absolutely loved the Bird Show. The little Willy Wag Tail that wasn't a part of the show was such a character! The Buzzard and Barn Owl are beautiful birds along with the other birds that took part. Great to see these animals are loved and cared for in their own environment. We took our time wandering around the park and we listened to an Aboriginal Lady talk about her amazing and fascinating culture. So much that we learnt. It is very much worthwhile to take the time to listen to the park workers talk about the animals. They are really informative and passionate about the animals and the environment. I really loved visiting this park. I just hope the importance of conservation spreads and that visitors see how special these animals really are."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Don’t omit this one from your Alice Springs itinerary. I spent several hours here exploring the different landscapes / enclosures. It had rained heavily the evening before, which made for an excellent experience: the desert landscapes where authentic and picturesque, the birds and insects were in full sound, and even the smells of the warm damp desert bush land added to the whole ambiance of the day. The staff were friendly and informative, and the map guide presented to visitors at the entrance was great for planning your day, fitting in the guided talks, movie, and exhibits you want to see. Thoroughly recommend."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Take the shuttle out to visit this amazing desert park to get an overview of the natural environment in which Alice Springs was planned. Plan to spend several hours here, dropping into hear scheduled talks eg. Indigenous talk was very informative. On hot days, get there early."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It was the first park we visited in Australia and we were impressed by the variety of animals and the scenery. Particularly we liked the bird show, it was quite amazing to see all the birds around. There is also a lot of information regarding animals. You can spend there a lot of time, particularly if you go with children, but we just spent 2 hours since we had to go to another place. It was enough though."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Nice vistas and scenery - a must see - we loved it and recommend it highly to travelers - great stop
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was the fourth visit to Desert Park and it is always worthwhile. It was a hot 38 degree day, and some activities were cancelled. The pick of them - the wild bird show - was still scheduled and did not fail to impress. Each time we have seen it this show was different. On this visit we looked at all the aviaries and took time to look at and listen to the birds. The growth in the vegetation was noticeable, and even in hot weather, the park looked good. Many of the larger animals, dingoes, emus, kangaroos etc were lethargic or out of sight."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We are campers and debated the value of paying to visit a desert park, given that we have a lot of experience with remote desert camping but this place is fabulous. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and found it to be well organised and very interesting. It's worth it for the bird show alone, which is amazing!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Interesting to see animals that are very hard to find in there natural habitat. You really have to look hard. All contained in good walking distance.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you love birds, reptiles and bush walking you can't go past The Desert Park. A lot to see so make sure you allow a few hours and check beforehand as to feeding and display schedules such as the Wild Bird show and Raptors. Theres also dingoes, Kangaroos, a great Cafe and a Nocturnal Tour. So check it out first."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a conservation facility located 10 minutes from the center of town. We took a guided tour that included a visit to the parks Nature Theater to watch a free-flying bird show. Then we walked in the rain to discover the diversity of desert floral and faunal species indigenous to Australia. The weakest part was our Aboriginal guide who gave a lecture to help us understand his culture and their connection with the desert. Besides being boring our guide appeared to not really want to be there and have no enthusiasm at all. There was a small cafe and gift shop. I was bored the entire time and thought it was a waste of money.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great variety of Desert vegetation, plus many birds and animals. Located close to Alice Springs, within view of the McDonnell Ranges. Great for adults as well as kids."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Well worth a look, but can be very hot in summer. The desert flora and fauna is interesting and the displays are of a high quality. The cafe is a little underwhelming in terms of food offerings. We spent a few hours at the Desert Park and only saw about half of the park!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to visit with the family. Loved the bird show. We spent an entire afternoon at this place. Loved the informative talks. What amazing plants. Kids loved being outside but seeing such amazing scenery and nature.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Wonderful day spent wandering some of central Australia's flora and fauna. Particularly loved the bird life selection and the live show. Lunch was good too
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The whole family loved it. We did the day night ticket. We all enjoyed the day session including a talk about different types of bush food. Then we did the night session. WOW this was excellent. You go in to an area that you don't see during the day and get to see a range of animals you would normally not see. Geoff a guide was very passionate and knowledgeable the keeper that also escorted us qas great as well (and put up with lots of questions from my two boys). We loved doing this and highly recommend doing it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great day out. Bird show fantastic. Nocturnal house blew me away. Few too many school kids who weren't properly supervised that scared many of the animals away. But not the fault of the Desert Park staff. Thoroughly enjoyed our day out here.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very well presented wild life park in natural surroundings. The ""bird of prey"" show was brilliant with the birds seeming to be wild (but not) give an amazing show."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's an awesome trip. They have a cinema, gift shop, amphitheatre, nocturnal house, dingo Territory, perentie, aquarium and desert river aviary. They also have a walking path, bridge, shade area and an exhibit. It's a great recommended for anyone."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Wow. We really loved this place. Can only highly recommend. Would go back again tomorrow if my body would let me. We walked and walked. Saw the bird show, a movie presentation, walk through aviary, and so much very more. The Gift Shop is terrific, as are the staff. Loved the desert grounds, the flora and fauna. It's not far out of town, and there are many options, either a formal tour, part of the Gahn Railway trip, and, as we did, two seniors doing it ourselves. It's well sign posted, you are provided with a map, and any staff member is more than happy to assist you. Take water, and a hat, though there are plenty of drinking water taps throughout the grounds. The walk through aviary is wonderful, especially if you manage some time to be there alone we did have that blessing. There is a video pr sentaion about the formation of the area. I could rave on for ages. Just go, and find out for yourselves."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Amazing experience, We went Early Morning need to spend at least half a day here to truely appreciate the sounds, sights and animals. One of the best i have been too. There are many show and free bird feeding one was a highlight, nice close up encounters so you can clearly see the birds. My daughter(9) loved the Nocturnal House and all the Thorny devils. Nice cafe to sit down and relax at. A Great gift shop if your into that sort of thing too"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you are heading to Alice springs Desert park is definitely on the must do list an awesome day, the set up, the eagle encounter, the food everything was A++ they have done a fantastic job a credit to all that work there :)"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Absolutely wonderful place with lots to see and do. The staff are very helpful and have lots to share!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Firstly do allow yourself some time here, at the very least early morning to mid afternoon. There are many shows across the park and all are worth doing. There are free guided maps available when you enter the park as well a lists of plants, and birds to look out for, and you will see plenty. I crossed off a list of birds and plants that I had never seen before. The red soils of the park covers in wildflowers was spectacular. The frèe flying bird shows are informative. Loved all the avery areas, the nocturnal house is one of the best I've ever seen, and the bush medicine talk was well presented from a very knowledgeable lady who has worked at the park for many years, well worth going to. We had fresh sandwiches, at the onsite cafe. These sort of places are often expensive for food and drinks, the prices here are reasonable with good selection, friendly service. In fact everyone of the staff we met were friendly and looked as they loved their work environment. This is not an animal park, yes there are animals, but primarily it is a desert park featuring the different features of a desert, such as billabongs and regions. Also has a well appointed gift shop. Sadly our time ran out and we missed one of the shows, don't let this happen to you. Great value for the amount of time that could be spent here."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We cycled in on one of the best bike paths we have seen from the city to the park, then spent about 3 hours wandering around on the day tour. The free flight show was great with birds flying round your head at ridiculous speeds; then the relative calm of the remainder of the park. Even just the walk between exhibits was relaxing and interesting, seeing the wildflowers and other plants native to this area. We then returned the following evening for the night tour, an hours trip around a different side of the park with a ranger seeing endangered species. With the provided red headlights, we managed to see echidnas, marlas, bilbys, stick nest rats, wallaby and bandicoot. Really cool. Then hot chocolate and cake to finish a lovely evening. Would definitely recommend doing both tours, tickets bought together get a discount too..."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Please don't miss the chance to visit this Park. A Trip to Central Australia would not be complete. Amazing exhibits. Ride your bike, or walk to this park. You won't be disappointed Funguy and Di"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Lovely park to visit with kids. The staff were knowledgeable and displays were well maintained. We loved the nocturnal house. Try to see the morning bird show as the afternoon show at around 3pm is quite hot.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was a wonderful experience great lay out good information it was very hot but they were very considerate to make sure had plenty of water. The bird display was amazing so well done and informative.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Wow! Fantastic way to end our trip at Alice with the light festival at Desert Park. It's annual so will need to check dates that it starts and finishes. Great indigenous artwork and music. Really glad I found out about it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is a wonderful place to visit, the guides are knowledgeable and very willing to share their knowledge and answer questions. The park is easy to navigate with good maps and signs. The bird show is terrific!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Apart from the excellent bird display at the amphitheater each day, this park is awesome for getting to see those rare tiny, colourful birds that live in the desert. Most bird displays are like bird hides - the birds are in enclosures, but so ample that they seem to go about their daily business as if in the wild. But you do have to sit quietly for a while to appreciate this. An added benefit is that the many bird hides give respite to the hot sun - we did it on a hot 36C day but we managed to while away 4 hours there. Best to get there at opening (8am) when things are most active. Nocturnal house is also excellent with the night animals shifted to daytime hours."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"great showing of beautiful wildlife, especially the many types of birds. great dedicated staff at the venue always around to answer questions"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a different way to learn about the many different desert environments! You cannot miss the Free Flying Show, you become part of the show with birds flying amongst the audience. A unique way for the birds to 'come on stage' too. All the staff are passionate about the park and it's role in conservation and education. Our nocturnal night we got to see all but one of the animals in the habitat, my daughter was most excited about seeing a Bilby. We were a bit disappointed at the number on the tour (30 split into 2 groups of 15) thinking it should be max groups of 10 to be able to view the animals before they move on but found out that one guide was off ill that night, so generally this wouldn't be an issue. Fantastic work being done!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited in a very hot day and still enjoyed it. The presentations are scheduled appropriately and most are of a high standard. The highlight is the bird display - don’t miss it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Animals were not stressed. Loved the nocturnal enclosure The kangaroos were relaxed and right there Great way to see the microclimates when limited on time and availablity Should advertise more as it was a superior experience in our entire trip
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great zoological park and very well done with the displays of desert animal life! Very good presentations by staff!! Worth every penny!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Brilliant concept, staffed by enthusiastic and knowledgeable people. A sample of wild central Australia a few minutes drive from Alice Springs. An absolute must see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As bird shows and desert parks go, this one is top of the heap. Very nicely done. Keep your eyes and ears, but especially your eyes open. There are birds just hiding in plain sight if you look. Good collection from little birds to emu. Raptor show is best."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park was great, but I found the birdshow to be very short, and I found it to be a bit empty or not much activity going on, however a lot of birdlife, a lot of information, quite a long walk, have to be reasonably fit or hire a buggie. I loved the bird sanctuaries"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is another must visit to Central Australia. There is so much to do and very interactive. Make sure you see the cinema show and the nocturnal house is great fun. There are also complimentary barbecue facilities outside the park with toilets, if you do not want to pay an entrance fee."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a great place to see desert plants & animals. The rangers are very knowledgeable. The bird show is xlnt. Great backdrop of the Macdonald Ranges.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This place has a little of everything and a must see. We walked thought the paths of desert flowers and trees and each area pertained a theme. We sat through a bush medicine talk with the ranger showing us the trees and scrubs used then how it was prepared, with witnessed owls, hawks kites and eagles flying to the stage on command and giving us a display or trick. We also saw the dingos, emus, black cockatoos, with the mcdonald ranges as the backdrop. This is a well presented park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very interesting and diverse. Cost was $32 per adult. The bird show was fantastic and the wildflowers amazing. Great place to visit
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were driving past and decided to visit. The park was wonderful, the talks very informative and the Bird show was the best I've seen. A must visit if you're in town"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very informative a bit of a secret and well worth a visit has a nice cafe . Interactive items and good aeroplane section
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A must stop for anyone wanting to know what lives in the middle of Australia. A place for all to spend at least half a day.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Our first visit to the Park and pleasantly surprised with the day. Loved the film, the various segments of the walk and the helpful ranger talks. A great overview and reminder of the desert all around us in this beautiful part of our great country."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We enjoyed it especially the bird show... so clever. Plenty of beautiful plants many with identifying plaques which was very helpful The large avaries were a great opportunity to see the gorgeous small birds. Highly recommend
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were part of a group from the Ghan and stopped here for a lunch organised by the staff from the train. Beautiful place, lovely food and drinks."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a valuable and fascinating way to learn about Central Australia's fauna, flora and indigenous heritage. The bird show was fabulous. The various zones intriguing and full of information. But we are most grateful to Renata who presented two sessions, one about the plants and their nutritional and medicinal value, the other about how the Aboriginal communities in these regions have related to the land in such a respectful and successful way over thousands of years. We learned more in this hour than ever before. We can't recommend this visit highly enough."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park has so much to keep you interested all day. Informative local rangers teach about the local flora, fauna, bush medicine, Aboriginal life and lots more. The live bird show was amazing. Well worth the visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I infrequently give 5 stars, but our visit to the Desert Park at Alice Springs is a definitely not to be missed experience. Informative friendly staff, excellent program, great short film, wonderful representation of different desert areas and birds. I could have spent longer here. Early morning probably the best time to go; but don't miss it"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Mum and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Alice Springs Desert Park. I agree with other reviews that you need to allow plenty of time to really enjoy this Park at a leisurely pace. We were interested more in the flora of each of the desert environments and we just loved the walk in averies that were around to see the beautiful birds. I particularly wanted to see the Sturts Desert Pea which was out in flower and just beautiful! The nocturnal house was not for us unfortunately as mum (83 years) was quite frightened as her eyes didn't seem to adjust to the darkness as well as mine did. We had a quick look but for her it was quite dangerous. We had morning tea and lunch at the cafe which we enjoyed very much. Highly recommend this place when visiting Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We sent around 3 hours winding our way along the bush tracks through many displays all illustrating the desert animals trees and shrubs. Our only disappointment was that we did not see an eagle actually flying, as we had paid extra for this part of the day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Bird show and nocturnal house are a must. Rest is beautiful too. Bit hard to get to and maybe a bit pricey but probably worth it. Shout out to Jeremy for a great talk on Abhoriginal survival skills
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The best natural, nature park we've seen. The Nocturnal House was most impressive. Very caring & helpful staff Well set out and the variety of birds was stunning. Great value for the entrance fee."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited on the way back from Standley Chasm in time for the afternoon bird show, an absolute must see. The birds just arrived into the amphitheatre area as their species was announced. Amazing. We then walked around to see dingoes, emus and various other desert dwellers but unfortunately ran out of time. Would suggest at least half day for a visit. Good convenient parking and an onsite cafe add to the visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We really enjoyed this place. It has good walking tracks and lots of information displayed. The nocturnal house was excellent with quite a few Australian animals we had never seen. The bird show was amazing we definately recommend seeing it when you are there.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The desert park bird show is awesome. The park is generally the best curated environmental display I've been to.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Allow more time than you think and try to get to all the educational things they run as it is all very interesting and just a little bit different. The flight encounter was very special
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"An easy walk with ample parking both ends of the walk. One end is the grave of Rev. John Flynn. You won't be disappointed, the landscape is wonderful."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a wonderful way to end my time in Alice Springs, learning about bush medicines ( very informative), being in the aviaries as the birds flew around, the magic of the nocturnal house, the blooming of wildflowers and ending with the bird show which was very entertaining. Make sure you spend a few hours to see the the different shows."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Highly recommend this park. It is beautifully laid out and full of things to see and lots of information. As you follow the paths you come across exhibits hidden skillfully among the trees. The bird shows were spectacular. The plants and flowers were in bloom. We didn't have time to see all the shows. The paths are easy to navigate for people of all abilities with plenty of seats for a rest if needed. Mobility scooters can be hired for $10. There are water fountains at various points. You are given a comprehensive map of the park layout and helpful instructions on entry.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This turned out to be the highlight of our trip. We spent 5 hours here – a must do is to see the bird show offered twice daily – really amazing what they have been able to demonstrate with “wild” birds. The park located at the base of Macdonnell Ranges and is about a 10 minute drive from Alice Springs. The park is very well kept and it is great to see the diverse range of environments that have been created for visitors to walk through. An interesting talk offered during the day was the Aboriginal Survival in the Desert – stories from an indigenous guide. The guide provided a great insight into the past survival and traditions by the local indigenous communities. An absolute must do, and I recommend doing at the very beginning of your visit, is the watch the Changing Heart Big Screen Movie located in the cinema close to the entrance of the park. This provides a good summary of the environment and a great surprise at the end!!! Overall a really interesting park to visit – well done to all involved."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Was fabulous to go as early as possible to see so many birds, and peaceful, sitting watching Nocturnal animals in there display. Waking and searching for food."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What a wonderful place this is. You have certainly made this into a learning place for the young and old. Start early as there are talks about interesting facts and if you want to attend you have a map of where to go and at what time it starts. The first bush talk starts at 8.30am. I throughly enjoyed the talks on the Aboriginal survival in the desert and Incredible edibles in the bush. Very interesting. My favourite was the Nocturnal House. Only disappointing thing was the cafe. They must only sell pre packed food because we went in at 12.30 for some lunch and only 1 pie was left.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You need to spend most of the day, at least from the 9:15 am dingo talk through 10 am birds show and 11 am aboriginal culture talk ending 12:30. More talks later on. Each is given only once a day and are good detail. I would have liked to see a talk on marsupials. They have a few mammals, birds, reptiles, good nocturnal animal house to visit during the day. You can get a good deal on roundtrip transportation plus admission from the Youth Hostel in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Dessert Park is a great achievement of the people of Alice Springs and deserves at least two hours but could need longer. There is a café there if refueling is needed.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Lots of walking (wear comfy shoes), missed the shows (due to timing), but we walked most area and read the sign, we enjoyed this relaxing surrounds of this place"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great family day out! Can recommend the daily bird show was amazing. There's a fair bit of walking so bring comfortable shoes. If you have the chance do the night time nocturnal tour, really cool experience, desert and coffee afterwards is a bonus."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We spent a few hours at this park and indeed what a surprise it was. All the different fauna and flora
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My only dissapointment was that some displays were empty. Dingos etc. Souvenir shop quite expensive compared to others in Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great place to spend a few hours. There's lots to see in terms of native animals such as dingoes, a myriad of birds, emus, etc. and there's also a nocturnal enclosure where you get to see some really cool and some quite rare/endangered native creatures. We were treated to a talk on Lara the Barn Owl. It was very informative and interesting. Thanks Angus! And thanks also to Greg, another ranger, who explained all about the bush coconut. Don't forget also to pay attention to the flora here. There are some lovely flowering shrubs as well as trees, some of which have medicinal or food significance for indigenous peoples."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a lovely morning strolling around the park. There was me, my hubby our daughter, her partner & our 3yr old granddaughter. I was easy too for pushing a stroller/pram. At the time of our visit the desert peas were out, they were beautiful to see. They had walk through aviary's with birds & butterflies. The most enjoyment we got was in the nocturnal house. We spent a good hour in there. Our granddaughter was just fascinated in the animals being so active."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is an itneresting place but value for money was expensive. To see the general displays and bird show was great.. very disappointing to find out to see the dingo's or the eagles cost even more money. A lot of care and consideration has been put into this park but it was really expensive and I don't know how families could afford to go.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is a wonderfully maintained and presented bit of Central Australia. Cool animals, carefully and tastefully maintained, and informative presentations. The bird show is a gem. Don't miss it!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went as a family in July to the Alice Springs Desert Park. The park is beautiful and well set out. We went early to catch the first talk on the kangaroos - really recommend if you want to get to it that you are in the park by 8.00 am as it starts at 8.30 and this will give you time to grab tickets, learn about what is on offer in the park, orientate yourself and walk the 10 minutes to the presentation area. Paths are easy to negotiate and are wheelchair friendly. If you choose the self guide tour it is a pleasant walk and there is plenty of information provided in the park.. but I would recommend the ranger/guide talks that are held approx. every hour on habitats, animal species, indigenous foods and medicines and how the indigenous people managed the land and resources. The park is divided into habitats and the nocturnal We have four daughters that range in age from 6-15 years... the younger two did enjoy the talks for a while... but them got a bit restless. Luckily for me, my husband took them back to the hotel for a swim (you can get pass outs for the day) and came back later in the afternoon for the shows/talks that they were more interested in. This left me free to go and enjoy every talk! Jeremy and Matty were great guides and very engaging; and the bird shows (2 per day) were fantastic! Great crowd engagement and amazing to see the wild birds interacting with the free flying Desert Park birds - if just a bit nerve wracking at times - the keepers were amazing with their birds... they are obviously very well loved and well kept. The shows were slightly different in morning and afternoon... so really recommend seeing both. Toilet facilities were very clean and well appointed. There is an onsite café, too. And we really recommend the 20 minute cinema show... the end is AMAZING and left us all gobsmacked and unable to move for five minutes... even the kids!!! We returned that night to attend the nocturnal walk and this was a great experience. The area is fenced and well protected from predators and the walk is gentle with infrared light headbands provided to negotiate paths. You are guaranteed to see at least a few animals on the tour but the variety will vary according as the animals will roam free. We were lucky to see just about every species on our walk and the children were really engaged. Afterwards you are provided with cake, coffee, tea or hot chocolate - perfect on a cold winter's night. The guides/keepers were again, excellent."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The AS desert park was a very interesting day out. When you go, check times for the dingo talk and bird show and the aboriginal information talk, all well worth the time and shouldnt be missed. In between you can roam at leisure to view amazing bird life, native animals and beautiful plant life. The Sturt peas were in full bloom, absolutely beautiful. The staff are amasingly friendly and informative. Matt (hope I have recalled the name correctly) is full of information about dingoes and Ann was so interesting in regard to the local aboriginal culture. This is a must do in AS."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This really is one of the best Australian flora and fauna destinations we have been to! What a location, framed by the MacDonnell Range. The desert landscapes throughout the park are beautifully designed, yet always retain the natural feel of the Central Outback. Shows and presentations are first rate - we're still talking about the Bird Show, wow! and I'm someone who's not at all a fan of the contrived Australiana in some of the better known theme parks. Aviaries, and other fauna installations are first rate, and the Nocturnal facility is definitely the best we've been to. We went for 2 hrs, and stayed for 5, and still missed several shows and presentations. If you want an authentic yet thoroughly stimulating outback nature experience, don't miss the Desert Park when you're in Alice. Oh, and make sure you stay in your seats to the end of the short movie in the Cinema - another great touch!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is a Must Go To site in the Territory. If you are staying in the area for a few days, you could choose to spread your visit over two half days. There is enough of interest to suit all age groups and interests."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent almost the whole day here - fabulous to be so up close to the little birds as well as the big ones, and the reptiles in the nocturnal display, which is excellent."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The ticket clerk was less than friendly, but the facility is well maintained and spacious, with a good selection of Australian outback animals and birds. We went at 4pm when the heat was less, and really enjoyed the raptor and owl show. The roos were just starting to stir as the afternoon sun faded to sunset. The bird cages are replete with lovely birds. It is a nice enough place, good for a couple hours of strolling around the desert scenery, but he admission price is a bit stiff. Be sure to bring a water bottle and refill it at the various water fountains, as you will dry out fast. There is a nice movie in the auditorium, worth the time. Gift shop is quite decent, albeit pricey."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spending a few hours here is really worthwhile to get close to creatures you wont easily see in the wild (including in the nocturnal house). The bird flying display was a highlight as are the aviarys. If its going to be hot suggest a morning visit. They also have mobility scooters for those who need them. Avoid the days the Ghan Train is in town as apparently they flood the joint!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is pretty much the best tourist attraction in Alice. Great location, lots of interesting displays, and as everyone else has said, the Nocturnal House is world class. The free flight display is interesting (and different to the one at Healesville Sanctuary). Easy to spend a couple of hours wondering around here and it is (the day we went) very uncrowded. There is a good cafe/bistro and a great choice of quality souvenirs. The Park also has an 1.5 hr Nocturnal Tour (at 7.30pm) which you can book - spotlight animals in a predator-proof enclosure, incudes refreshment. It would be an ideal introduction to some of the amazing desert animals that few people will see in the wild. Tour runs Monday to Friday and you book by phoning the Park. Keep up the great work....we'll be back soon."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A short taxi ride from the town centre, this nature park is a must-do for those interested in the birds, animals and plants of the central desert as well as Indigenous knowledge of surviving off the land. The highlight is the Free Flying Bird Show, in which a variety of genuinely wild birds arrive on cue and fly low over the audience while a guide describes their behaviour. Extraordinary! Don't miss the Nocturnal House to see vulnerable and endangered native species. You can see everything in a half day visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a fascinating place well worth visiting for the nocturnal house alone. Very knowledgeable guides and good signage provided lots of interesting information.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Desert park is a natural park next to Alice spring which is a collection of planets and rare animals with interesting adaptations for surviving in harsh conditions. Today, I have a brief visit from Desert park in the late afternoon but I missed all interesting shows , starting from early morning. The staff were so helpful specially Katie in reception desk and Paul who is manager. They tried to help me but it was too late to see animals. So, my advice is going to the Desert Park early and enjoy the beauty of nature."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,If you are in Alice Springs...put aside at least 4 hours to visit this wonderful park. Very special.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"ok lets start, its not your typical zoo, its way better, its informative, relaxed with plenty of room its inhabitants and visitors, no pushing or shoving etc but very relaxed. the bird display was 1st class, the handler was superb, knowledgeable and obviously enjoyed what he did, it was made all the better by the amazing backdrop which in all honesty is fantastic. there is lots to see here, i could ramble on, but you come to see for yourself, and if your less than able bodied bring your wheel chair"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs is a small city, pretty much 5 minutes to everything. We went to the Desert Park on a morning in July so the weather was just cool. The birds are amazing. You can get into the sanctuary/cage to play with them. The reptile tunnel (this is what I call it) is a good spot for families with young kids. You will see a lot of wild lives in the desert which you may have never known. Remember don't use flash in the dark! Saw a family with a teenage girl maybe learning taking photos with a cheap DSLR with the flash on! I told her to stop it. The animals are so adapted to the darkness and your freaking flash can make them blind. Think it is worth reminding the tourists before they go."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I recommend visiting Desert Park at the start of your visit to the Red Centre. It provides a good introduction to the different types of desert environments. As you walk through the different environments there is good interpretation of the plants, animals and geography. There are a number of talks/shows scheduled during the day. We attended the bird show and it was excellent. We spent about three hours in the park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great areas -well set out. the nocturnal area was terrific. Great information and we were able to do things at our own pace
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We were not sure if this desert park would be our thing - but we were so pleased we went. Just loved the amazing variety of flora and fauna displayed in beautifully set up enclosures. Easy viewing spaces plus some 'walk through' areas - full of stunning plants and animals. Really helpful and knowledgable staff too.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The layout of the park and the exhibits are very good. The bird show is remarkable, unlike any seen so far. The animals are treated well and the park rangers are kind and courteous. All the staff are responsive to guests needs and very helpful."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had not seen a lot of wildlife on this trip so decided to go to the park. Great displays but the highlight is the bird show. Brilliant.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was a lot of money for a family of four. Missed last bird of prey show by 2minutes with a distraught daughter we were only offered a discounted return the next day to see it. Disappointing when we've been to places that offer passes valid for 2 days that offer a lot more to see. Nocturnal house saved our visit. Without that i would have said stay away.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A must do if you are in Alice Springs! The bird show is thrilling, the Nocturnal house was spectacular with a huge range of little desert critters and the various settings give great information and teaching. The staff are friendly and willingly answer any questions and display great knowledge of their subjects. The backdrop of the West MacDonnel ranges is eye candy galore!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A very disappointing park. A couple of kangaroos, one emu and an empty dingo enclosure!!! Plenty of birds but not much else. Kids left disappointed and so did I. Wouldn't recommend wasting your money."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We took our 2 daughters 5 & 7 along with my parents 60yo and we had a really wonderful day. Highlights were the guide talks but we only were able to see Matt and his love of reptiles 👍. We were all completely blown away with the bird show. Well worth the day if you enjoy bird life from the desert.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent a half day and went to the amphitheater for the bird show at 3.30. What an experience that was. You can get great photos up close and the handlers were exceptional. The nocturnal house, along with all the small bird enclosures were very very good. This is a must do activity in Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the Desert Park in July, so the weather was cool. Could be very hot in summer. Interesting displays of birds and animals. The nocturnal house and the bird show are a must. Get to the cafe early for lunch as they tend to run out of many items. The shop has the usual tourist items for sale at the usual inflated prices."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,we recently visited the park and whilst the bird show was good to see the park as a whole is overpriced at almost $90 for a family pass. we also found the attitude of the staff/volunteers at the park to be extremely disappointing and unwelcoming to families traveling with kids and on several occasions were berated by staff because the kids had dared to step a metre off a path to look at a plant or bird.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Always a delightful experience visiting here. Watching the animals grow as well as the plants changing according to the seasons and the weather. Don't miss the bird show.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fabulous time spent here. Great to see so many animals, birds and nocturnal House is very well displayed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What a fantastic place to visit in Alice. Give yourself plenty of time to see all the animals and displays- at least 3 hours. We went after lunch and were able to see the amazing bird show. There are various talks throughout the day. If you only have time to do one thing in Alice make it this one!!!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The combination of self-guided tracks and ranger talks was excellent. The movie is really worth a look and the bird show is a must. We were fortunate to visit during NAIDOC Week and experience some excellent cultural talks.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Stopped in here for a visit and decided to book in for the Wedgetail experience. Wow. It was a true highlight and an awesome one. We also did the various information sessions given by Jeremy throughout the morning. Very, very interesting and he also through in a few funny stories. Well done. All in all we had a great time. The Desert Park is a very worthwhile visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Bit of a rushed trip for me and did not have the opportunity to get involved in the guided tours. They sound really worthwhile and there are quite a few to choose from so give yourself 3-4 hours.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Enjoyed this place. Kiwi out in the desert hahaha. Staff friendly & helpful. From the time you arrived until the time you left you were welcomed & felt looked after. Great for all.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,You need to allocate at least half a day to get the best out of a visit to the Desert Park. Time spent is well worth it. The part we enjoyed the most was the Free Flying Bird Show. Highly recommendd
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great place for anyone to experience the wildlife that outback Australia has to offer. Love the nocturnal section, the kids enjoyed that."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Did it with my friend. Pretty nice to do but not very amazing for young adults. Would be nice as a family trip though.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We did not know what to expect when we arrived. After the guide told us about the layout of the areas we headed off. The movie showing at regular times is good to see initially. The display areas are a mixture of closed in walk though aviary's and enclosures for other animals. All areas were very well laid out and informative.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This tour was part of The Ghan off train excursions and the highlight was the wild native bird experience - not to be missed. The park overall is wonderful, with lots to see especially the night-life display. Lunch was included in the tour and was excellent."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great way to learn about the Fauna and Flora of the interior, lots of information available and a great bird show. Also if you like bird watching its a good place to pick up species."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My parents and I visited this park while on a trip to Alice. It was a wonderful experience but wasn't exactly what I had expected. In my head I thought it was more like a zoo so if you go with that in mind you may be disappointed. They have a few Australian animals but mostly they have a lot of lovely native plants with boardwalks to stroll along. They have some great informative sessions about Indigenous culture, bush tucker/medicine etc and I enjoyed the bird show. We were a little disappointed with the cafe as the kitchen closed at 1.30 (we were there at 1.20 but was already closed) and so we were left with the option of a small range of sandwiches or meat pies/sausage rolls. They did have a nice amount of baked goods though which were yummy. All in all we had a great day here wondering around and attending the sessions."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Nice park with lots of walking tracks and picnic spots, tables and chairs set up for visitors, a kiosk available and over all a peaceful place to sit and enjoy the local wildlife"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What a wonderful attractions easy to spend 5hours Flights of Birds great but my favourite was the talk and display on aboriginal way of life great avairy and nocturnal display also
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park was a great place to visit as it incorporates the desert vegetation types, all set out in different areas with walkways between, various compounds with birds & viewing area, a walk in avairy, open area with birds in flight display as well as a nocturnal house with all kinds of desert creatures on display. We enjoyed our visit & would recommend this as a good activity to do."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to visit. Very informative and value for money. Really enjoyed the bird show. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable. Great way to learn more about the desert flora and fauna.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Spent five hours here quite happily. The talks were interesting. The displays were great. The best things about this place were the location beneath the McDonnell ranges and the bird displays. Book in to the one on one with the wedgie - you wont be disappointed. The gift shop is great, but you can give the cafe a miss."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I was impressed with the level of information and number of animals featured from the red centre. As an east coast native it was great to see a lot more of the species found throughout the middle of Australia and learn detailed information.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"In my opinion, this park is a must when visiting Alice. So much work and effort has gone into creating the different desert environments for the various wildlife found in Central Australia. It was wonderful to see these animals close up. There is so much to see and absorb. It would have been great to make another visit to see and do more, even though we spent four hours there and saw the fabulous bird show."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you only have one day in Alice Springs, this is the place to go to learn about the Outback. I spent all day because I went to each of the hourly talks, or you can spend less time doing a self-paced tour and not going to the shows or talks. The Noctural House was my very favorite. I also loved the talk about Aboriginal Survival in the Desert. If you're into birds, the aviaries and the bird show are very cool. The park is definitely a lot of walking but there's water fountains, shade and a cafe. The guides are amazingly knowledgeable! Go early if you want to see the dingos and kangaroos doing something other than sleeping. This park is good for all ages. The path may be too far to walk for some but the park had great handicapped accessibility for wheelchairs and motorized scooters."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Excellent exhibition of what the red centre is all about. Would definitely recommend doing it especially the wonderful bird show!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park is a wonderful attraction that gave us a wonderful insight into the wild life of the area as well as the desert itself. The free flight bird show is a must see, very cleverly put together and the guy who ran it had a great sense of humour. We enjoyed a couple of hours strolling around here looking at the reptiles and plant life as well. Would be even better for children."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Nocturnal house was great. Bird Show was amazing but was hoping for a couple of Wedge Tails! The birds they did have were fantastic.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We did both the day and night visit,and didnt think the park lived up to what we believed it would be,we should have only done one ,not both as they are about the same,the only good thing about the night was the Rangers gave an insight the the problems our mammels are dealing with.( ferrel cats etc)"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You must follow the program and do the shows. First one we did was a talk on how aborigines lived and existed, showing us weapons, tools etc. fascinating, next a tour of the nocturnal house, great, a talk on traditional medicines, fantastic, a bird show that wasn't bad, but other than the shows I found the park to be somewhat devoid of anything much to see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Interesting place. So much to see including birds from The Bird of Prey show. You can walk around or take a motorised chair as it is flat. Very hot whilst we were there so take water. Staff well informed and able to answer questions for you.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We did an all day tour as part of an excursion from the Ghan. A really good mixture. The Bird of Prey show was good rather than great. The nocturnal house was wonderful and we were able to see animals such as bilby and numbat. The guides were wonderful and had red lights to point the animals out. Also had plenty of opportunity to see other parts of the park, with plants, birds and animals. They had mobility scooters which a few people on our tour utilised. Full marks for the way that the exhibits are displayed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Amazing place to visit. So much to see and do. Well informed and welcoming staff who took time to answer questions and share their expertise. The birds of prey exhibition was an awesome highlight. Can't praise this venue enough.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,You can catch a bus out to the park or hire bikes in Alice to ride out it's very pleasant walking around the park and plenty of information to see. The bird show put on would really interest children
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Wonderful visit to see mammals and bird show. Very impressed with bird show. A must attraction when visiting Alice springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Was told by friends to visit the Desert Park and was so glad we did. Just make sure you arrive at either the morning or afternoon bird demonstrations. Lots of other local birds in large cages plus emus, dingos and kangaroos. The nocturnal displays were outstanding."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Loved this place. Spent the whole day there. Informative talks and great exhibits. Highly recommend the experience.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"There's not a lot to do in Alice Springs, so if you have some time you should certainly do this. Quite remarkable demonstration of raptor training. And not overly theatrical. Good to have a fast camera with a long lens if you want to capture the performance."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We always love going to the Desert Park! The landscaping is gorgeous and the animal exhibits are lovely, although as simple as you might expect for a small place like Alice Springs. The park has special events at various times throughout the year, which always make it fresh and exciting. But even the day-to-day events (such as the bird show) are worth seeing. Definitely worth spending an afternoon here!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We made a dreadful decision planning our visit to Alice Springs Desert Park (ASDP). We didn't allow enough time. We were on route to the airport and decided on a last-minute visit due to flight delays. Our view was that we would have a quick visit, see everything and get out in quick time. How wrong we were. With only an hour available, we didn't do the park justice. Even though we had decent time with the nocturnal animals, dingo’s and aviary birds, it was rushed. Regarding the nocturnal house, I can also honesty say I’ve never been so close to an inquisitive brown snake. Thankfully, it was behind glass. Not sure it made me feel any better. The rushed visit also meant we missed out on animal/bird shows along with educational tours the park has on offer. We thought the kids (4 & 6) would find it a little boring, but, wrong again. Our kids LOVED it and giggled as they raced from one animal to another. I also like how they separated sections of the park to illustrate different aspects of Australia i.e. desert rivers, sand country, woodland. Really well done. If in Alice Springs and new to outback Australia, this really should be on your list of attractions. The park provides great insights on what to expect when you start to explore the outback yourself. Just make sure you allow enough time. Enjoy."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The park is split into different kinds of desert areas. All are very well tended and interesting to look through. The nocturnal house was really well set out (a bit creepy actually) for people scared of snakes and spiders! The talks given around the park by Ranger Jeremy were really interesting and worth watching your watch for. The bird show was incredible. The whole park was really well sign posted and the maps easy to read.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a great place this is. We took a mile long walk with an Aboriginal guide who was one of the park rangers. She showed us so much about the plants that were growing all around us, the animals living on the land and in the trees, especially the kangaroos and the raptors, and the culture of the Arrernte, Aboriginal people, who have lived in the region for thousands of years. The park is over 3,000 acres in size and it is an encyclopedia of Outback knowledge to anyone who visits it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A first rate attraction with authentic wildlife and Australian flora excellently presented. The guided talks and bird display were very informative. An essential part of the Northern Territory desert experience.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Learned so much! And what a beautiful park-- there's a sign there that reads ""you'll never look at the Desert the same way!"" The parks opens early -- be there at 0730 & you'll have the place to yourself. From the entry point, go left around the park, clockwise. Really nice relaxing aviary spots with most beautiful birds...and you'll see kangaroos, dingos. There's even an Aviary Show with a Magpie, a Barn Owl, a Bussard, and a Raptor. And the Nocturnal House-- The BEST part of the park...bats, snakes, little critters of all kinds. My favorite little guy -- the Spinifex Hopping Mouse. Too cute! Don't miss this to truly gain an appreciation of the flora & fauna that The Red Center has to offer."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Don't miss this! Nature Theatre provides a breathtaking display of birds of prey. Can't begin to imagine how this is done, but do not miss it! Also, do not miss the nocturnal house: you may have to look closely before you see some of the creatures, but they are there!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I went to the Desert Park just before my trek on the Larapinta Trail, as recommended by Larapinta Trail Trek Support (LTTS) to give me an idea of the flora, fauna, landscapes and cultural heritage of the area. I'm so glad I did it because it gave me an excellent introduction to the area. The Aboriginal guides and their talks or presentations were just amazing! My hike on the Larapinta Trail was hugely enhanced by the knowledge and info I got at the desert park. Thank you to all the staff there. Super facilities. Great work. Loved my time in Central Australia :)"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I had been told that the Desert Park was a 'must see' when visiting Alice Springs and it didn't disappoint. The Birds of Prey show is worth the cost of the admission alone. The wildlife handlers are very impressive. The nocturnal house is also great. The park has mobility scooters for hire which made it much easier for me to get around. Daytime temperatures can get quite high in Alice Springs but there are plenty of shade shelters in the park. But I would still advise visitors to avoid the middle of the day, take a hat and plenty of water."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"So many things to see and do. Take plenty of water as you will cover a lot of ground. The displays are outstanding. Raptor show was stunning to watch. The Aboriginal talk with artifacts was highly educational. At least 1/2 day to get a good feel for what they offer. A great summary of the animals, plants and people of the Northern Territory. Well,worth your time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had visited this park a number of years ago when on the Ghan but we had visitors from Scotland and so we went again. It is a fascinating place which really highlights the various habitats. We spent all afternoon there so don't skimp on the time you allow. A special tip is make sure you see the film presentation if possible, before you go around the park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a wonderful experience, especially the birds of prey show, just brilliant. It was easy to wander around even for those with walking difficulties, well sign posted with outstandingly friendly and knowledgable staff. There weren't many options available at the cafe for lunch. We had visited Olive Pink gardens the day before and were very disappointed at the state of the plants, and the whole set up seemed neglected. The Desert Park was even better by comparison as well maintained, irrigated and many plaques and explanations of exhibits. The nocturnal house was a start attraction. We could have spent all day in the park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The gardens, story telling and wildlife always deliver a beautiful experience, I visit each time I am in Alice for work. or play. Go !"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Highly enjoyed this small but charming animal park. Lots of birds, kangaroos and a fascinating nocturnal animal exhibit. The bird snow is a must."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As a local and photographer, I have visited Desert Park many times and take my photography students there. They love to photograph the bird life, the plants and the native animals as everything is very accessible. We are always impressed by the knowledge and passion of the friendly guides."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The bird show was good but the rest of the park was pretty small with exception to nocturnal exhibit.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This Park has a lot to offer and is a leisurely stroll that opens up to the beauty of the wildlife and natures best.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I visited the Desert Park and shortly after that visit, I crossed the Simpson Desert itself, in relative luxury, with the iconic Australian travel team, Outback Spirit. From Alice Springs via 4wd convoy to Birdsville, then a flight back to Alice Springs. As with the arrival in the Desert Park, and later in the Simpson Desert, at first appearance there seems to be little there. How wrong that first impression is! With knowledgeable people beside you, and your own senses, the desert comes alive. It is such a rewarding experience for your senses - COLOURS and patterns - silence and bird calls - desert dryness and breezes - coolness in the morning, heat in the middle of the day - tough textures of desert plants, delicate and fragile flowers, armoured seed pods, lacy aerial seeds - that heady taste of adventure - the soaring of your soul. The Desert Park features several presentations over the course of the day. Don't miss any of them! From close up encounters with wonderful birds, to bush tucker talks interlaced with aboriginal legends and multi-generational bush lore. Jeremy gave the bush lore presentation. He is like the desert too - at first he seems a quiet and shy man, but watch out for his dry (how apt) sense of humour! It sneaks up on you. Allow the full day is my tip!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We spent five hours at the Alice Springs Desert Park. Our advice is go early and see all the displays. We arrived just before 9am and saw the dingo display followed by the free-flying bird display and the aboriginal food display. The free-flying bird display is as good as any that I have seen.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,$32 per person to enter but it was worth it. Long walking track showing the different terrains and a chance to get up close to kangaroos. The nocturnal house was also brilliant. The bird show was really good but we missed the other presentations.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Really enjoyed visiting the park. The landscape was amazing and the staff were very friendly and informative. We attended a few of the talks including a bird show which was fantastic.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The visit was to be a fill in for an hour or two, 6 hours later we were loving it. So well set out and supper informative. I will never look at a desert the same agoan. The Raptor show was very entertaining and great information was shared. The desert survival talk by a local Jeremy was hilarrious and infomative , stories of his childhood made it so real. We all loved it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We got to know about this park through a documentary we watched during our one day Uluru tour with Emu run the day before. We were on time to watch the bird show at the amphitheater, we were very impressed with the birds and the information from the park ranger. The park had so much to offer on desert life, it was just great. We spent about three hours taking our time through each area of the park. The nocturnal centre not to be missed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was my third visit to the Desert Park and I loved every minute of it. So well laid out and maintained and extremely informative. The animal/bird exhibits are fantastic.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Well worth the visit. A good way to see so many aspects of desert life. The live presentations are very informative. It gets very busy, so arrive early to beat the heat and the crowd. The presentations are on a schedule, so plan your route to see them all."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is outstanding park and an ideal park to see Australian animals and learn about bush tucker. The birds of prey display is excellent. An excellent 4 hours well spent.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The guide wasn't very informative, but the sights were great, although the same, and there was even a bird show! Great place to visit with the family."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent a day here doing all of the shows and talks that they provided and it was informative, interesting and generally a great way to spend the day. You get a better understanding of the environment around you, how the animals and people have survived in this harsh climate. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Would recommend this to everyone. It certainly makes your trips around Alice and areas more interesting as you look for plants and animals you saw in the park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As others have said, our group got a very warm welcome when we arrived and were given maps, which were incredibly inaccurate- they showed for examples two paths from the entrance and there was only one. In the park itself, it's very clear that all the animals are very well cared for and have plenty of space. There are also great things to see, but signage is very poor to non-existent- several of us made our way to the nocturnal house, but everyone but me gave up because there was appeared to be nothing ahead of us, and no signs to say we were on the right track. Comparing notes, afterwards, not one of the fifteen of us could find the aquarium shown on the map, and there never seemed to be anyone around to ask. At one stage, I even went into a Staff Only area, as we had been round the cassowary enclosure three times trying to find the next section of the park-we were directed back to the same route so wasted a lot of time. There's huge potential but there seems to an attitude of complacency in the staff and certainly not enough staff going round to assist. Some others in my group met a party of Australians visiting, who actually apologised as they were so embarrassed ""what must you think?"" they apparently asked. When we finally got back to the centre, the café was closed. There were no opening hours displayed on the café (it was only 4pm, hardly late); not even a closed sign. It's a shame, as this could be such a great experience. My opinion is that management is at fault. I'd recommend they get in touch with Clelland Wildlife Park which knows how to do it far better-clear signs (with pictures of animals throughout the park, clear and accurate maps, and so on. I have put ""more than 3 hours"" as recommended time to visit because that includes time for getting lost several times tanks to the absence of signs and inadequate map."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Prepare yourself for a hot walking day; so go early and enjoy the experience. Lots of scheduled talks and your own chance to walk around the different habitats: woodland, desert and grassland. Plenty of birds to see at large. And heaps of enclosures with lizards, birds and marsupials for your pleasure. The nocturnal house was huge: with wonderful animals on all sides. Every ranger we met was well informed and helpful; and we all loved the bird show, so make sure you are there by 10 am!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a fabulous day! From the lovely welcome, the attractions, exhibits and guides, we could not have spent a more wonderful 6 hours."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My sister an I spent a half day at this most wonderful park. We are elderly and our walking is limited but we aere able to thoroughly explore the exhibits using the electric buggies. We joined all available guided tours to hear the fantastic guides talk about exhibits. The night enclosure is a must. Here all nocturnal animals are out and about for you believing day has been turned into night. Try to be there for the bird display. If you do nothing else in A,ice Springs do this."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a must-see attraction in Alice Springs. It is a beautifully designed and maintained wildlife park featuring different desert habitats and a great range of wildlife in very well designed displays and enclosures. Don't miss the bird display, which is worth the price of admission on its own. You can easily spend the whole day here - but bring lunch (or go down the road to Yaye's at Araluen) as the cafe (in contrast to everything else about the place) is dreadfully disappointing."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park takes you very close to much of the natural life of this area. It nestles in the foothills of the stunning MacDonnell ranges and takes you through a number of local ecosystems. A gentle walk, best done in the cool of the day, takes you around the whole park. Friendly and helpful staff direct you to special exhibits, talks or shows. We went to the Aboriginal Survival talk and it was interesting, informative and fun. Good for all ages. Don't miss it if you are in the area."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Overpriced since there's almost nothing outside except for 2 lonely dingoes that can be seen at any campground, Emus that you can see on a road trip, most other creatures are hiding and can't be seen in the vast emptiness. The nocturnal house is a bit of a bonus because you can actually see a biliby but nothing special apart from that. Technically speaking, if the facility was not so big, you could cover seeing all creatures within a span of 15 minutes and still have time for an ice cream at the cafe so $32 is not worth it all all"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"$33 admission. They have a map and events throughout the day. A short drive from the town centre, maybe 10-15mins. We chose the cinema event. This gives you how the outback came to be from a vast ocean covering the whole interior of australia. Saw the emu and dingo, but during the day they are in the shade and out of site. Staff are friendly and the highlight of the day was the talk on how the indigeounous community eat and lives off the land. Another highlight was the bird show with Owls, Kites and Falcons putting on a show. Well worth the $33 spent."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A wonderful way to enjoy seeing and learning about so many of the natural inhabitants of the area - Awesomely handsome Rory, the rescued Wedge Tailed Eagle at the Eagle Encounter; owls, falcons and more at the wild bird show; a nocturnal house displaying multiple types of local snakes both large and small, dingoes, emus and more. The park is spread over an area of the very land it teaches about and includes a cafe, gift shop and reasonably priced scooters for those with mobility issues."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very patient and informative guides. Accommodated for all ages in our group from 3yrs to 63yrs. Loved our tour. Thanks
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were fortunate enough to hear about the open day at Desert Park last week. It was free entry to all but even at the normal price this is a great value, great fun day out. The staff are always friendly. The large enclosures for the range animals including dingos, emus and kangaroos allow easy, close up viewing. The animals are relaxed and clearly happy. The high points are the bird enclosures where us humans can enter, here the longer one spends the more one sees. The nocturnal house offers a chance to see the desert animals that it is near impossible to see in the wild: billies, bandicoots, hopping mice, malars and many more. Because it is Alice Springs there is never a crowd, even on the open day, kids can go right up to the glass and run along with the animals just inside. A super venue and a super day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited the Desert Park first thing in the morning and throughly enjoyed our guided tour of the park. We were fortunate to see lots of animals and birds. There was also a talk on Aboriginal life in the desert. The bird show was very well done and shouldn't be missed. You really should add this stop to your itinerary.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I like love this park. It's run by an aboriginal coop (I think) ... the guides were very informative... loved hearing about the bush tucker and bush medicine. The free flight bird show is a must.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It was on our list and our taxi driver from the airport also said it should be at the top of our list while in Alice Springs. It did not disappoint. Arriving in Alice at midday with two kids in tow (5 and 8 years old) we checked in and decided to educate ourselves on the environment we're spending the next two weeks in. While we arrived in the early afternoon there were still plenty of activities going on. Aside from the displays of the various ecosystems including flora and fauna of we also heard the Incredible Edibles talk (bush tucker and bush medicine) and saw the free flight bird show. The kids enjoyed both, tasting a bush raisin and aweing at the birds (including owls and raptors). The cinema presentation also provided a good history of the region from the very beginning of time to now. Both kids enjoyed the park and we spent just under 4 hours here. One of the highlights for the kids was seeing a real wild snake along the paths, but also the reptile exhibits introducing us all to the Thorny Devil for the first time too. It was a great introduction for us to the area and has got us even more excited about the adventures ahead. It wasn't cheap at $87 for the family but we were also provided a return option for $13.75 if we wanted to return another day in the next week. Given we spent so long here is testament to its value for us all and would we recommend it? Yes!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Visited here with our teen. He loved the bird show and seeing some of the wildlife native to the area. He really enjoyed his visit but we should have come earlier in the day as it was 32 degrees!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great wildlife Park in the desert. A must to see for the birds of prey show and the park is well layout for east walking around.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is a ""must do"" in Alice Springs. You will get up close to dingos and kangaroos. The nocturnal house was great. Time your visit for one of the free flight bird shows. Take one of the free tours."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My visit to the Desert Park was a surprisingly pleasant experience. The organization of the park is well done and being varied and adequately detailed results in a memorable and informative experience. Each area of the park is complete in itself but so well done it encourages you to continue to the next area. It can, of course, be hot, so carry adequate water but shelter from the sun is available and there is an on site café. The nocturnal house is fascinating ( and cool). Highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I visited the Alice Springs Desert Park on Sunday for the 20th Birthday celebrations. The program was excellent. the food was good. the bush tucker talk was very well done. The music to end the day was also excellent.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Had a great few hours at the park. Set in such a natural environment. Our favourite part was the Cultural/Bush tucker talk with Jeremy. Very informative.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited this park and we were most delighted to see how well this was organized and managed. Most impressive was the bird show. The nocturnal house was just fantastic. Many other parc can learn here how to do it right.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Arrived at 9.30am and just in time for the Flying Bird show which was just sensational. Also visited the Survival in Desert talk and the Nocturnal Dine In and Take Away session. We spent 4 hours in the park and enjoyed every minute. Family pass at $87 was great value.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The desert park is worth every dollar of the admission price. The nocturnal house and the twice a day bird show were highlights for me.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We love animals and the Park is very well done. You can see birds snakes mammals of the desert in their natural environment but 32 dollars is way too much and be sure you come before 4.30 even if official clos in time is 6pm. They will not let you in.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to visit. Very informative guides and lots to see. Good coverage of all the flora and fauna of the area. Also great that they have water fountains available because it was 40o when we visited and needed to refill a couple of times.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very interesting displays of birds, animals and reptiles throughout the park All displays well presented with easy to read information. The nocturnal house and the free flying birds displays were highlights. Great facilities with water coolers strategically located throughout the park, café and information/gift shop."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A definite must do when in Alice Springs. Desert Park is a wonderfully set out area with lots to see. The bird show is excellent, great place to get up close and personal to Kangaroos, although you don't get to pet or feed them. It's great no matter what time of year but if possible winter time would be best. If doing it in the summer like us be prepared for a lot of heat."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"So many beautiful birds on show at the desert park. Bring good walking shoes and a pram if you have young kids as the exhibits are not close together, which is good because it is beautiful to walk around the whole park. The morning bird show is great. The avaries really let you get up close to a number of birds, we were able to stand right next to a black cockatoo and a kingfisher. Nocturnal house well worth a visit especially for the numbats."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Our guide was an aborigine man who told us of the many plants and animals of the Outback of Australia. The bird show was outstanding in demonstrating the flight, the habits of birds of Australia. The birds would fly just over our heads providing great pictures of the birds. The lunch area served hot meat pies, a common Australian lunch item. The iced coffee was very refreshing on a 90+ degree F. day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I was attracted to this place because of the flora and the artwork and wasn't disappointed. There are a number of reasons to visit besides the above one of which is the nocturnal tours that start at 7.30pm. It's pretty much guaranteed that you will see small Australian mammals such as the native stick rats (which were once thought to be extinct) and the staff who run it are awesome with so much knowledge it astounds me. You'll see wallabies and the occasional echidna. Can't praise the staff enough. Their knowledge is amazing. Including their information about the indigenous people and original landowners who they treated with respect. You could easily spend a half day here if you bring a picnic. Toilets available and lots of parking. Also wheelchair friendly.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This had to be one of my favourite things to do in Alice. When i'm in town again it is on the must do list. Amazing setting. Must see the bird show too while your there. . Staff friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Excellent way to get a taste of the NT and see many of it Fauna and Flora. Spend the day and soak it all up. Take time to wander and see the little things. We went in Spring and a beautiful display of colors in the wild flowers was amazing."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Did the tour via the Ghan . Very interesting and better than we thought it would be . Interesting to hear the indigenous peoples view on the area. Bird show was great
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Enjoyed the park from the minute I stepped in the gates lovely informative staff all around the park highlights of the park is obviously the free flying birds flight deck area nocturnal area and The informative indigenous Australian Aboriginal talks about various subjects. There is themed areas and the animals. Well worth the price asked to enter the park definitely need half a day or more to properly look around all the areas and tours/talks available at set times.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Nocturnal Tour runs every night at 7:30 pm. It was a great opportunity to see a range of small mammals and native stick rats. Cost is $44 pp but worth it as tour conducted by 2 knowledgeable Desert Park staff members and includes use of red light head torches. The animals we saw most of were the Mala or Rufous Hare Wallaby. Very cute and friendly. A special privilege as they are endangered in the wild. Also got up close to quite a number of echidnas who are normally very shy in the wild.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We found Australia somewhat lacking in wildlife as compared with Southern Africa but here is an opportunity to see indigenous birds and animals up close in natural environment. Even the nocturnal and now quite rare marsupials can be seen courtesy of the dark house. And the bird show, just how do they train wild birds to behave like that. Go and see!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Really enjoyed our visit to Alice Springs and it's Desert Park ..... Spent approx 2 and a half hours walking around. Well worth the time doing so as well.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I highly recommend the night tour. I went with a group of friends and we got to see 7 of the 8 species that live in the park, some of whom are extinct in the wild. We had 2 tour guides, both of whom were very friendly and knowledgeable. It is a bit pricey for the night visit, but it is definitely an experience that you won't get elsewhere."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We hired cycles and had a lovely ride on the excellent cycle track from Alice Springs. Everything in the park has been made to feel so natural it's more like walking through the outback than being in a park. Every hour there was a talk, tour or ranger available to explain about the animals, fauna or fauna. We took advantage of the talk in the kangaroo sanctuary and dingo enclosure. The bird display was great, as was the aboriginal presentation and we were amazed by the knowledge of the keeper in the nocturnal enclosure who gave a guided tour. These are all included in the cost of entry so it's great value for money."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"True, the animals are kept in cages or behind fences, but it is still the best option to spot wildlife in the desert. Tip: go early as most animals are looking for the shade when the sun is at its highest. The movie and the noctural house are both interesting and offering some much needed cool air."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This sanctuary gives a good look at the different types of desert environments and the plants and animals that live in them. Our guide was informative and interesting. Like many such exhibits it's best to go early as the animals tuck themselves away in the heat of the day.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you're in Alice, you're probably there for the wildlife, and no place gives you a more comprehensive look than this. We went in summer so during the daytime the park was (relatively) quiet, but the bird show and bird displays were excellent, as well as the nocturnal animals section. We also went on the nocturnal tour (pre-booking required) at sundown, and that was even better -- an up close, informative look at several species that you don't find on any other continent (we were lucky enough to see all nine, including the echidna, bilby and the extinct-in-the-wild, adorable mala)."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Phenomenal place. Incredible exhibits. Will definitely go again! Their conservation programs are wonderful and I highly recommend the nocturnal tour!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were recommended to go here by the owner of the place we stayed at and it was disappointing,very few animals,the only 2 things that lifted my score were the bird display which was spot on,and the nocturnal house."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great. Helpful staff. Nocturnal house is fantastic. So many icy bubblers to fill up from. Recommended.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had so much fun here! The bird exhibit was absolutely outstanding - don't miss it. These birds are well trained and the park ranger gave amazing information. This is a wonderful place to come and learn about the desert before you go venturing out in it. We learned so much about the plants and animals in the outback and it proved to be useful. Our drive along the Meerenie loop was so much better because we could spot birds and plants.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great morning in the desert with some very good guides. Price was about $25AU for the day. Grounds are very authentic and eco friendly. They are very conscious of the environment and habitat of the animals. You can get up close to Kangaroos, Emu's, Birds, Dingo's, and a nice Nocturnal building and Bird show which is covered. Definitely recommend this activity."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park was designed and built by folks who know and appreciate desert plants and animals. So often these parks are arranged with a centralized building for animals, birds, snakes, etc.; but not here. Plants and trees are in walks around the periphery. As one walks around seeing the various habitats for plants, the aviaries and ""cages"" for the animals are also spread around. A highlight example of this is the ""nocturnal"" buildings. Dark during the day, and light at night, enables us to see the night time creatures in their active states. Australia has so many unique creatures, and many live out in the desert regions; so this is worth seeing."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Attended this exhibit as part of a tour. It is an exhibit of many central Australian animals and birds in a zoo like setting. It has been carefully built and landscaped to look like a desert setting which makes the visit more interesting. They have a well done bird show with various trained birds. The is also a good exhibit of nocturnal animals.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,First arrive early enough to see the bird show at 10am. Plus the early bird gets the worm? For $32 bucks this place is a great buy. Easy walk they even have little electric buggies for people with difficulty walking. Many different bird displayed and a walk in kangaroo area. Cafe onsite. But the bird show was the best part. Watch the movie once you enter to get a ideal what the place is about.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My husband and I spent a good 4 hours this morning looking around the Park. We thought it was extremely good value for money. To make the most of your visit be sure to take advantage of the various shows, you'll be given a programme upon arrival. The bird of prey display at 10 was amazing and we thorough enjoyed Jeremy, the aboriginal ranger talking about bush survival skills at 11. We loved how we could walk into the many bird aviaries and be amongst the birds as they were flying around. Also the roo enclosure. The whole park was in a natural setting, it was amazing. We even came across a superb lizard just sitting on a park bench, which just shows how environmentally balanced the park is. All in all a good day out."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We enjoyed the scenery, flowers, and animals and especially the bird show - very well done and very informative. We also did the nocturnal tour and were fortunate to see all the species that are possible as part of the evening tour. Nocturnal tour includes ""tea"" either before or after the tour. Pam was our guide and she was very knowledgeable. Definitely a unique experience - you would have to assess for your children whether walking in the dark and seeing animals that sometime are scurrying pretty quickly is something they are ready for."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Lovely Park, watch all the shows for best value, use your map so you don't miss anything, particularly the birds"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,very imformative and well organized schedule for a day visit. i am a city person but really enjoyed the day spent here. every area has its own way to attract your attention and keep you educated.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Started with the bird show, loved all the native flowers and trees, nocturnal house was great and the eagle close up adventure was well worth the extra fee. Alll the staff were fantastic"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Housing flora and fauna native to the Alice Springs region, you could spent easily a half day just wandering around. The park is easily accessible to all with well kept pathways that meander throughout the park. Definitely don't miss the birds of prey free flight demonstrations."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This place is well worth a visit. You can do it at your own pace or part take in a guide. The bird show is a must. Many great flora and fauna to see.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Samara I think her name was, was very informative explaining about the reptiles good park great for kids can handle the snakes and lizards lots to see"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Our family had a fantastic time at this venue. All staff, whether it be the front reception, tour guide, the handyman or the cleaner, were engaging and happy to chat with you. The displays were well kept and interesting. The demonstrations, especially the bird show was excellent and enjoyed by the whole family. It was a very warm day but there were ""inside"" activites like the theatre, nocturnal house and an craft table for the children until it was cool enough to go outside again. We cycled out to the park on an (again) excellent bike path. This venue exceeded our expectations and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent a morning here with an aboriginal guide. It was fantastic. This park was built I think 50 years ago and it looks like it's just totally natural. There are several landscapes or zones that it represents. Our guide was phenomenal. I think it was the guide's expertise that made me rate the place so high. We learned about plant life, animals. We saw birds in captivity, and a bird demonstration that was awesome. We went on a very hot day so if you have a choice, pick a less hot day to visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Well worth a visit during your stay in Alice. It's in a lovely spot, with good exhibits especially the myriad bird life of the area. The Nocturnal House is also really great. The animals look well looked after and there is plenty of room to walk around."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We loved the Desert Park and kicked ourselves for not budgeting more time there during our short stay in Alice. We spent about 3 hours, but could easily have been there for 4 or 5. The park had lovely trails, nice enclosures, and a really good nocturnal house. We loved the walk-in aviaries and were glad we got there early for a tour through the kangaroo enclosure. The Birds of Prey show was the highlight of our day and shouldn't be missed. Overall, this is a fantastic Desert Park and a must-see for anyone visiting Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,It is worth a visit. It provides some basic understanding of desert life from couple of it's talk sessions. It also has a birth show which is quite good. It also has a display house for after dark desert creatures. It is quite an educational display.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As locals we visit here often. Such friendly staff that greet you, and a world of exploration awaits (if you can get past the sandpit to start with, my kids can't!) The cafe has several different options mainly for light snacks, and the coffee is good! Our favourites are the dingoes, the bird show, and ultimate is the nocturnal house, one of the biggest I've been in! We've been coming here for a few years, and i discovered an exhibit we've never seen! (Pram doesn't do a lot of off roading) the fish of the finke river system, a large wall based aquarium filled with fish! And of course the perentie along side it. Not the most beautiful of creatures (sorry) NT the bustards have my 3 year olds heart.. Although what some would deem pricey for a day pass, if you get here early and make the most of the guides daily talks and meander through all the park has to offer, it is definitely worth it. If you have brought a bike with you to Alice, do take the bike path from town that leads onto blain street and through to the park. Beautiful wildflowers and serenity await you!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park is 8 or so km west of town and is a world class desert environment park. Me and my gimpy knees arrived about 10 AM. I was surprised by the size of the park and was concerned about walking during heat of day. The staff offered to let me use one of their handicapped scooters for $10 which allowed me to see the entire park in 2 hours. Several aviaries with excellent selection of NT birds, good lizard display, walk inside the kangaroo area allowing you to get with 10 meters of roos. Good look at emus and dingoes as well. At least a dozen different types of desert landscapes presented with size and scale of each allowing you to get a good feel for them. The park sits below a massive, lengthy rock face that is part of MacDonnell Range. If you do nothing else in Alice Springs, don't miss this place."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,At least half a day needs to be spent here-taking a stroll and seeing some animals you may have never heard off-the night area is brilliant and make sure you see the flight show amazing-Loved every minute of it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We really enjoyed this attraction, especially the bird show, and wish we could've spent a little more time there. Travel schedule limited the amount of time we could spend, but could easily see a full day being spent here."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Again worth the visit. Information at the shows really informative. Attend the shows, then visit the park at your leisure, allow 3 - 4 hours for the visit we arrived at 8:30 am left at 2:30 pm great day had."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,well organized and presented tour which we took as part of the Ghan train trip. The wild bird presebtation was a highlight
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Jeremy our guide was very informative and friendly and had a wealth of information relating to how Aboriginal people survived in the central desert. The bird show at the park was also exceptional.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park never fails to impress me. I can't walk very far, ad had LITERALLY barely walked in the front gate when I was greeted by one of the park guides, bringing me out a scooter to save me from having to walk much further. Staff were friendly, helpful, enthusiastic, and the exhibits (a few aviaries, nocturnal house, and something like 7 different habitats) were fantastically put together. In summer the Birds of Prey show is only held in the morning so we missed that, but previous experience tells me the show is well worth coming for. Research the times for presentations during the day before your visit so you can plan. Accessibility for people with mobility issues: Scooters are for hire for $10 for the day, book ahead so you can ensure you get one, especially in tourist season. Almost all exhibits are wheelchair/scooter friendly, and the path around most of the park is bitumen, although for bigger scooters the doors may be slightly narrow. There is a disabled toilet in the Nocturnal House and in the main entrance square. Although again, doors are fairly narrow in the Nocturnal House one so may need assistance. Allow a good few hours for everything. Take lots of water, sunscreen and a hat, but there are fountains everywhere so you can refill your water bottles. LOVED IT!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went to the Desert pak and where blown away by the Great Bird Show, and how the have trained wild birds. Being off the GHAN train we were treated to an extra show where they explained how they trained the birds. An Aboriginal display was also very interesting. It was a very good side trip off our train."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I was not sure what we were going to see but the experience was amazing. The bird show was outstanding full of interesting facts. The remainder of the park was well constructed and extremely interesting. Worth every penny.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"No matter how long you are in Alice Springs you really must find 2 or 3 hours to visit this nature park. Situated just a few miles out of town, it's easy to find with loads of parking and a great cafe when you finish your tour Make sure you follow the guide route as this will get you to see everything from the life bird flying show to the amazing aviaries. Don't miss the nocturnal exhibition where you will see a wonderful array of nighttime creatures. 100% recommend this to you."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The visit to the park was enjoyable, entertaining and very informative. Have been there a few times for different things, but always saw and gained more information. Staff were excellent in customer service, a wealth of information and assisting where needed. If it's a little warm on the day, take your hat and water bottle (full) because you will become immersed in all the exhibits, details and wonder that Central Australia has on show."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Alice Springs Desert Park is a wonderful place to observe the wildlife, talk with the trainers and see the birds and plant life. Be sure to catch the shows and talks with the great personnel, this is a great activity for all ages just be aware of the sun on hot days as it can take it out of you."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very informative particularly for visitors to Australia. The bird show was well presented and entertaining.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This fascinating park is a ten minute drive from town. It features a large area displaying the plants and animals of central Australia and highlighting the interaction of the local people with them. There are lots of exhibits and the usual facilities. We went on a walking tour. Scooters were available for hire if needed. Our guide, Damien, was very enthusiastic and helpful. I particularly remember one amusing fact he passed on. He said Australia has quite a few second best in the world such as the emu, the second biggest flightless bird. But at this park they have the largest carnivorous bat in the world on display, the Ghost Bat."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We chose the night tour because the day had been too hot. We had not realized that we would be walking in an enclosed bush area which ended up being like a night trek and lots of fun to encounter the animals. It also was informative. Made me wish we had the time to come back in the day and see more of this large and lovely place
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This attraction is amazing, it has so many different activities happening you find yourself walking quickly from one to another because you don't want to miss a thing. The free flying bird display was top class how they train these birds is beyond me. The talks and demonstrations we attended were also very good. The food and drink in the cafe was reasonable and fresh."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a wonderful place to start your central Australian holiday. It gives a wonderful insight into the animals and birds that inhabit this harsh environment. You need a few hours to take it all in and wander around the beautifully maintained paths and gardens. It was an extremely hot day when we visited but as it was at the end of the day a lot of the wildlife was active as I would imagine earlier in the day it would have been too hot. Plus I think we were the only people visiting - we didn't see anyone else.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Spending 3 weeks walking the Larapinta trail, I thought I know more or less the place and I can't be surprised much. Turns out I was completely wrong, there is a lot more to the desert life than what you can see without any explanation. The park is not very big and walking it can probably take up to one hour. But the most important experience are the talks that explain the life of wildlife and give an introduction to local aboriginal culture. I spent there about 6 hours and left only because there was no more talks that day. Don't try to do it in rush because you'll miss a lot. If you don't have a car, you can get a bus from hotel or if you miss it, there is public transport from the centre of Alice Springs. It stops about 20 min of a quick walk from the entrance and make sure to cross the main road early or you may miss the left turn."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is really interesting with lots of great talks about Desert Flora and Fauna. It is outdoors in the main so go early or late (early seems to be better to catch more of the talks) and take plenty of water. Their are quite a few aviaries in the park and I have mixed feelings about containing free flying birds. The animals in general don't have the biggest pens and given that they all live natively in the area, it seems a little unnecessary, in my opinion. Finally, I would recommend finding out what talks are on and when and plan your day around them. The park only takes a few hours to get around and so you'll be hanging around or slowly pacing yourself if you want to hear them all."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had a great time at the park. Thoroughly enjoyed everything so close to town and caters for all ages
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a must see for anyone visiting the Alice. The bird display was awesome. Fantastic for children. All staff were lovely, friendly and helpful."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Came for the birdshow and ended up visiting the whole park. Love the nocturnal house display, Easy walk around the park and nice bird displays along the track."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Not even 5 minutes out of Alice and this should be the MUST SEE attraction - if you don't do anything else in Alice, make sure you get in a visit to this Part. We thought we'd spend an hour here but nearly 4 hours later we still had not seen it all. Wonderful walk-through aviaries, birds on nests and totally unfazed by visitors; Doug and his cultural chat that should only have lasted 30 mins but we were still talking an hour later; and OMG!! the nocturnal house was brilliant - face to face with bilbys running around! At $32 per adult (you can come and go through the day), entry is not cheap but I rate it easily the best value in Alice"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Travel in a hurry, it worths a whole day to discover. Recommend the nocturnal house. Don't miss the performance."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My trip to the Desert Park left me wondering if there was any more to see. Despite locals raving about it, it was an expensive day (with two cab rides to get to and from at $25 each) so not worth the money. Bird presentation was really good but I thought there'd be a lot more animals. Didn't get to see the dingoes, couldn't find them in their enclosure and the nocturnal house provided little information about the creatures inside."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Have been here 3 times now from 1995 to 2016 and found it most enjoyable every time. The plantings change with the seasons as they do in the wild so there is always a different experience on each visit. One day is never enough and we find ourselves heading for the gate at closing time with still more to see. The raptor show featuring some of Australia's best winged hunters is not to be missed.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were very surprised at what we saw in this park it wasn't cheap but as we walked around at took in all the the different enclosures we loved it we also sat in on a demonstration by one of the Rangers he was an indigenous man and his story telling was fantastic. I don't normally spend money on this type of stuff but I am very glad we did, we even left for lunch and came back"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very good desert park experience and outside of visiting the ranges nearby, the must do Alice Springs experience. A large, natural setting with local animals and very diverse local flora. A great nocturnal house, much bigger than most I've come across, and a must see Birds of Prey show."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We are so glad we chose to visit Desert Park. We had a guide. Doug did an outstanding job taking us around, describing things that were not signed, and adding his own personal history to the tour. The bird show was excellent."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A must see attraction which is world class! Excellent walking tracks give access to many wildlife displays. These are excellent facilities and you could spend hours observing the wild life and contrasting vegetation. The nocturnal house is world class! A very memorable experience, ideal for Seniors!!!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great way to see in a natural setting the unique Australian desert fauna. Good interactive opportunities with a bird of prey show, as well as info session throughout the day. The displays and enclosures are well designed for little people as well adults and offer a walk around experience, so remember your hat and water!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I just loved the Desert Park! It is well set out with good paths traversing each of the landscape areas. I learnt so much and saw so much. The bird show, in particular, was outstanding. Thank you for this wonderful space!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My partner and I visited the desert park on the advice of a friend. This place is amazing It starts of with a video or a film that goes for about forty minutes it explained all about the central Australian habitat after that you then walk through all the enclosures with the animals and the birds of the region. The best part of the park was the bird show where a collection of well trained birds are show cased and while they are flying around they are giving you a detailed description of the birds and there habits. This would have to be one of the best wildlife parks I have visited
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I wasn't keen to go initially as I though 'another walk in the park'...this park is a MUST experience in Alice Springs! We did visit in spring and all plants and birds were active, beautiful and full of energy. Not sure how it may be during hot summer days but I believe even then one can enjoy the many hidden treasures. You don't want to kiss the birds show- the people are so amazingly knowledgeable and the birds are just another unique experience. We learnt a lot from the show. Everything is very, very entertaining and well looked after, with interesting bits of information at every step. The Indigenous ranger have such an insightful talk on the use of plants by the aboriginal people for medical purposes. Impressive!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a great attraction. knowledgeable guides and a great variety of displays. The cafe is good as well. Allow at least a half day and there is a fair bit of walking.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I went on this trip to fill in time. I was greatly impressed with the attraction, presentation and greatly informed on the desert plants, fauna and bird life. This is truly a wonderful environmental experience. The bird show is amazing and thrilled the spectators. A wonderful day and a great way to appreciate the Australian desert environment. I would love to come back again to see this park. You can do a lot of walking but it is mainly flat land and plenty of places to rest on the way."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My husband and I took a leisurely ride along the bike path to the Desert park and enjoyed a cool drink at the cafe. We enjoyed the beautiful surroundings the wild life and the bird show. The aviary is lovely . i could sit an watch the birds for hours
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My husband and I visited the Desert park around ten years ago and wanted to share the experience with our children. We arrived at the desert park around lunch time and watched the movie which was great but a little above our four and six year olds. The feature of the desert park to me were the ranger sessions. I learned so much from them particularly in the nocturnal area, at the dingoes and the bird show. The bird show was amazing and very informative however I was disappointed my favourite animal, the wedge tailed eagle, wasn't part of the bird show. If you're going to go, arrive early to make the most of all the ranger sessions/talks and take hats, water and sunscreen."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My wife and I live in Alice and this is one of our favourite places to spend an afternoon. Walking amongst the trees, watching all the birds and stopping by to see the resident dingoes...it doesn't get any better."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We were disappointed that there was not more to do and see at the park. We were surprised to find that the the entry fee did not include all shows but one had to pay more. The best feature was the movie at the beginning and the spectacular view as the movie finished.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We were very pleasantly surprised by the desert park. The bird show was amazing and the presentation by Jeremy about aboriginal tools and culture was funny and informative. We spent 5 hours there and could have stayed a lot longer. I would have liked more information on the flora but the area is easy to negotiate and there is plenty to see. Make sure you watch the movie.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We got more than we expected from our visit to the desert park. If you're at all interested in the land you're visiting, this is a must-do. You'll see everything with different eyes after this tour. Recommended."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Could stay all day. Excellent bird show. The aboriginal talk from Jeremy was great. He really explained their culture very well and entertaining. Kiosk available but advise you go for the burgers! Wish I had more time to explore this wonderful place.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was such a good place to visit and so, so interesting. We learnt a lot about desert life and the animals that inhabit this fascinating environment. The reception staff were very helpful and light-hearted. The guides were very knowledgable, especially Matt. We really enjoyed the bird display - totally amazing! Definitely 3 hours well spent."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had hopes of entering but with 4 adults @ $32 a head, we got as far as the entry and the gift shop. A family of 4, 2A 2C could enter for $87 so we said we are three seniors and one adult, we can manage the $87 but we were refused. 2 of our party were overseas seniors but their seniors cards from their country were not recognised either....do these people WANT to make money and get people thru the door or not? They could have made $87 but chose not to. We walked."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park is beautifully laid out on sandy, gravel paths. There are scheduled talks on indigenous culture, flora and fauna throughout the day. The highlight for us were the bird enclosures. Fascinating to be so close to some of the most beautiful avian residents of the NT. The Rangers were knowledgeable and friendly. Plenty of seating and interpretive notes. The cafe was basic but filled a need. It was a pleasure to meet so many young indigenous people smiling and happy."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had a wonderful day at Desert Park with our guide Damien. A very informative guide who also had a sense of humour. The free flight bird show was excellent and informative whilst allowing many photo opportunities. Although hot there was plenty of shade and water stops. The lunch was excellent with a wide choice catering for all dietary requirements. The little cafe was pleasant and clean and a great spot to buy a cool drink or ice cream. The souvenir shop was well stocked with lovely stafff
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is one of our favorite places to visit in Australia. A perfect place to see Aust wildlife in as natural setting as possible. Staff are super friendly and knowledgeable. Everything well maintained and easy to get around. An early start was worth getting up early for. It meant that there were less people and more active animals.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We really enjoyed everything, well designed not overwhelming made for a relaxing experience. Highlight was the aboriginal talk from Jeremy really interesting, informative kids enjoyed this the most as well. The cafe was very affordable and good food too."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's like a zoo only much better. Be sure to watch the 15 minute movie at the entrance and stay til the end for a surprise. We missed the bird show, but went to the presentation on surviving in the desert given by Damien. It was really interesting and entertaining. There are so many animals to see, large and small. You even get to walk through the kangaroo enclosure and be right next to them. There are also emus and dingos. It gets really hot so try to go early. They opened at 7:30 the day we went."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Easily a Eco- world leader introducing strange and wonderful habitat and animals in the Australian desert. Huge habitat cages allow you to enter for free movement and ample story boards describe which animals are living there. Be sure to catch the Birds in Free Flight module, and learn about bush tucker from Aboriginal ranger. A very well stocked gift shop and cafe, too."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We loved the bird show (even a trained magpie), very well presented. The desert survival / bush food talk was fantastic - learnt so much about the way indigenous gathered food and how people's interacted with each other. Nocturnal house was great, walking in the dark we saw quite a few things we had not seen before)."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is absolutely great! The walks are simple but refreshing and relaxing, allowing you to get a sense of the diversity of semi-arid vegetation. With all the rain, the flowers were absolutely blooming and it was really beautiful! The aviaries were stunning, with gorgeous birds, and the nocturnal house is great, allowing you to see critters that you are unlikely to ever see, particularly during the day. The food at the cafe was well priced and tasty. All in all, a great day out!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"So much to see at this park, the shows are really interesting and the gardens and grounds are immaculately maintained."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were part of a group from the Ghan Expedition, so treated to a range of guided activities prearranged by Great Southern Rail. After walking a short distance through the attractive setting of the park, we sat to watch the Flying Bird Show. Those of us who have seen a similar show at Healesville Sanctuary, near Melbourne, had a good idea of what to expect. Different birds are released from a hidden enclosure at specific times and fly right to the presenter. It's fascinating to watch birds - such as eagles, a bustard, a magpie, kites and an owl - interact with the presenter. An aboriginal man then told us how to make different implements. He was both amusing and clever. For lunch, staff from the Ghan had prepared a delicious array of salads featuring local ingredients and cold meats, plus lemon pie. We ate outside in the area of Madigans Restaurant. We then watched a movie in the theatre before having a Wander through the Woodland. Next was a tour of the nocturnal house, and the desert rivers discovery walk. I loved seeing the tiny animals that only come out at night. Explanations from our guides were really interesting. In my view, a day spent at the Desert Park is a must when you are in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is certainly a ""must see"" destination for the Alice Springs visitor who has any sensitivity to the desert environment, it's vegitation and wild life. An early morning visit in the cool of the day is recommended in the late spring and summer months when the sun and heat of the day can be debilitating if not dangerous to those not familiar with this environment."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I LOVED this place. If you love animals and birds, this place is fabulous. We took our time walking around clockwise to time ourselves with the Bird Show in the afternoon. I've been to the Healesville one so I was expecting something similar. The host was very informative and you really got a sense of the birds personality. However, we didn't have a Buzzard or Wedge-tail Eagle in our show. The kids were some what disappointed as the advertisements are everywhere but perhaps they were having an off day or get rested on some?? The birds we did see were magpie, 2x owls, 2x kits, a hobby, bush stone-curlew. And they were all exceptional!! Very cool. Also need to mention the Nocturnal House was excellent! Loved every minute I was in there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent a couple of hours walking around the park and really enjoyed it. It is not all that cheap for what you get, but this is compensated for by the knowledge that some of the money goes towards helping the survival of endangered species. There quite a few ""ranger talks"" and these definitely make the visit worthwhile, so look these up before you go and time your visit to do as manly of these as possible. My advice is go and enjoy it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I'm not a fan of zoos or places that incarcerate animals, but the accommodation at the Desert Park seems reasonable, clean and well kept. We paid extra for an encounter with a wedgetail eagle, which was interesting, although it didn't seem to like my partner much (although she's the bird fan). The photographs taken as part of the experience clearly showed our discomfort in being close (both us and the eagle). The eagle's keeper was knowledgeable and seemed committed to the animals welfare, and because the eagle was unable to fly due to an injury early in life, the Park provides the eagle with a reasonable life. We also toured the other sections of the park: dingo, kangaroos, nocturnal animals, birds and so on. We also went around the nocturnal section with a guide, and saw some animals that weren't around the first time. Again, the guide was knowledgable about the animals. We finished with the bird encounter, which allowed us to see a number of birds in flight, up close. For that reason, it is worth a visit. However, I have a philosophical objection to training animals to perform party tricks. In summary, not a bad place to visit, but if you take the trouble, you can see a number of the animals in the wild, on their terms."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This park offers an amazing window into animal life in the desert. It also highlights different areas in the desert and what each one can provide for animals and humans alike. I really enjoyed the Bird Show and there were lots of other interesting talks to attend at other ares in the park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a complete surprise... Heaps to learn and see. A little off-putting at first with a $32 entry fee, but once you get over that there is some great stuff to learn and see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"While it was a wedding that initially got us to this location, there is plenty of things to see and do here. An absolute must is the Bird Ampitheatre as I was generally surprised at how the handlers/trainers managed to coerce all these different styles of birds out in a ""free"" environment given any time they could simply fly away - an amazing show. Other exhibits there are also worth checking out"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a must do when visiting Alice. We were there mid September, weather was perfect for sightseeing. You could spend as much time as you would like at the Park. We also were lucky to be in Alice in the Park for their Festival of Light event. Well worth seeing. Overall very impressed with the Park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I only spent the morning here but you can spend the entire day if you can tolerate the heat. They have a very good collection of birds- lots and lots of photo opps. There is a nocturnal animal building which is really neat to see. It is pretty dark in there. I am not sure if you are able to use flash here. I did not use flash out of respect for the creatures- its not natural. Since it is Spring time, the wildflowers are blooming which made the walk quite pleasant. If you are in Alice Springs, this place has to be on your places to visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Visiting the desert park is an experience that highly increases your knowledge about the central desert environment, the flora and the fauna and the Aboriginal local culture of the Arrente people. I am extremely happy I spent a whole day in the park, attending all the shows and talking of the amazing, outstanding guides working there!!! Thank you for all the information you all guys provide the visitors with! Highly recommended to everybody, youngest and adults!! Silvia"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Excellent facilities and such different experiences in each region of the desert. Wished we had longer to experience this amazing site.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Get a taxi from central Alice to the Desert Park. Entry fee is $52 Take your own food and drink and be prepared to spend all day there. Make sure you go to all the shows, the bird show is spectacular and the guided tour around the nocturnal house. Use the map to make sure you do all the walks and a must- look at all the aviaries."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"There is a lot of walking around here and for older people,this could be very tiring. Especially if it's hot. Like it was the day I went. Take plenty of water. Flight show was good."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It was awesome to see the variety of animals on display. The bird show was almost worth the admission price on its own, the bicturnal house is excellent and the bird life is extensive. Some more mature sign board with a bit more info could be good but overall, a reasonable adventure."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great place to visit - lots of birds (both in the wild and in aviaries) and some animals, most notably Kangaroos which do come very close to you. Nocturnal house is excellent as is the bird show."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a wonderful introduction into the flora and fauna of the area. My guide was knowledgeable and forthcoming taking us around showing us the different animal species of the area. They had a bird show, excellent. It is a man made park with easy walking trails. The surrounding scenery was magnificent. I highly recommend."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This park is very informative and the grounds and surrounds are just beautiful. Kids under 5 are free and there is enough going on to keep them occupied. There is a really cool nocturnal animal section that our nearly 4 year old loved.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park gives you a close up look at the different desert environments. Easy walking paths, shelters from the sun, cool drinking stations and good food at the Coolamon Cafe. Good for all ages but if you are a bird lover you will be able to get up close and personal with many of the local feathered friends. Nocturnal house was spectacular. Flying bird show was very informative about many of our native birds. As we are bird lovers it wasn't a problem spending 4 hours here getting fantastic photos of birds, lizards etc."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We only had an hour at the park as part of our tour so chose to go to see the nocturnal animals. It was fabulous - much bigger than we expected with lots of wildlife - snakes , spider, lizards, rats, bilbies. It was fun trying to spot them as a lot of them have good camouflage. Will definitely return to the park next time we are in Alice Springs to see the rest of the attractions here and the nocturnal animals again."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Desert Park isxa great little zoo. The nature show in particular is terrific with beautifully trained birds and animals that gives insight into life in the desert. It also has lovely walks through different environments and interesting talks by local experts.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Alice Springs Desert Park was truly amazing. If you're going to do a tour of The Red Centre you should start at The Alice and visit the park to give yourself a grounding in how it all fits together. The bird show on its own is worth the admission. Take your time and make a day of it. Join in as many of the 'activities' as you can. Each one is a learning experience. And the grounds are so well laid out that get the feeling of being alone in the natural environment.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Beautiful, tranquil it makes you feel part of the outback. Ideal for long hikes or just to take time out from life."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Alice Springs desert park is set out well with a good scale and range of desert fauna all easy to access and see. Great bird show and fantastic range of birds o lots of enclosures, many you can walk through. The only downside was the cafe: I would recommend skipping it and lunching or snacking elsewhere."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a surprise. Well laid out, many native plants and animals. Ensure you have time to look through the Nocturnal Complex. Cafe attached."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a must best day we had, the free flight bird show is of International standard a must see. They have dingo and lots of birds and animals in there natural surrounds. We also went to a few informative talks about bush plants for food and medicine EXCELLANT !!!!!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was my first time at the Desert Park as it did not exist when I was last in Alice Springs. I particularly loved the bird show, and that is not be missed. All very clever with the birds re acting to the speaker's voice and gestures. Of course they were fed! There are other attractions too, such as the nocturnal pavilion. The wild flowers were coming out in spring and the Desert Park is not to be missed in Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Amazing rainy day in Alice but still lovely day at Desert Park - last days of bird art show, also - I'm broke - laughing"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great. Trip advisor is a PIA demanding that I woffe on when I have no desire to do so. They need to accept what people are prepared to do and not be so forcefull.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"what a wonderful assett to Alice Springs. only a short distance out of town and we spent all day going to various events around the park, and the cinema was excellent. staff fantastic, beautiful and clean, well kept, fantastic flaura and fauna. cant rate it high enough."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This Desert Park venue is amazing. As pensioners the cost of admission was $25:50 each. This was absolute value for money. Happy, professional staff, premises are very clean and beautifully presented. The presentations at each enclosure were very, very good. We had a fabulous day. Don't wear your sunnies into the nocturnal enclosure ( as I did), as visibility is poor then."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We arrived early and had a lovely few hours. We particularly enjoyed the talk by the ranger at the red kangaroo enclosure. The world famous bird show was fabulous. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Plenty more to do and see if you had longer. Would highly recommend.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the Desert Park from early morning until well after lunch (in the excellent cafe), then we returned at night for the wonderful Nocturnal Tour. Dedicated staff, always available and ready to assist with their comprehensive knowledge of the flora and fauna of central Australia"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We didn't know what to expect with this tourist park and were pleasantly surprised. People are free to wander around and enter the enclosures included in the walk to view the local wildlife. The centre also offers talks at certain times of the day to inform visitors of the habits of the local wildlife. Very interesting.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I thought the Desert Park was fabulous, the bird show was great and I also attended the Aboriginal foods talk which was excellent. Customer service was brilliant and I would happily recommend a visit"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Arrived after lunch but when we saw how much was on offer, we came back early the next day. Did all the guided tours, which are all timed so you can get to everything. The Birds of Prey show was spectacular, as was the Eagle Encounter. Well worth the extra money to see that. The Nocturnal House is seriously huge, with an amazing array of creatures to see. We had the best day, and definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Dprings Desert Park is 7km out of Alice Springs, but can be easily reached by car, bus or cycle. It's $32 per person and well worth it. The park is beautifully set out with a variety of walks through different habitats The bird exhibits are wonderful and there is plenty of room for the birds to fly around. The birds are easy to identify from the signage There are birds of prey shows and a nocturnal house and a free audio tour. The plants lining the walls are pretty and change between habitats. I wish I could have stayed longer"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Visited the Desert Park in August 2016. Mainly birds in large enclosures spread out around the park so involves some walking. The nocturnal house is absolutely fantastic and the guide who gave a talk was very informative and interesting. It is an absolute shame so many of the creatures in there are now so rare in the wild. The guide who gave a talk on the dingoes there was also very good and happy to answer questions. The flying display was, however, the best part of the whole visit. How they got the birds to turn up and perform as needed was something else and the lady who gave the talk was very entertaining, informative and had a real rapport with the birds. Definitely recommended!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the Park at the end of our stay at Uluru and in the MacDonnell ranges. During our many walks we haven't seen much animals: here we could see them, kangaroos, emus, reptiles and in particular, many colorful birds. The park is very nicely arranged, there is a show with large birds. The visitors centre has a shop with a very good collection of aboriginal art."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Had a wonderful day at the dessert park. They give a wrist band , so that you can leave and come back later in the day. The Aboriginal lady who was doing a bush tucker etc presentation was very informative and had the crowds attention with her stories. Well done to her."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Wasn't sure what to expect here but throughly enjoyed the three hours we had here. A Coach tour of 34 pax, we were guided through the park and our guide explained a lot about the aboriginal culture which was very interesting. The bird show at the end was amazing as the birds came in right on Que. Amazingly well trained. Great job. Highly recommend a visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A very pleasant way to see many of the indigenous plants, animals and birds all in one location. The access around the park is easy and wheelchair/Pram friendly, and the aviaries with all the birds were especially nice, as some species are difficult to see in the wild! Very enjoyable."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Visited here on a whim while driving through. Great staff. Learnt so much about the kangaroos and different birds. Loved the nocturnal house! Amazing seeing the great brown snake come fave to face with my boyfriend through the glass!!! A fabulous day out!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great for all ages, accessible for all & they always have events & programs running. Great helpful & friendly staff. Don't miss the bird show!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Would recommend a few hours here to see all the presentations and the animals. Lots of walking but great tracks to walk on. Talks given and bird display interesting
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A fantastic park to visit to see wild flowers in bloom, native wildlife, birds, fish and reptiles. Staff very friendly and happy to answer questions about the animals and park. A great bird show. A great place for couples or families to spend a few hours"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"before we go there, we have low expecting of the park. thinking probably a few emu, kangaroo and birds only. it is surprise that there are so many animals there. And it can be dangerous in small bush in the desert. My wife is scared and excited. good to know."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Spent a great afternoon looking around the Desert Park. It is well set out, especially if you like birds. The bird of prey was interesting loved the magpie. The young girl was great with the birds or raptors. Would have liked to have seen an eagle but it was still good. The dingos, kangaroos, emus were easily seen. Very clean and well set out. A good way to spend an afternoon."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This place is great kids enjoyed it especially the feeding in the nocturnal room , great display of dessert animal's"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a family trip with grandma, children and grandkids. Great place to learn and explore about central Australia for all ages!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs Desert Park........A great place to visit. Great guides, great food, awesome views and information, great staff. A beautiful and historical place. Put it on your ""have to visit"" list."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great park which has been well laid out, and there are lots of exhibits which give the visitor a good insight into local flora and fauna. Having said that, the park is a must see for any bird fans, and I would highly recommend to plan your visit to coincide with the ""Free Flying Bird Show"" - which are currently shown at 10.00am and 3.30pm. The Nocturnal House is world class and must not be missed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a great introduction to the amazing animals of the red centre. You could easily spend most of the day there. If at all possible, don't miss the free flying bird show which is at 10 am and 3 pm. (check times for your dates) We did the ranger talk on bush tucker which was a fantastic insight into Aboriginal skills for living and surviving in the desert. There is a list of times for talks and presentations throughout the day, but best to get there early so you can choose which ones to go to as they generally only happen once a day. There are plenty of enclosures and exhibitions to see as well."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this park, which gives visitors a chance to meet many of the fascinating creatures in Australia's Red Center. We didn't have any free evenings for the night tour, which we heard is fabulous, but the park is amazing during the day as well. Tip: go early in the morning and head for the kangaroos first."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a great day. I think to have an outstanding experience you need to do the amazing talks. Without them it wouldn't be the same. Interesting, professional and passionate rangers. We arrived at 9am in time for the 9.15am marsupial talk then the 10 tree flying bird show then the 11 aboriginal survival in the desert A quick lunch then 12.30pm 20min movie 1 desert animals nocturnal house then 1.45 plant medicines With visits in between to all the aviaries, gardens, etc If you just dropped in for an hour or so it wouldn't be the same. Allow most of the day"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a fantastic experience which should be experienced by all visitors to the Alice. Unfortunately our visit was marred by a very officious person who, despite my obvious age, refused to admit me for seniors price because I had left my seniors card in the car some way from the entrance. Since I have a pacemaker, I was reluctant to go all the way back for the card so had to pay full price."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Had heard good things about the desert park however I must say it was a bit of a let down. It is a good 'australian experience' for tourists to get the chance to see the wildlife in an outback scene but to be honest we had seen most of the animals in the park on the drive there in the wild anyway (which is far more exciting!). The indoor reptile park was the most interesting part of the park as some of the animals in the outdoor enclosures were looking a bit sorry for themselves! There are plenty of walk-in aviaries, however, so it's the perfect place for bird-lovers! I"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a ""not to miss"" experience if you are in Alice Springs. Get there in time for the AMAZING bird show (10am ish) The park is worth going to just for this show. It is an outdoor park, with easy walking trails to the exhibits. Beautiful views of the mountains . The nocturnal exhibit is also really fantastic. We also went to the aboriginal talk which was interesting Sadly we had to leave at about 1pm, we would have stayed longer if we could have Highly recomment."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Beautiful weather, great park, friendly staff. We first visited the Desert Park 11 years ago and loved it then. Did not disappoint on our return visit. It was great to see it after some rain, as it had been really dry prior to our first visit. The changes in the layout and the additional avaries and the dingo exhibit were great to see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We thought we'd spend an hour or so here, but after five hours still wanted to see more. So much to see and learn, especially the free flying bird show, the Aboriginal bush tucker presentation and guided walk through the Nocturnal House. Each guide was well informed, entertaining, humorous and friendly. We also loved the film about the origins and development of the Red Centre. The final moments when 'all is revealed' were magic."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Nice place. Simple, not much in terms of fringes. Bathroom is bare, but clean; for us this is what mattered. Price was fair, considering how expensive it is to travel around this area (Mereenie Loop or Red centre way)."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We enjoyed our visit to the desert park. We learnt so much! You must do the scheduled talks with the Rangers to get the best value.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Love taking the children to desert park, always have an enjoyable time and children love the birds. Have been with other families and on our own always have a lovely time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Was nice enough but it's mostly birds. The bird show is pretty good have to say, they are well trained and the staff know their stuff. There wasn't a lot in the way of other animals. Just a couple of emus, dingos and Roos. But if you haven't seen them before by all means it would be a good experience. Think there are more shows on during the week so would recommend a week day trip to get the most out of it. Bird waters dream if that's what your into 😉"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We all had an awesome and informative Day. We all will sleep well tonight. Fantastic Job to all at the Park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert Park only unites out of Alice Springs is a place you should not miss! Plenty of parking, a kiosk and a very impressive Information and Souvenir Centre. We were given a map and shown the well defined path to take by a friendly staff member. Many of the trees were labelled and the many aviaries were a wonder. The birds we saw were amazing. We made our way around the park even encountering an emu! The Nocturnal House opened a whole new vista of the life of the Red Centre-billies, malas and Spinifex snakes and many more! Our last port of call was the Bird Display. It was brilliant to see our wild birds such as Brown Kites, magpies and close up. The Ranger who gave the display was very informative and many of the audience from overseas were captivated and awed! I can thoroughly recommend the Desert Park as a must when visiting Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I would definitely recommend this stop to anyone who has never been to the Outback before. It's a fantastic introduction to the different plants and animals you will be seeing as you drive and hike. The park is sort of like a spread-out zoo that that walks you through the different ecosystems found in the Outback and includes pens and aviaries of the animals and birds typically seen in each. I took pictures of many of the little animal description signs to refer to later on our trip and was glad I did! It's always more fun when you can put a name to that odd tree you find or birdsong you hear. The park is rather large, so expect to do quite a bit of walking, but the paths are very well-maintained and level. Also, 95% of the park is outdoors, so make sure to take proper precautions against the sun. If you love animals and nature, this could be a half-day stop, easily."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent 5 1/2 hours there exploring, tasting bush tucker and listening to informative talks about the animals and also the Aboriginal heritage. I would recommend this place whole heartedly. It would be a shame to not visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great bird show and lots of birds in and out of the enclosures. There is also a great nocturnal house with bibles, owls, snakes etc"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Our family of 4 visited in July and had a great day. Starting with the morning free flying bird show, we then moved on to take ourselves through the nocturnal house and a couple of the other zones. We paid the extra $ and did the eagle encounter which I would highly recommend. It's not often you will get the chance to be up close to the magnificent wedge tail eagle so take it if you can. We finished off with a late lunch in the cafe which worked well. Take some snacks and water with you, especially with kids as it is pretty much a full day if you want to walk through all the areas. Well worth a visit if you are in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Attractively landscaped with endemic plants, the Alice Springs Desert Park not only showcases local arid flora and fauna but attracts local fauna, especially birds. Add the backdrop of the spectacular McDonnell Ranges and the exceptionally friendly welcome by staff and I was ready for a good experience and wasn't disappointed. The bird show should not be missed and the small walk through aviary is a delight. That said, don't expect something as extensive as Taronga Zoo or exotic animals. The Alice Springs Desert Park is much smaller in scale and scope and fulfils well its niche market."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place. The infrastructure is fabulous and wheelchair friendly. The information sessions are very well done and informative. Could easily spend 2 days. Take your own lunch the cafe is pretty ordinary
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We spent a most enjoyable few hours exploring the Desert Park. The bird aviaries and birds are great and we also found the examples of different desert landscapes and plants really interesting. A most informative experience.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We went to the Park fairly early in the morning and had to catch a plane around midday. We soon discovered that we did not have enough time to do justice to this place. It provides a great introduction/conclusion to the Red Centre's environments and wildlife. It is well laid out with informative signs and clear pathways. The free-flight show was excellent. You must visit this Park of you are visiting Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"An outstanding park with excellent animal displays. The surrounding red hills in backdrop make for a refreshing experience. The demonstration of the hawk training was outstanding, and all the staff were friendly and obviously proud of their jobs, as they should be. They exuded knowledge of the habitat and vegetation, and we really enjoyed the experience."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a great and interesting place to visit, would definitely go back as we missed the night tour. What a lovely well set out environment for all the animals and lots of interesting information about them all. Staff are very friendly and well knowledges. We'll be back for sure"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We found out that we had some time to kill while in Alice Springs. so decided to visit the park. We were pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. The staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable. Although the entry fee was a bit expensive, we availed ourselves of the free bird show at the end of the day. The extra cost of the eagle show was way too much."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Firstly, we visited in October and it was very hot, around 36/37 degrees. If that is the time of year you plan to visit, go as early as possible to avoid the worst of it. It's open from 8:30am. We started our visit by going into the little cinema to watch a video presentation about how the desert was formed. It was interesting but if you have small children, it might not hold their interest for too long. If you're not really interested in that type of thing and just want to see what's there now, you can just skip it. The animal exhibits are set out along pathways that wind through desert vegetation (similar to the Territory Wildlife Park, in Darwin). There are aviaries that allow you to get close to and good views of many of the smaller bird species of the area. The free flight bird show was good but in all honesty, it's very similar to the ones at Taronga Zoo or Healesville Sanctuary, just with a different backdrop. The night house was my favourite (and not just for the air conditioning) It was good to get to see many of the creatures that hide during the day. Included some endangered species, such as the mala, which I was very excited to see and there were plenty of reptiles on display as well. We only managed a couple of hours before the heat became too much but we were glad we visited. Most of it is outside, so hats, sunscreen and water are a MUST!! They also offer after dark tours that allow you to see some of the animals at night but unfortunately, we were there over a weekend, when that tour doesn't run. It's only a few minutes out of Alice Springs, definitely worth a visit, especially if you don't have time to do much exploring."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,As an Alice Springs resident I have been to the Desert Park on numerous occasions. This time my family was visiting from overseas and as we only had a short time in Alice Springs I knew the Desert Park would be the perfect place to take them. As always it did not disappoint. The Free Flying Bird Show was excellent. It is my favourite part of any visit to the Desert Park. The Aboriginals living in the desert talk was also excellent and although I had attended it before it was still interesting. The park guide that does this talk is great. Love the Nocturnal House. A half-day at the Desert Park is vital during any visit to Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Central Australia on show at just one address. The Desert Park showcases the birds, animals and reptiles and their environments where a days walking takes you to places that would normally take weeks of traveling to see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to see some of Central Australia's wildlife and flora without going too far outback. Suitable for all ages. Highlight is the Bird of Prey display but you must book ahead.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went to Desert Park on a Sunday when we wanted to relax and not wake too early. It was a very pleasant day - lots of animals around, and lots of interesting presentations that one can go to in between just seeing the sights."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great for walking, biking and camping. They have hill to top of peaks that give you amazing views of the outback. Wild kangaroos all over the place, highly recommended if a lover of the outdoors."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Our family of 5 really enjoyed our day and night at the Desert Park. We arrived early and were glad that we did, because you get the most out of the day if you go to the ranger talks, and most only run once each. We all enjoyed the bird show in the amphitheatre and did the eagle encounter which we would also recommend. Rory the eagle was very engaging and obviously had a great rapport with his keeper James. Anne was also a fabulous presenter with great energy. We all learnt a lot. We brought our own lunch and ate at one of the many tables We returned that evening for the nocturnal walk which we all enjoyed - great to see a bilby out of an enclosure! Greg was a very knowledgeable guide and the kids enjoyed the refreshments at the end. Buying the day and night tickets as a package made it affordable, and good to support such a great attraction."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great place to see plants and native animals and birds. The displays are very well planned and provide easy access for visitors. The bird display was fantastic and brief talks about dingoes and emus of good value. The nocturnal tour was wonderful with us seeing bandicoots, bilbys, betongs, echidnas and malas. Coffee and cake was a great way to finish off too. Tour guides were an asset and their knowledge and experience evident."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Of all the wild animals I expected to see and ex work colleague from 2500kms away was not one! We grabbed Chelsea, from the bird show, and took a photo together. Chelsea an the birds had put on an exciting show, it may have even made me appreciate the killer swooping magpie a little! My other favourite was the thorny devil. I almost missed the display in the nocturnal centre but lucky for me I turned and there it was, 3 of the thorny Devils hanging out, walking and just being thorny. There were some lovely walks and lots to see. I didn't realise there were so many different activities going on through the day and that it was a 2 day ticket! Great place for all ages and with access to motor scooter, all abilities too."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Lovely place to have a wander & learn about local flora & fauna. We thought some of the cages for the animals were a bit too small. Considering how large the area was, would have been easy to add more space for the animals to roam, especially the dingos."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park is well organized, highly educational and displays both, nature and animals, in a well condensed, understandable fashion. Birds can be seen in enclosements and nature - marvellous experience. Doug presenting the Aboriginal culture was just awesome - cultural entertainment at its best! Making foreigners like us understand the deep rooted culture and organization easier - it is all about organization and care about what is your business (and let others care about the rest). We also did the night nocturnal tour - another unique and awesome experience."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The ADP was a good take. The animals appeared to be well attended and the staff knowledgeable. Get there at opening to see as many presentations as possible or you will just wonder through and miss the good information provided by staff. Pack a lunch and eat it at the cafe outdoor tables. We did and it worked out quite well. The on site restaurant is over priced!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a wildlife / botanical / cultural experience. We spent over 4 hours there. Highlights were the bird show, Aboriginal life in the desert and nocturnal house. Some of the guides were Aboriginal and offered some real insights into their culture and the wildlife. This is a must see in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We arrived around 10am to ""wander around for a couple of hours"". About 6 hours later we finally left. There was just so much to see. The bird exhibition was great. All the birds are free flying but come on cue to give demonstrations of how they survive in the wild.Aboriginal culture presentations and so much more. Another ""must see"" if you're in this area."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Had a great day and enjoyed the talks thoroughly. Loved the Bird Show. We felt the Night Tour was a bit pricey and we were disappointed that we didn't see more animals.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a very well designed park, very well cared for animals and gardens, very friendly staff, reasonable entry fee and plenty to see and easy access to the busy guided tours and information sessions throughout the day. We spent about 5 or so hours there. It was a freezing cold day and ending it in the nice warm cinema there was a good way to finish. Their cafe is rubbish, bring sandwiches. It appeared to be disability friendly and you can hire a little buggy for $10 if walking is not your strong point."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My grandaughter (6) was leaving Alice for Darwin and wanted one more visit to her favourite place! The nocturnal house is top of her list. No matter how many times, she loves it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This place was expensive and just ok. Not really that much to look at. Lots of bird life and lots of talks if you can manage to be at each one. We found it a bit boring.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Cannot commend this place enough. Set in the backdrop of alice springs desert and the mac donnell range- this experience was both educational and highly enjoyable. You can see a wide variety of the local flora and fauna. They describe the modern day challenges we face from human development and the impact it has upon the Australian natural environment. Make sure to watch the bird show. One of the best things ive ever seen. Worth every penny!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is the attraction in Alice springs. It is wheelchair friendly with regular shaded rest stops. It wonderful for all ages. The highlight of the day was the bird show, the tour guide Bronte was fabulous, knowledgable, friendly and entertaining. She possibly has the best office and job in Australia. Make sure you set aside enough time to see everything it can be a day long tour or rushed through in 3 hours. Don't miss the the movie show."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Although a small nature park, you can spend all day here. There are a lot of different ecological areas: sand country, woodland & desert rivers. These are natural ecologies which develop naturally alongside the McDonnell Ranges opposite it. There are dingoes, the nocturnal house, salt pans, emus, walk-in aviaries, red kangaroos, etc. All have guide talks going from 8:39am to 4:00pm. Not to be missed is the demonstration of local birds in the amphitheatre at 3:30. Birds of prey fly into the handler in the open air and zoom around the audience, all outside of an aviary. Definitely a casual way to see the local ecological areas, plants and animals using flat paths and close-by café and toilets."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a great attraction to learn about indigenous lifestyle, native animals and to see the reptiles. The bird show is fantastic and the kids were able to go and ask questions of the handler... Really impressive. The presentation on the indigenous tools and foods was very hands on and the kids got involved in the session. It was raining a bit when we were there and they had umbrellas available which was handy."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Pleasant way to spend an afternoon. The displays were well set up and explained. The nocturnal house was great.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"2nd visit and if ever in Alice Springs again, would not hesitate to re-visit. Staff are excellent and the bird show is brilliant!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were at the Desert Park last week (first week of July) and did the Aboriginal desert survival talk with one of the rangers (Jeremy?). He was amazing. He gave a great overview of Aboriginal culture, survival techniques, food and medicinal foods. It was interesting for both adults and kids (they loved it when he made a fire using traditional Aboringinal tools). In addition, with the the birds and animals, this was a great day out"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A beautiful walk if you really look at the amazing variety of dessert vegetation. Excellent Cafe with beautiful view.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"With a day to fill we went to the park thinking we would fill a few hours. We stayed all day. The park is set in a big natural garden area with a good array of desert animals and exhibits. Imformative guided tours and exhibitions especially the desert survival presentation and bird show. Their nocturnal house is a highlight and generally the park is well presented. Good cafe as well. Be there by 9.30am as to ensure you see the bird show that starts at 10. You will have a great day, suitable for all ages."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Matt was great. Super helpful. Nocturnal museum cool. Desert mouse also. Nice park. Dingo was cool. Bird show was really good.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Only had a couple of hours to spare to see the place but found it well worth it. The bird show was very interesting but we thought it a bit short. The various aviaries are great & the nocturnal house excellent. There some great examples of local vegetation as you wander around.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A little pricey for what is offered and I only needed an hour to get around to everything but the bird show was great. They show a 20min movie in their cinema which was a highlight.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,great place to see animals that are native to the area as well as other wild life bird show really worth going to
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Bird show was wonderful, Aboriginal survival demonstration was terrific, loved being able to walk through the bird aviaries. This is a lovely, peaceful, well laid out, place, full of interesting things to see and learn about. My two teenagers really enjoyed it. Incredibly convenient that you can leave in the middle of the day and come back again in the afternoon. Great value for money."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We started our visit to Northern Territory by the Desert Park to get a feel of what we will see when going to Uluru and Kings Canyon. The site is huge and we've seen plenty of animals. We enjoyed particularly the birds show and the night tour. The night tour is really worth doing.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We loved our visit here, especially the bird show and the aboriginal survival in the desert. The was also an emu roaming around who was very cute and curious. Great day for kids too!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The introductory movie was terrific and concluded with a very dramatic scenery reveal when the huge movie screen lowered to the ground. Our guide, Jeremy, did a terrific job of introducing us to the culture with demonstrations of each Aboriginal tool, implement, foods, and more. Objects we'd seen in prior museum visits really came alive. The bird show with magpie, perigrine falcon,owls, etc. was fantastic. I really also enjoyed the exhibit of nocternal animals. The place is well worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great place, awesome guides, what a great place. Amphitheatre was fantastic. Lots of different things and animals too see. Also a great gift shop for souvenirs. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. They even have their own gophers for the elderly to use, great to see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We spent all afternoon here enjoying the birds and the flora. Very well set out and the nocturnal exhibit was fantastic.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Our visit to the Desert Park was short because it was during a Ghan train trip from Darwin to Adelaide. I was enthralled by the Birds of Prey exhibition and I found all the explanations very interesting and informative. I enjoyed hearing the aboriginal names of the mountain ranges and rivers. On viewing the rare animals in the Dark House I asked how many were endangered and the answer was ""All of them!"". I felt very privileged to have seen them."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a must do activity and leave about half a day. The bird show is quite amazing and I've never seen anything else like it. Great exhibitions, terrific talks and really well organised."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Larapinta is an amazing area to visit and experience the outback and see the stunning geography and geology of this sacred and ancient part of Australia
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Magic place for viewing and photographing wildlife, pleasant walk through different types of vegetation. nocturnal house a must see. A great place to spend most of the day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a place you have to visit when in Alice Springs. I just loved the close encounters with the bird life in the large aviaries. To see a male bustard in full plumage was wonderful. The first time my husband and I have ever seen that and we must have seen heaps of those birds in our travels. We all loved it and I could go again tomorrow and take my binos.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As others say, this is well worth the visit. The vegetation and surroundings are so different to that of the urban coastal enviro I am used to - felt like I was on Mars as it was such a contrast. I was struck with how very well maintained the whole place is - the entrance is very welcoming with beautiful Sturt Desert Peas. The bird show was fabulous. For me a 2 hour visit was fine but some stay for several hours."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Well worth the visit. The bird show is great, as is the aviary and nocturnal area. Nice way to get your eye in for the rest of your trip, to help identify flora and fauna"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park has lots of native flora and fauna, along with many entertaining and educational shows throughout the day. The staff are all knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions. This is a great opportunity to get up close and personal with kangaroos, since you can enter their enclosure with no fence between you!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Give yourself a day at the Desert Park before setting off to explore the region. By attending the talks and demonstrations throughout the day, one gains an insight into the creatures, natural environment and traditional way of life of the indigenous people who live in Central australia."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You can spend a lot of time here. The Nocturnal section is the best we have seen. Well worth the money, we had a great day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,So much to learn here and all so well presented by very informative guides. A bit expensive though and for goodness sake remember to take your identification as a Senior or Pensioner!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"An excellent, informative tourist destination. Well laid out with the awesome backdrop of the Mc Donald Ranges. Try to get to all the scheduled presentations. We bought senior concession day and nocturnal tickets, a great deal for $46.00 each."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We only planned a morning there but ended up spending 7 hours totally absorbed in what the desert park had to offer. Jeremy, the Aboriginal man who presented the demonstration of Aboriginal survival tools and techniques was not only entertaining and informative but also funny. The humorous way he gave the audience information made what he told us easier to remember and was interspersed with stories and legends. The bird behaviour demonstration was also wonderful and informative. Nocturnal house was excellent as was the talk."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great place to vist to see the native wildlife. Great for children and adults alike. Value for money, especially if you take in all the shows provided throughout the day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Whoops....planned for a morning here and sent the entire day. From the many bird enclosures to the nocturnal exhibits, there's so much to see and so much to learn. Just strolling around the park was lovely in itself. Staff were all very friendly and all very well informed. Especially enjoyed listening to Jeremy talk about bush survival. If you're in Alice Springs please put this place on your to do list."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Loved the Bush Tucker demo ...Our guide was very funny and very informative ...Loved the bird demo with Crystal think her name was..!loved the emu talk to....Thought concession entry was a little expensive at first $22... But we had 5 hours of shows.....The movie did not do it for me ..but good photography ..👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻worth a visit ..good walking shoes ..water and hats!!!!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We have been to the Desert Park on a previous visit,which we thoroughly enjoyed and were ver impressed with, this time we wanted to do the nocturnal tour and we were not disappointed, to be able to see almost extinct Australian Animals, ours was only a small group, the guide was very informative and friendly and it was lovely to have a staff member from the NT natural resources department helping out. I can only speak very highly of this special place"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great park with lots of different zones, so never seemed crowded. We saw how they train the birds and also had a talk about food from an Aboriginal lady. An interesting couple of hours learning about birds, animals and Aboriginal culture."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As people who usually avoids the tourist traps, We were very impressed with the Desert Park. We chose to walk the park at our own pace rather than do the guided walk. We loved the nocturnal house and were pleased to identify some of the many birds we had seen in the area. Although we didn't attend the free flying bird show or the eagle thing we were happy with what we considered value for money."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park covers a large area and is divided into a variety of desert zones. There are enclosures within each section giving you the opportunity to get close to the native wildlife. A truly fascinating experience which can be enjoyed by all age groups. And if you're a camera buff don't take your point and click as I stupidly did, take your SLR."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We did not have time to see the Eagles, but we found the Nocturnal Pavilion amazing, once you give your eyes time to adjust to the low light. We found a number of the external exhibits for the emus, dingos and roos to be pretty poor, with few animals and poor viewing aspects. Maybe we have been spoilt by seeing them in the wild during our outback travels."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Alice Springs Desert Park was excellent. The location - at the foot of the MacDonnell ranges - was excellent. The nocturnal house was excellent. The bird show was awesome! Theatrical and educational at the same time. It is all marvellously done, melding animals in captivity with those in the wild and the desert environment - many of the birds almost seem like they are in the wild. Aside from the wildlife, the whole park is great to walk around - it could be a botanical garden with all of the desert flora it harbours. A must visit in Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Location 5/5 Only 5 km or so from Alice Springs. Service 5/5 Very friendly and knowledgeable staff Value 5/5 It cost us $32 each for an adult but we stayed there for 4 hours (and still did not see the movie) so for that length of time at an attraction we considered it good value. There are many talks and displays during the day and it is possible to spend all day there. A must see is the Bird Show where they show you several of the local bird species and talk about them. They feed them, etc This show is on twice per day so make sure you get to see one of them. Also with the admission you can leave and come back on the same day. So you could do the morning and come back in the afternoon. This is an option as we were not really impressed with the caf (refer separate review - restaurants) Atmosphere 5/5 Great location on the side of the range. You get the feeling of being in the outback but you are close to town. Overall 5/5 A must see in Alice Springs but make sure you allow for plenty of time here. BUT the cafe at the park: Food 3/5 We had morning tea here and the only food options were commercial packaged items which were OK. No prices or menu shown. Coffee was average with very little froth on cappuccino. Not sure if they have better selection for lunch otherwise it would be pre-packaged sandwiches or pies. Service 3/5 Only 1 person serving and she was a bit overwhelmed and not very cheerful. Value 5/5 For what we had it was great value. Coffee, Sparkling Water and 2 cakes for under $15 Atmosphere Nice outdoor area with limited shade and normal run of the mill indoor area. Overall 3/5 Average caf with basic food but good value and conveniently located at park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a truly wonderful experience. Our 3 and 5 year old we're excited the whole time from getting up close to kangaroos to watching the spectacular bird show. The nocturnal house was a highlight for us- they have bilbies! And quolls, snakes, hopping mice and so many more desert animals we didn't even know were out there. Birds abound with many places to sit and just 'take it all in'. The Desert Park is well set up with toilets and drinking fountains throughout and has well maintained gardens and buildings. The gardener was very informative and kind to our children telling them about desert plants he was planting. Don't miss the film, the last scene is spectacular! Definitely worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"There were 4 of us in the group, self guided, but there spots where a guide talked about the animals. There are several walk in averies, and tonight we are going back for a nocturnal visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Alice Springs Desert Park is a must visit when you are in Alice Springs. The Park contains native animals and plants representative of the Outback desert environments, and also contributes to their conservation through research programs and public education. There are many habitats on display here, including desert rivers, sand, woodland, Nocturnal house, and more. A key part of the Park includes information on the Aboriginal culture, and how the indigenous people survived in such a harsh environment. A key presentation that you should try to see, is the 'Birds of Prey' show, featuring several of the birds of prey that inhabit the area."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It was good to visit and learn of the history of Alice Spring, how it got its name and of the story of the stolen Generation. I did feel that it was expensive to just see a few buildings."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a great place. We arrived at 7:30am and left after the park closed. The wildlife is amazing, the staff/presenters Greg and Damien were incredibly knowledgable, friendly and great for a chat. Located at the foot of the McDonnell ranges, the view is magnificent. Such a brilliant day and it's no surprise this place is 3rd on the list of things to do in Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Heaps of different areas, an interesting movie, such a surprise in the outback. Don't miss the bird show at 10 &3:30."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"When in Alice Springs on tour, we went here as an extra or 'option', and overall I found it to be very worthwhile. Our aboriginal guide Jeremy was the 'best, and the 'Birds of Prey' show was a so noteworthy. Well worth it!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Desert Park has a good collection of Australian animals and plants typical of the outback. Don't miss the short film prior to starting your tour of the exhibits-it provides a great history lesson and puts the desert and ranges into perspective.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Spent virtually all day there, had great fun. Loved the bird feeding show (fantastic for photography!) Also had the best experience with one of the aboriginal guides (Ramen I think) very informative, the best one I've seen! Great job."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very well done with the arid environment and animals displays so professionally done. Bird show the best I have ever seen plus talk given on Damien on Desert Survival was high on content and easy to understand and enjoyable and fun.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great place to visit, there is enough here to keep the family interested for hours. The park is split into sections, deserts and woodland.Talks and tours given by very knowledgeable and enthusiastic guides. Huge aviaries with various types of birds, some you can enter and walk around. Free falcon flying displays.Emus and kangaroos and much more. The nocturnal house was amazing, once you had adjusted to the lighting. Just a short drive from center of Alice, $25 by taxi. Only down side, cafe had limited food available the day we were there. Excellent shop though to buy souvenirs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited in late May. Tours are not overly busy which is great. Pam lead us through the night visit. Definitely do this tour if you are interested in conservation and new approaches taken in modern zoos. The day time bird visit also excellent. The animals of the Australian bush are incredible. The exhibits are presented in such a way that you don't feel intrusive. Our enthusiasm for the park was somewhat dampened by the rude woman at the front desk. We had forgotten our passes. I could understand be officious if reception was busy.... But there was no other patrons, no line of people. Why not treat your patrons better when they have travelled so far to visit you. The Cafe is poor. Bring your own food if you plan to stay over lunch. Unfortunately some of the ticket information given at the front desk was incorrect. The Park is not cheap but I was happy to pay the entry as a 'donation' to this wonderful place."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was the most amazing park I have ever visited in the world so far in regards to the way they keep and treat their animals. Real natural environments where creatures big and small can live a life naturally. Ok I am bit opposed to the way the lizards are kept in the cave enclosures, but overall a credit is due to the people running this Park. They clearly understand animals needs and everyone working there that I met were just full of heart. Thank you for a wonderful experience."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This place has a great birds show, i loved the part with the eagles. This is a good opportunity to see all kind of birds, little animals, lizards and snakes you wouldn't usually see... or you hope not to. Each type of animals have their own buildings, which is convenient to see some of the ""night life"" in the bush. The park also shows what kind of plants you would see in the outback. I went there after the summer heavy rains, so the ""garden"" was full of flowers. It looks probably very different now. You can visit there with a guide or by yourself, but you will need at least half a day to see everything and enjoy the shows. And you need a car to go there. It's way too far on bike."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Beautiful surroundings with very knowledgeable and helpful staff. A number of shows daily will keep the family entertained. Try to get there during the week when it is quieter.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the park during the day, made sure we went to all the shows which were really informative. We didn't feel the need to pay extra for the eagle in closure. If you are wanting to do the nighttime adventure walk I recommend doing it the night after so you get some rest in between. The nighttime tour was fantastic. A small group, and we got to see 7 out of 8 species which was awesome. Animals coming up to your feet and having the time just to watch them in there natural habitat was really special. The night ended with complimentary hot drinks and cake. A tour information brochure was also given out for you to take home. A great time for both young & old."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs Desert Park is beautifully landscaped, with surprising diversity of flora & fauna depicted in this lovely park. We walked around the entire park, and read all the very informative and quirky noticeboards. Highlights were the nocturnal house and the bird viewing. Ideal if time is limited, and it is not possible to travel out to the desert for a multi- day tour."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Memories of being up close to the animals in their own environment will stay with us forever. We loved all the birds. If you sit down quietly in their enclosures they come to you. Close your eyes and listen carefully to their songs. The Nocturnal House was bigger than we expected and we thoroughly enjoyed watching the various animals and their enclosures are a copy of their desert homes. We didn't think to bring hats but we didn't find walking around the park at all uncomfortable in the middle of the day in April and Alice Springs has cooled down a lot in May. We enjoyed looking at the desert bushes and we left with more knowledge about the desert and the animals that live there. We were more than happy with the price to enter because it was value for money compared to other tourist attractions. We are pensioners but the kids we saw in the park were always excited and calling out to their parents - hey come and look at this!. Don't miss it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park is now only average, not sure I would go again if in the area. That said, they have number of animals and a bird show that needs more polish. Scenic wise and with a guide it is interesting."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What s little gem close to the town of Alice springs. The nocturnal house worth it for sure. Only thing is it's a little expensive specially for concession holders but never the less a great thing to see
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a very refreshing experience to be able to go at your own pace with plenty going on. Very educational to have the park divided into land areas with vegetation and wildlife according to section beautifully presented.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I think that the Alice Springs Desert Park is the most important experience in Alice Springs. Here we are, in the desert, inhabited for tens of thousands of years by the Arrernte people, who survived on the plants and animals which have lived here from millions of years. All thriving in the climate and geology of the desert. You have come to experience the uniqueness of Alice Springs and the central Australian deserts. This experience needs you to understand that uniqueness... and the Desert Park is the place where this is all explained and demonstrated in ways you understand. For everyone from kids just learnt to stand to young people exploring the world, to Seniors looking back at a life of learning... Desert Park has such a range of experience that there's something for everyone. Then you can go out to the real desert with much more knowledge."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent almost a day at the fantastic Alice Springs Desert Park. Our three kids absolutely loved spotting birds in the aviaries and seeing the native animals, especially in the nocturnal house. The various talks and shows scheduled during the day are well worth doing. The Raptor show was very impressive. Best of all was a most interesting talk by Damien about the Aboriginal ways of living in the desert. He was very knowledgeable and personable and our kids loved helping him with some demonstrations (e.g. fire-starting). I could tell everyone else te was very interested too, thanks Damien and thanks Alice Springs Desert Park for broadening our knowledge of life in the amazing central Australian desert."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My partner and I spent over 5hrs walking around the Desert Park. We went to all the available talks and visited every part of the park. We thought it was good value for the price, as there is so much to see and most of these animals you wouldn't get to see up close in the wild. The keepers were friendly and informative. We happened to be there on a rainy day, but visitors can purchase ponchos if needed. We think Alice Springs is worth visiting just to go to the Desert Park!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I bought an American friend to Australia for the first time and she was really impressed with how well the desert park was laid out and also how informative the information was that was available to her.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"if you are heading to Alice springs, this park is a must. So much to see and do walking around the park. All the talks by staff in the different areas is great as well. A definite must to do is the nocturnal house. Give yours eyes a couple of minutes to adjust and you will spend quite some time wondering around admiring all the night life creatures"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park has an amazing wild bird show where trained birds show their skills. A falcon whizzed by trying to catch its 'prey', a buzzard opened an 'emu egg' and a barnyard owl flew over our heads silently - while the tawny frogmouth looked on! We also liked the aviaries where you could walk around with lots of local birds. Well signposted and informative material. The café had very good refreshments. Caught the bus from our hotel - runs at set times. You could spend a whole day there, though we had only 3 hours."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The talks we went to were very informative. The bird show was great but outside of those few things there was lots of walking and not much to see outside of birds. Maybe it was the time of year we visited, not sure. All the staff were very friendly and accommodating and the retail shop was good. The cafe didn't have much food in it but it is nicely set up."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was a highlight in our visit to Alice Springs. The organisation and professional attitude of all the staff made it a very pleasant day. We enjoyed a nice fresh lunch in the cafe and then wandered around the well kept exhibits. The Bird Show was excellent and exhilarating with the wedge tailed eagle as the star! Would like to give a mention to Matty who gave us great information and steered us in the right direction. Well done!!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the Desert Park prior to our Larapinta Trail trek after reading other reviews and we got so much out of it. The park provides a fantastic overview of the desert environment, fauna and flora, with excellent signs, displays and talks. The two must-sees are the flying bird show (wonderful!) and the Aboriginal Survival in the Desert talk. We learned so much about bush tucker, Aboriginal culture and customs from Anne who was extremely knowledgeable and entertaining. The Park gave us great basic desert knowledge that we were able to use on our Larapinta trek, from bush plants to birds to lizards. I can't recommend the Park highly enough, it's definitely worth spending a morning or afternoon here while in Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This should be the starting point before setting out to explore the Alice Springs area or travelling on to other desert areas. The best nocturnal house we have ever visited. The free flight bird show was unbelievable.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park is very interesting. The wildlife demonstrations are excellent. Of particular interest is the ""Aboriginal Survival in the Dessert"" presentation. Jeremy is outstanding!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I loved my visit to Alice Springs Desert Park. It was relaxing and informative. I absolutely loved the screening short movie at the beginning of the place. It's just amazing. And also the Nocturnal House which was really good. I spent most of my time here. The staff were really friendly and helpful too. They were even so kind and let me charge my mobile cos it had low battery. Thank you so much!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Shows you round central Australian desert environments, vegetation and animals. Brilliant bird display."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We thought it was expensive to get in, and that we would only be there for an hour or two but we were wrong! It's a great overview of life in the desert - plants, animals, great bird show, lovely aviaries and a fabulous nocturnal house. We spent over 4 hrs there and I recommend it to all visitors - overseas and local"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was a fantastic experience. The staff were friendly and helpful. We hired a disability scooter at only $10 for the day which enabled my husband to see and do everything the park had to offer. Great value for money.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"For anyone visiting Alice Springs, this place must be included on the to do list. BirdLife is amazing, programmes are very professionally run, the nocturnal exhibit out of this world. The nocturnal tour that starts at 1930 is something very special. Everyone is very well informed and will go out of their way to help. A must."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Loved the park, loads to see and easy to get around. The walk-in averies were a real highlight. You need at least half a day for the park, perhaps even more if you want to attend any of their guided activities. Find out the activity timetable ahead of your visit, or you may miss out on things that you'd have liked to do."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"For quite a few years now, we have brought a group of German Exchange students to the Desert Park for a nocturnal walk and an astronomy session. The star-studded desert skies are impressive for these students from Europe, who have never had the chance to see such clear skies. This year the presentation was given by two enthusiastic astronomers who provided telescopes for the students to look through. It was a great hit! The nocturnal walk was also excellent, led by knowledgeable and professional guides. Special thanks especially to Pam, who has helped organise this wonderful night for our students over the years. The Desert Park at night-time is definitely worth a visit!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a great park to visit the bird show was a highlight, as was the talk given by Damien on aboriginal survival in the desert. Highly recommend to begin your tour of the Mac Donnell Ranges to really appreciate what you are driving and walking through. Well done!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A truly wonderful representation of the variety of desert life in this area. Always visit when in Alice Springs
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Make sure you allow plenty of time especially if you want to join in on some of the talks and demonstrations. We spent four hours here easily. The bird demonstration was excellent (eagles etc). Very easy to walk around so no problem with prams or wheels of any kind.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A great insight to the wildlife in and around Alice! We did the night tour to defiantly worth it. Try to go morning as there isn't much shade
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We enjoyed our visit to the Desert Park with our children aged 6 & 3. We were glad it wasn't a hot day as it is a fair bit of walking outside without shade to get to all the exhibits. Highlights included the Birds of Prey show which had some interesting local birds including barn owls and falcons swooping their prey. The nocturnal house was one of the best we have seen in any zoo, with very active wildlife including bilbies, bandicoots and ghost bats. The highlight was the talk on bush survival by Damien which highlighted bush tucker and survival skills used by Aboriginal people in the local area. You need more than half a day to do everything, but the wristband allowing you to come & go was helpful as there was not much food available in the cafe."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very interesting and natural setting for the animals and park. The staff were lovely and very informative. We spent a good 3 hours going around it. The bird show was great.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,we loved every minute. It was so entertaining. Can't say enough about the place. the did a great job
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I thought i'd check out the desert park for a couple of hours but ended up being there until closing time as such a great place to hang out. Great views of the surrounding ranges from the park - lots of photo opportunities and great wildlife. Prolific birdlife both in the walk in aviarys and free flying around the park. The nocturnal house allows you to see those elusive animals like bilbys, numbats, owls and more. The bird show is truly amazing. There is a café with reasonably prices food and drinks so staying the day is easy. Also dotted around the park is free cool water for refilling bottles to just to sip. Ranger talks are included in admission fee so all in all it's great value. Loved it and will go back for sure"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Desert Park was great. We got to visit twice during our stay in Alice Springs. Most intressting and very good and informative staff that made the visit so good. The free flying bird show is a must so make sure you have time for that when you visit.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had an enjoyable time making our way throughout the nature park, because of being able to walk limited distances, we happily hired the scooter and the talking headphones, which aided our sightseeing as we ambled along. Sadly we were unable to keep up with a tour guide, but with the headphones directing us we had a wonderful few hours. The nocturnal building was wonderful. Just don't forget to take your water bottles."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"we spent half a day, and feel we barely got it all. We did not get all of the talks of course though. The nocturnal building was amazing! I do not know why this is not at other sanctuaries. Do as many of the talks and the video is a must. You would be silly to get to Alice and not go here."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic way to spend a morning or an afternoon or even most of the day. wandering through this natural environment with lots of displays and surprises, We loved our time there especially the Bird Display."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a good experience here. Our guide, Renate, was very good and knowledgeable. The bird show was a 5. The nocturnal exhibit was a 5. The walk through the river section was a 4. Nice space. Great surroundings. Well presented. Lots of walking if you want to cover a lot of it. Carry water -- it is a desert. 10 minute drive from the Doubletree (as a reference point). We spent all morning here and enjoyed the whole thing. Thanks, Renate. If this review is helpful then please indicate so below."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Lots to learn in the desert. Nice to have an aboriginal guide to share history and ways they live(d). Nocturnal exhibit is great. Some creatures you did not know about before. Bird show is different than any you have seen!!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We loved the Alice Springs Desert park. The aboriginal guides were most informative and interesting and the animals and flora we saw were great. The nocturnal house was brilliant. We missed the bird show but everything else was first class.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited durning the day and then went on a spotlighting tour. Both were excellent. The attention to land and animal care, the friendliness of the staff and their knowledge of the local flora and fauna is impressive."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It was approx $70 for a family visit. We loved it, particularly the nocturnal house with the python. Husband liked all the bird enclosures. Bring water - it was extremely hot. We found one water refill station (cooled) - great idea. Much appreciated. The indigenous talk about food and survival was great. We would have liked to have seen the bird demonstration - but missed it. Really enjoyable visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Luckily we visited the open park area on a not too hot day. The park has animals typical of this area. Emus, kangaroos, birds, and reptiles. If you are lucky enough to be there at the right time, there is a interesting demonstration of birds of prey. There is also a very nice gift shop with high quality items from this area."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Fab day out - go and watch the bird show and I highly recommend the Nocturnal tour. This place has nailed it!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I love this place! We took our children there when they were young (actually many years ago but I could only select April 2015) and they really enjoyed it even though we were very familiar with all of the animals. The birds of prey show was really worth planning your day around. Such a beautiful part of Australia to visit for Aussies and foreigners alike.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What a great achievement displaying nature at its best. Great walk-in areas with beautiful birds not scared of you. Beautiful different sections to walk through and also very well presented introductions by local people. Learnt a lot today.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Came to the desert park and were blown away by what we saw. Emus wandering down paths, kangaroos playing together, more varieties of birds than you can imagine in natural habitats. The park is well laid out, well signed and so quiet and peaceful. The flying birds display is not to be missed (10am daily)"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We came back for a second visit as we enjoyed ourselves so much the first time. We again missed the bird show, we cannot quite get our timing right, but it is still a great place to spend a few hours. The Nocturnal House is world class and we had the pleasure of seeing Bilby's at Easter. This is a must visit if in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The bird show and reptile enclosure were fantastic. The staff and rangers were very happy and enthusiastic to share their knowledge.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Come here and walk around. The availability of day and night fauna is remarkable. Great place for kids to see local fauna. The bird show is quite remarkable.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Large area to walk, plenty to see, 20 dollars entrance for 'oldies' the bird display is a must. Though there is plenty else to view. Water fountains around but best to carry a bottle of your own. Cafe and toilets available. A little way out of town but a 20/30 dollar taxi should cover the distance and they can arrange to pick you up too."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to wander around and have a little insight in the animals and plants in the red centre surrounding Alice. Very much enjoyed both the 'birdshow' as well as the night animals. Very knowledgable staff.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a side trip offered by the train service from Adelaide to Darwin on The Ghan. It was a very hot day, still very worthwhile. The 'display' of the birds in the theatre was stunning, especially the eagle, which was an additional bonus for guests from The Ghan. Also they do a very nice movie on the area at the end. Glad I went. Recommend it highly"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you are interested in flora and fauna, this is the best place to visit in central Australia. Get there early to make the most of your day. The birds of prey show alone is worth the modest entry fee, but there's much more to experience."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Place didn't seem like it was cleaned regularly, and the exhibits were very far apart. Favorite parts were the nocturnal house and bird show. Service at the entrance was very nice, and if you choose to join a tour group the guide is very thorough and enthusiastic."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,It was very hot when we were there and lots of flies but still worth the visit . A good bit of advice is buy a hat with a net attached or even a cork hat to keep the flies at bay . There were many trails to walk ranging in different levels from easy to hard going . Take plenty of water .
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We found the cultural interaction at the cultural display extremely interesting and we learnt a great deal about surviving in the bush. An absolute must if you visit the Park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I went here with the kids (2/4). We thoroughly enjoyed it and I would surely come again. We saw the bird show (what a COOOOOL show) and the lady that interacted with the birds was simply amazing. How do they do that sort of stuff with eagles, hawks and even an owl? It was amazing, I have never seen a show like this. The nocturnal house was simply fantastic. Again, I haven't see one made up like this with such big, long windows. It is dark so you take some time to get used to it. But the displays are one of a kind and the way it is set up is very unique. Saw Bilbys :) The whole park is gorgeous, would love to see it in the winter, we were there in the heat. Can def recommend, next time we'll do the torch walk :)"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,One of the real gems of Alice whether tourist or local. It is on the outskirts of town with amazing views. A favorite place of our kids with plenty of displays and shows that people of all ages can engage with. A great cross-section of the different desert environments is represented and perfect for tourists that can't get out and about too much outside of the town. The park has great educational information for kids and also hosts different events for families throughout the year. Well worth the time and money.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We did the nocturnal we'll in Feb. We were previously told by our travel agent in Melbourne that the tour was no longer running. So we were happy to find that the AAT Kings transfer was no longer running, but we could still do the tour. The tour was my wife & I, a couple from Canada, & our two guides. I knew we were in for a good night when 5 minutes in as we were all entrances by a bilby one of the guides said ""don't worry about that, look at this""!! We saw bilbys, burrowing belongs, echidnas, brush tailed betongs, malas, greater stock best rats & golden bandicoots. It was a good two hour your that finished with cake and coffee. I'd like to return through the day next time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Like many people, I'm sure, we were advised there wasn't much to do in Alice Springs but luckily had arranged to stay 2 nights so had time to get to the Desert Park. Needs a taxi or bus shuttle to get there but worth the effort. There are different desert habitats with animals as near to 'in the wild' as they can be. Various talks are given through the day with loads of information. I do recommend you give the park your support if you have the time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were in Alice Springs on Sunday, so the half day tour of the sights wasn't available. Decided to take in the Desert Park, but had to take a taxi. It was beautiful (though hot) and I would definitely recommend it if you have time. It's large, and beautifully landscaped in distinct areas according the ecology. The short show in the beautiful theater (air-conditioned!) on raptors was interesting - but mostly owls. (and one snake) We enjoyed the animals throughout the park, especially the Australian Bustard (a large bird) which was in full mating mode emitting clicks and roars which sounded like some sort of large wild mountain lion, and heard from a distance. His female counterpart was unimpressed, but we were. The highlight for us was time alone in the kangaroo enclosure with perhaps a dozen kangaroos. Granted they were all just hanging out in the shade, and not too active, but a couple did get up and demonstrate to us (close-up) their very silent and graceful jumps. The Nocturnal exhibit is wonderful, but we couldn't give it adequate attention, as it was getting close to closing time. If you have time in Alice Springs, I would definitely recommend a visit here, and am glad the since we weren't on a tour, we were able to enjoy it at our own pace. (I imagine a tour would limit your time there to an hour or less....) It has a great gift shop, and the attendant there was very helpful in calling our taxi for return ride to Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great walk and very informative. The animals were quite active and our 2 guides were extremely knowledgable. Hides described the conservation efforts for all the animals in the walk - can't see them in the wild anymore because most have been locally extinct due to the feral cats.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Simple park with walking trail . Plenty of wildlife including Wallaby and Bower Birds. We went in Summer so ample flies as well but still fascinating with a pleasant cafe and toilets.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My wife and I took our two sons to this amazing park on our first family holiday in Alice Springs. It's a great place to walk around and there's plenty of indigenous plants, animals, birds and reptiles to see and learn about. Also plenty of great photo opportunities. It's best to get there early in the morning to avoid the heat. Take water, sunscreen, insect repellant and comfortable footwear. We loved the bird's of prey display and the bush medicine and cultural talks by the local indigenous rangers."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I remember when we first came to Alice Springs back in 2006, we were advised to visit the Alice Springs Desert Park early, so we got there just after it opened. We ended up spending several hours there. We have been back every year since and it still remains as interesting as the first time, with new things seeming to be added each year. If you are interested in flora and fauna, this is the park to see. Starting at 7:30 am, it is a good time to start your visit, as rangers are feeding early in the morning. You should see the Big Screen Movie (love what happens at the end). The Bird Show is a must, and can vary depending on what creatures are available for the show. The animal enclosures are a must for the entire family including red kangaroos, emus and now the resident dingoes. If you are really lucky, you may even get to see the ranger walking them around the park. There are a number of walk-in avaries and of course the wonderful Nocturnal House. In the cooler months is the Eagle Encounter, a close encounter that you can capture on your camera for posterity. There are various ranger talks and as you walk through the park, you see examples of the different types of country. If you are able to, I highly recommend visiting the park at different times of the year, where you can experience the different seasons, including the wildflowers during spring. If you are here in the heat of summer, start your day early, bring blockout, a hat, a large bottle of water and comfortable walking shoes. As I write this, the new cycle path is nearing completion. Can't wait to cyle there for a day's outing."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to stay. Well priced and fabulous staff. Some of the best hotel service we have ever had. And the food was great.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My son and I were a bit shocked at the price but bit the bullet and so glad we did. Huge variety of flora and fauna, beautiful settings. Make sure to see the cinema show with a nice twist. Hat, water and comfortable shoes essential."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The park opens at 7:30am. The perfect time to be out before the day gets hot. Check the website for a schedule of walks and talks. Damian was very informative and a great speaker and guide during our visit. This park should be on your itinerary if your planning a visit to Alice Springs. Beautiful setting. Wonderful experience.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Our family visited this place for a few times. We liked it for the animals and the nice walk tracks.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a very good desert nature park with a large number of animals reptiles and birds, many of which you would not likely see on your own outside the park. There are the standard dingos, kangaroos, and emus that everyone is familiar with but also numerous lizards and snakes and birds, and a great nocturnal house for the things that only show themselves at night. There are several talks and demonstrations during the day in different areas of the park, including a very interesting free flight bird show held twice a day. The only drawback is the size of the park. It is spread out quite a bit and requires a lot of walking, which would not be a problem except for the extreme desert heat. Don't forget your hat and sunscreen."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is an excellent introduction to birds, wildlife and flora of the NT. The bird show is a highlight."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Take a small guided tour, to show an insight into Outback and Bush life. This is truly an amazing territory, a hard life, but one that must be based around natures behaviour in terms of weather, bushfires and regeneration, and wildlife."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent half a day at this attraction and could have easily spent longer. The Bird Show is a must see for people of all ages. Just fantastic seeing birds in their natural environment with the spectacular backdrop of the McDonnell Ranges. There are also other informative talks programmed throughout the day so make sure you check the schedule so you don't miss these. The park opens at 7.30am and in this climate it is a good idea to get out early in your walking shoes with a water bottle. Having said that, I think the first talk isn't until 9.30, there are water fountains (not cold) throughout the park and staff are happy to give you a ride if they are passing by. There is an airconditioned cafe with a fairly limited fare but great for a cold drink."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a great place to visit early on your central aus trip as they really manage to have a bit of everything here. The plants and wildlife are well presented and the cultural talks are well worth a listen.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Me and my friends had some spare time in Alice Springs, so got a minibus to the desert park. It was seriously raining, but the park lent us golf umbrellas for free! They also bought some of the planned shows inside, and came and got us in a golf buggy so we could go and watch the show! Staff couldn't have been more attentive and caring. There probably were not many visitors that day, but still we didn't request any special treatment. Park also have a wide range of animals to see, it took us a whole afternoon to walk round and we didn't get to see it all. Definitely worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My wife and i visited today on a tight schedule and explained our requirements to staff. We were directed on an exhibit itinerary and told a movie would be available at 3:15. This was incorrect and as a result we were denied the chance to see the film unless we returned the next day for an additional $10. This was sfter paying $50 to see the whole exhibit. Bad info and the exhibits we did see did not come close to being worth even half the admission price. Can not recommend to my fellow trip advisor reviewers.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A place to definitely come see. Wake up early and see the sun rise. Very magical. Bring lots of water and protein bars and a hat. Wear comfortable hiking shoes and good socks. Awesome for people in photography
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This desert trail runs right around Ayres Rock there are lots of viewing places and places for getting water and sitting down. You are not allowed take photos in some places and its good that people observe this as its technically a burial ground
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I honestly love coming here since I was a child and even now in my twenties I still love coming to the Desert Park. My favourite part about the whole Park is the Nocturnal house: Big snakes, Bilby, goannas etc but I love the lighting because it makes the roof look like stars and your in a night time desert."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The bird show was great as was the Nocturnal House. Wear a hat and bring water as there isn't a lot of shade.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The park was alright - a good portion is under reconstruction so you have to go back the same way. You also miss this dingos. The reptile house was good
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What an awesome animal park - absolutely loved it. It really made you feel like you were walking through the bush - great guide talks and bird show - particular loved the nocturnal house! Absolutely amazing! Highly recommended!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,offering a unique look into the diffrent landscapes and its animals. they have guides walking around to give you good info of the desert life and its animals. The birdshow is Great. Highly recommended
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Must see list when in Alice Springs. Raptor display is really good, and the character of the Magpie was sweet! Very well presented. The bird aviary was wonderful. I sat for half an hour on my own and was so thrilled to have a yellow bird sit on my leg! Awesome! Friendly staff."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Visited this amazing place with the family while in town recently and was not expecting much. However, was blown away by how much we got to see and learn about the local native flora and fauna. In fact, our day at the Desert Park turned out to be one of the highlights of our 3 week NT trip. The shows/talks were fantastic and all staff we encountered were extremely knowledgeable and clearly enthusiastic about education and conservation. Also loved being provided regular advice on when the next show/talk was on, so we didn't miss a thing. A terrific day out that was enjoyed immensely!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We hadnt been to Alice Springs for many years and were pleasantly surprised by the Park. The paths wind through various ""lands"" showing different ecosystems. There are enclosures for various birds and animals but these are tastefully set up and it doesnt feel like a zoo. Theres a couple of walk through bird enclosures, a walk into kangaroo area, a secure dingo display and an arena for the Bird ""Show"". This was the highlight for me, birds flying passed the audience, some walking through and others swooping toward the presenter. A great photgraphic opportunity. It felt natural not birds doing tricks. As well there was a Bush Medicine walk with a fabulous Ranger. He spoke with great knowledge and humour."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"After a long break between trips to Alice Springs I headed back into the red centre and made what used to be an ""essential"" visit to Alice Springs Desert Park to view ""hard to find"" species and explore the once great park. Sadly the park has undergone some huge changes and has clearly lost its way and direction. The new entry area leaves so much to be desired... a vast paved heat reflecting courtyard now greets visitors as they walk past moth-balled buildings such as the original entry building which sits empty and dirty. The sense of adventure and journey has really been lost in the new entrance... feels very out of place and is a different style to the rest of the park. The park feels ""old"" and ""tired""...alot of exhibits were either dirty or empty. The once great bird collection seems to have suffered massively - with exhibit signage boards visible empty and lacking interesting inhabitants... budgerigars and other common pet shop birds filling multiple exhibits! Some new exhibits have been added (dingo, goanna and a new emu area), although like the entrance area they don't match the style of the rest of the park. The dingo area couldn't be more of a ""fenced in box"" if it tried, complete with visible dog kennels - not good at all! The new emu area was clearly built on a budget - chicken wire and start pickets... hardly a cutting edge exhibit like what the park was once known for. One pleasant addition was the new aquarium area - very good graphics and viewing of desert fish. The same could not be said for the goanna exhibit built opposite the aquarium - it seemed ridiculously overly engineered and the exhibit furnishings poorly chosen and landscaped. Guides and staff were sparse also... like the animal collection, the staff appear to have been cut back or lost altogether! The absence of staff and obvious change in management meant the education and ""story based"" experiences and strong styling that the park once had have now been lost. The Nature Theater bird display was engaging enough, but a magpie, galah and frogmouth are far from the once impressive show that featured falcons, kites, hawks and buzzards. Even the renowned nocturnal house has fallen victim to whatever has washed over the park... broken graphic displays, empty exhibits and reduction in species displayed. A venue I once would have recommended that ""everyone"" visit in the red centre has now become a ""fizzer"". I left the park feeling very down about its poor state, lack of species display and overall ""dead feeling"" it had... not the ""essential introduction the desert"" it once was. Management should have a long hard review of what the park once stood for... a clear victim of lost direction and identity."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I have been here a few times. It is a beautiful place to visit, I love the back drop of the mountains, and all of the beautiful desert flora. The movie in the auditorium is a bit out dated, needs to be remade in my opinion."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Night Tour is a fabulous experience. Viewing vulnerable or extinct-in-the-wild animals (plus echidnas) in a small group with knowledgable guides
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I might be biased, because I like desert life! Like many zoos, it has different talks at set times of the day, and I learnt something new from them. It had a nice natural atmosphere. Some of the staff were Aboriginal - the only place in Alice Springs I'd been to that had Aboriginal staff. Potential caveats for those without their own car: I visited there on New Year's Day. I decided not to take the first transfer from Alice Springs to the park, and took a transfer back to Alice Springs, so I wasn't able to see all of the park, or see all of the talks. Being New Year's Day, the cafe was understandably not open. As I hadn't brought my own food, the only option was the vending machines. If you're planning on attending the night spotting, keep in mind that the cafe closes at 2 pm, so you'll need to either bring your own dinner or head back into town. (They do provide tea and mud cake, but mud cake does not dinner itself make!)"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My wife and I had half a day to spare when visiting Alice Springs in October 2015 and decided to go to Desert Park - what a brilliant decision. During out visit to Australia we visited a number of animal parks and aquarium in NSW, NT and Queensland and Desert Park is by far the best. There are hourly demonstrations/explanations about the different animals and the staff are knowledgeable, friendly and a credit to Desert Park. If you go do not miss the demonstration of the Birds flying - I have never seen such a brilliant display. I do have a regret about Desert Park and that is that we only had half a day to spend there. I am not even sure that a whole day would have been enough time. Desert Park is too far away from us in the UK for another visit but we keep in touch daily through their facebook page and are looking forward to being able to visit them again in the future and to spending at least a day in Desert Park"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Went to an Australian desert park to be greeted and served by anyone BUT Australians??? What the? Cmon Aussies take some pride
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Initially my thoughts were ""what on earth are we going to see in a desert"". My thoughts changed instantly and we were captivated by a young guy who was our guide - he was physically disabled and in a motorised chair. He was a breath of fresh air and after a while being with him the chair disappeared and his enchanting personality captured us all. Was a highlight of our trip to Alice Springs. Especially loved the bird arena and show."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Came as part of The Ghan experience and was very happy with this stop. The guides are very well informed and the training of the birds in the bird show was a highlight. Highly recommend.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Alice Springs Desert Park is located 20 minutes from Alice Springs town and is easy access by car and is serviced by many tour companies. The highlight is the free flight bird show. Various birds including birds of prey can be seen close by with excellent commentary. This park is sectioned to show various habitats of Central Australia. The animals and birds in cages are well looked after giving them plenty of room to roam and fly. Do not miss the nocturnal exhibition which shows animals you may never see. You will need plenty of time to see all the park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great attraction, with a good bird show. Can get very hot in summer so recommend going early in the day. Nice dingos, reasonably priced."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,If you happen to stop in Alice Springs during your trip to Australia don't miss the chance to go this park and enjoy the real life in Central Australian desert.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I highly recommend a visit to Alice Springs Desert Park. The park is set along the mountain ridge near Alice Springs and offers a variety of wildlife and ecological exhibits. Don't miss the bird show. Excellent, excellent, excellent."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A friend of mine told me to visit the park and he was definately right. The park entree was quite chep as we booked it at the hostel together with a transport to the park. In the park are nice walks and a really impressing nighthouse and bird show where you can learn a lot about the dessert animals.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,best place to get an understanding of animal and plant life in the desert great nocturnal display and one of the few places to see bilbies
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Had a great day at the Desert Park. This is a fantastic place to visit if you are in Alice Springs. The surroundings and scenery is just beautiful. There is a brilliant nocturnal house which homed a great variety of creatures. We loved the ghost bats and all the different lizards in particular. We had a really informative and interesting guided talk from Renate on aboriginal culture and food. We learnt so much. Renate was very friendly and we were able to ask questions and touch the tools and foods. This made the talk fun as well. The bird sections were great too. The birds were beautiful and we got lots of photos. We saw a beautiful and huge lizard wandering around free in the park. It was amazing and got a few photos before he ran off. I loved seeing the kangaroos and it was fun to walk through their enclosure and get up close to them. We saw the dingos on our way back, which was great too. We were lucky to see some of the bigger birds getting ready for their Christmas photos. Staff were kind enough to let us get photos whilst they were transporting them there. We stopped in the large gift shop which had a lot of great souvenirs for presents for our family. All the staff were friendly and said hello and asked if we needed help. Definitely worth a visit! Kids would love this."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Travelling around Australia for two weeks by car, we had seen all the animals they had to offer and furthermore the place is too focused on birds for my taste. Another thing the place is missing is a discription of all the animals and where they are naturally found"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went at at around 9am at the end of September. There are many things to see and do. The Nocturnal house is awesome. See Bilby's and other nocturnal animals, close up. There is a full day of activities. Don't forget your camera gear."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This place has developed well since I was here 14 years ago. It now offers an impressively informative, interesting and well laid out introduction to the flora and fauna of the region, and is a great introduction to what most people will see as they journey out of Alice Springs. For Australians it can be informative and a memory-jogger. For visitors from overseas, it is an almost essential introduction to their forthcoming experiences. Allow yourself 2-3 hours for the visit, and come away with an increased knowledge and understanding of what Australia is all about."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We arrived the park in the afternoon and found that most of the activities were only available in the morning session. We could only join the bird show which was an amazing experience to us. The birds walked around your feet or hovered just above your head. That's awesome!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I could not think more of this place. There is so much to see and do. From walking around the amazing grounds and having a look at the dingoes, kangaroos, emus, countless varieties of birds, to doing guided tours with very informative and relaxed guides. The Nocturnal tour was a massive highlight, to see those amazing animals that are virtually impossible to see naturally was amazing. We finished the day with the Bird Show, which was super fun. Thanks everyone at Desert Park, you all do an amazing job."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is an amazing park with really good information about wildlife and the environment in the desert, well set out and beautifully kept."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This park is small but very interesting for a few hours. In the Nocturnal House you see animals move about when normally they would be asleep. The park is well laid out with different terrains to investigate but the best part for me was the Birds of Prey show. Wonderfully presented and all the birds performed on cue.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Allow a full day for this experience as there are lots of talks about differents animals .. we saw dingos, a birds of prey flying display and a walk & talk in their large airconditioned nocturnal animal house. There are also different terrains to explore .. lots we did not see. All with the West Macdonnell range in the background. Staff were really good during their subject talks on things like aboriginal foods. Cafe food was tasty but basic when we went .. there are lots of drinking water fountains around the park. We used the Alice wanderer to get there .. best to book it the day before and if you are oold enough tell them you are a senior to save money."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Ended up being here all day. Kids were (unusually) enthralled by it all. Quiet season now, so we had most of the guides and demonstrations to ourselves! Brilliant to be able to ask tons of questions. Be aware that the Cafe closes early! We were all devastated to not be able to access icy-poles on a very hot afternoon!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We only had 1 full day in Alice Springs so we decided to spend the early afternoon at the Alice Springs Desert Park. We thoroughly enjoyed it & this park has an array of animals. The staff at the front were extremely friendly & helpful.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you are an outdoors sort of person, and have children of various ages, don't think you are going to zoom through in 20 mins. Devote some hours to this venue. Highlights include the Nocturnal House & the various bird enclosures - all set in a garden to replicate the various habitats in arid Northern Territory. If you time it right, you could have your picture with a Wedge-Tailed Eagle resting on your arm, or see the Night Wildlife Tour. Being an outdoors venue, make sure you bring your hat & carry water. The only downside is the poor public transport to the Desert Park. It is close to 7 km from down town Alice Springs - a serious walk each way."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We first visited Desert Park just after it opened in 1997 and we thought we would come back again for a visit to see what improvements had been made over the past years.We were not disappointed,it was great to see the original high standards being maintained by the friendly,dedicated staff of today.It is very easy to spend many hours here just wandering around on your own,or enjoy the information and insights provided by guides.We started our visit by going to the Cinema and watching a 20 minute film on the big screen - its not to be missed, amazing photography.Other ""must do's"" are the Nocturnal House,Survival in the Desert,and especially Nature Theatre where the raptors fly above your head.This takes place twice a day at 10.00am and 3.30pm,so plan your visit if you want to experience this.Also,there is a Nocturnal tour to give you a different perspective.All up,a great place to visit. My only complaint concerns the ""Cafe"" and the lack of variety of food available for lunch.I know its ""Low Season"",but only having 1 Pasty,and 1 sausage roll available for about 20 people seeking lunch is not good enough."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We went there for a night time wildlife tour to see rare nocturnal animals like malas. It's a fenced off area specially for endangered species to recuperate. The guides were great and we saw lots of animals.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"excellent park. visited expecting to stay an hour, stayed 6, could have stayed longer too. ranger guided events all excellent, a must see is the bird flying - never leave alice without seeing the trained magpie. well done staff."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,It is difficult to not be overcome with the significance of this park. The rock paintings alone remind you of the history and the significance of the rocks to the local indigenous people.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Wow - Melbourne Zoo could learn a lot from you! For a $10 fee, you can hire a mobility scooter to zoom around and enjoy the whole park. I loved this as I could fully explore and enjoy this experience with my kids. Fabulously set out park with a great variety of wildlife. Super helpful staff and a nice shop too. A truly positive experience."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I came to this attraction, not in the mood for desert, animals or a cultural talk (due to anxiety of a presentation the next day). This was an amazing visit and one that I would recommend to become aware of the Aboriginal culture and heritage. Amazing."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I have been coming to Alice Springs for business for several years. Today I had some spare time to visit Alice Springs Desert Park. I went to see the Dingo talk, the bird presentation, the nocturnal exhibit, the talk on on Aboriginal food and I went to the cinema. All were absolutely wonderful. This place is a must if you're in the Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,have been privileged to get to the nocturnal tour twice in the last year it is an amazing and very special experience very special animals presented in such a professionally managed setup
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to spend a few hours for both first time and frequent visitors. There are three usual animals - kangaroos etc. We really enjoyed the self guided your with audio descriptions of habitat and plants. There is also an amazing bird avery. A must is the video presentation is amazing so do yourself a favour and watch it. It runs every half hour or so. Give it a go out is well worth the entrance fee.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"where else can you go & se the most sepctacular birds of prey, wondeerful plants & the nocturnal display is excellent. The rangers were very knowledgeable and friendly. The cafe provides the necessary nourishment. the film was spectacular ."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's really well done. The other exhibits were grand too, very informative and the staff are knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Definitely worth a visit and don't worry about the walk - it's a manageable stroll."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We rented a bike and after 30 minutes ride we arrive in the desert park. Perfect timing as the bird show was going to start. Eagle, hawk, owl and more birds were flying in front of our eyes with a great information given by the park ranger. Walking in the park was very relaxing."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Desert-lite experience but up close to animals. great feed and friendly staff...on a balmy night, it really was a treat"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We went early morning when it was cooler and ending up staying most of the day! Even then we didn't see everything. Make the most of the keepers and guides and their talks and excursions. They were friendly and knowledgeable and added to the experience. Highlights were the bird show and the Eagle experience which is well worth paying the extra for. And when it gets too hot outside go and see the free show in the cool of the cinema.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park is well laid out and very interesting to wander around discovering different things about the outback The bird show is well worth a look, it's amazing how they can train these birds. Well done"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Make sure you visit the Desert Park when staying in Alice Springs. The collection of endemic flora and fauna is second to none and the knowledge of the local guides is fantastic.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very nice park with a lot of native flowers. The enclosures are set out in a natural way and you get good views of the animals and birds.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We spent most of the day at the desert park and felt it was so good we went back and did the nocturnal tour .The guides were very informative and we saw lots of animals
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A must for any age group, singles, families or tour group. The ranges surrounding the Park a truly beautiful. Ask about the night experience."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park offers a very good introduction to the outback including floral, fauna and wild life, mainly birds. There are plenty of guided activities happening. You would be hard pressed not to get your money's worth."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Visited with my mum and brother and we had a great time and learnt a lot. We especially enjoyed the boomerang demonstration and presentation on aboriginal art.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Well set out and very informative attractions. Bird display in morning and afternoon is a must see! Staff are well informed and happy to assist.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Just like all other tourists we were told this was a ""must see"". Glad we decided to heed the advice as it proved to be the most interesting (and educational) thing we did on our visit to the Alice. The introductory video/movie was inspiring , All the staff we came into contact with were friendly and quite prepared to all of our questions. At the end of the day, I didn't want to leave and even asked if they had any jobs vacant and could I camp out next to the dingoes. Definitely a ""MUST DO"" if you are in the area."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You can spend days here and not get bored. It is a fantastic attraction in the middle of Australia. The Free Flying Bird Show is amazing, all of the guides are approachable, knowledgable and most of all friendly. Food at the cafeteria is good, make sure you experience this park!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"On a short visit to this region we read online that this was a ""must see"" place, so we decided to follow the advice. That was the best decision we have ever made - from walking into the theatre and watching a movie about the formation of the region to the highly interesting talk on how the indiginous people are able to survive by using everything in their surroundings. If you thought the desert was sand and sun this is a real eye opener not to be missed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had almost a full day there and had a really great experience. Do NOT miss the bird show (3.30pm) it really is top class and the eagle experience is also really really good.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you like birds you will love this place, heaps of avaries everywhere. Not many other large animals, couple of kangaroos sitting around and a couple of dingoes and emus. The nocturnal house is great, probably about the best thing in the park, heaps of snakes and lizards and small nocturnal animals in different glass enclosures. You can see these same animals at the reptile centre in town. You could spend a few hours here walking around, or longer if you go to the talks, which are on every hour or so in different parts of the park. The bird show is quite good, especially the eagle and the owls. There's a short film at the entrance that is interesting if you have the time and a gift shop when you come out. The park is a fair way out of town, which is logical, but if you're not driving it will cost you a lot to get there. Too far to walk, bus doesn't go out that far and taxi is very expensive. We booked a tour bus through Alice Wanderer which picks people up from their apartments and drops you off at the park then picks you back up again later. This was quite expensive and only have certain pick up and drop off times. That said there was only 1 other couple on the bus with us so didn't have to drive around picking people up all morning and on return we were the only ones on the bus so got dropped off where we wanted to go. They also organised entry fees. I think it costs $25 per person to get in which is a bit steep. Probably wouldn't go back here, once was enough to see everything."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Would Recommend! When here make sure you definatly watch the Bird show that is in the morning it is a 10/10 experience and you would not get anywhere else. Then make you way back around the park looking at all their cool wildlife.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This a lovely spot to visit the plants are amazing I think it still a work in progress but it is still enjoyable
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is top of the list of things to do in Alice .we were blown away by this tourist attraction and the knowledge that you came away with regarding the desert and it's inhabitants. If you can make it for the bush medicine and bird show as well as the nocturnal exhibit you will not be disapointed .
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We sought quite expensive entry to the park. Our grand daughter didn't have her student card with her, so she was expected to pay full entry. Sorry folks, you just missed out on three more visitors. But I guess that will not cause the management any grief. Don't think your entry fee is where the payola ends. Have your wallet at hand should you wish to enjoy? other exhibits once you are in. Please don't rip off the tourists."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a good half day with a few highlights which included the dingo talk, the nocturnal house and meeting some of the local bird life in the Amphitheatre display. The staff seemed genuinely happy to be here and why wouldn't you be - what a great place to work, nestled below the MacDonnell ranges."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is one o the best places to visit in town, is half museum half zoo and it´s great , you can get a class of desert survival from one of the true aboriginals that lived here for thousands of years. Don´t miss the bird show"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What an amazing place Alice Springs is. To have this wonderful park and fantastic bird show really helps one appreciate this vast country. The animals, birds, land, history and information were all great. The staff were friendly, helpful and were happy to share their knowledge. Alice Springs Desert Park is really worth a visit. Make sure you give yourself enough time to see it all."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What a magnificent place! Fabulous vistas, close to Alice Springs yet you feel you're really out bush. An enormous nocturnal house and a stunning bird show bookended our visit. We would suggest you don't get too excited by the cafe. And be prepared to walk a lot!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I visited the Desert Park on my last day in Alice Springs and it was so good I realised I should have gone earlier - namely before I did my tour to Uluru. Early October was a great time to visit as the birds became very active in the last afternoon as the sun was starting to set. I planned to nip out for an hour to see the bird show and nocturnal house but ended up staying from 3:15 to closing time at 6 and nearly got locked in!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Set in a beautiful location beside the McDonnell Ranges. The bird show is great with the birds appearing to fly in from the wild and they fly only metres from the crowd. There are several displays all well set out. Guides give talks throughout the day. The gardens are well maintained and are a credit. The movie is worth watching, especially the end when the screen is lowered. A good day out."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This place is worth the visit, especially for the 10.00 am show- which no guest should miss realy. This show exceeded expectations and is better than Andy other show i have seen in other zoos (or aquariums, to be honnest) The rest of the park offers nice walks, and is a bird lover's paradise."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We mainly went to see the Bird Show, but the whole park is fantastic, we had such a great time. We were the first there at 07:30 and had the park to ourselfs for awhile. All areas of the park are great, this place is really worth visiting, but go early. Now the Bird show was something else, the best i have seen, from the Eagles to the Magpie that made different calls on command, to the Raptors. Do your self a favor and visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Arrived at 3pm after noticing the sign saying open till 6.30pm. Ventured in to what felt a bit like the Griswells arriving at Wally World with no one in site. Entered the reception area and was greeted with a $25/head entry fee. Gladly paid as I had read that this place was ""world renowned"". Slightly disappointed. Would say this may be more for the younger families with kids, and of course the o'seas touristy types."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic park and well worth the visit, the birds of prey is a must and the best way to enjoy the park is to really take your time and sit down in the enclosures. Doing this will allow you to see all the bits you would miss if you just walk through. The Nocturnal house was brilliant and the movie a great introduction the region and its varying landscapes and flora and fauna. Definitely worth doing when you're in Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent 6 hours at Desert Park.....a fact that our friendly Cabby could not believe as he had never taken anybody there who had been there longer than 3 -4 hours. It was a coolish day, which was good as there was a lot of walking involved. Animals were great and the various talks and bird displays done by informed staff. We particularly enjoyed the Aboriginal talk, and what to find to eat if surving in the bush.....we didn't however take up his offer to eat a witchy-grub tho !!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had an enjoyable afternoon at the Desert Park but it was an extremely hot day and the park is very large and requires a lot of walking in the full sun. If possible go early morning before the heat kicks in. The wild life Presentations were very informative so it is worth planning your day around their talks. The 'Birds of Prey' demonstration was enjoyable and you were seated in the shade. Unfortunately we missed the indoor movie but I would suggest leaving this until last as it is in an air conditioned theatre and will get you out of the afternoon heat on a hot day. The park is very clean and easy to walk around if you have little ones in a stroller. The big disappointment for us was the cafe which was just a few chairs and tables and very limited food. All they had was a few pies, sausage rolls and a few very ordinary looking sandwiches. So my vision of having a delicious lunch there certainly did not eventuate. It would also be nice if they had a courtesy buggy with driver touring around the park that could offer people rides like many zoos and wildlife parks do overseas. If you are self-driving There is ample car parking available at no charge."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was truly excited to have an opportunity to see native animals in their natural habitat rather than in cages like at a typical zoo. The first exhibit we saw was the dingoes that were being walked around the park; having a chance to see them up close was truly special and a wonderful experience. Our next stop was the nocturnal house which was probably worth the price of admission by itself. Inside were a range of native animals that are nocturnal in nature (snakes, spiders, lizards, rats, frogs etc). This area was well prepared and the information was outstanding. Best of all it was air conditioned and a chance to step out of the heat for a while. I next wandered around the rest of the park and truth be told was a little disappointed. The kangaroo area had five kangaroos, the emu area had two emus, the aquarium was much smaller than what I had expected and the bird enclosures seemed to be a bit of an afterthought and probably needed some work. The visit was concluded with a bird show run by the park. This was amazing. A variety of birds of prey and a sneaky magpie were shown to the crowd. Whilst each bird was flying around, one of the handlers provided a commentary about the bird including what it eats, where it hunts, how it hunts and other interesting facts. Seeing a wedgetail eagle (with its 2m wingspan) up close was phenomenal. All in all, glad I visited but I probably wouldn't go again."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A trip to the Desert Park provides a peaceful day out for the family with lots to see and do. We took the 8am transfer bus from our accommodation so as to not miss the 10am free flight bird show which should not be missed. Their are a number of separate aviaries around the park which gave us an excellent insight into the bird life of the area. The talks and presentations are also an excellent insight into the local Aboriginal culture. The Cafe however could do a lot better but we didn't go there to eat.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I had read, and been told, that if we didn't have time for many attractions in the Alice, we must choose the Desert Park. On Larapinta Drive 8 km west of town, this outdoor natural history museum nestles at the foot of the MacDonnell Ranges, which provide a dramatic backdrop. The Park is divided into three sections – Woodland, Sand Country, and Desert Rivers – and you can follow a trail that takes in all three. You'll come across the most wonderful walk-through aviaries and a large Nocturnal House, which is so dark it's tricky to spot some of its less active inhabitants! As you walk the walk you'll come across emus and roos and dingos, and there is a variety of presentations and guided 'discovery' walks to choose from. I'd also been advised that, from a varied range of activities, I absolutely must watch the free-flying bird show. Thank goodness we got there in time for the afternoon session in the Nature Theatre. (The two shows daily are at 10 am and 3.30 pm.) All the 'acts' were extraordinary, but two of them in particular were outstanding, and I will never forget them. I'm not going to spoil their impact by describing them in detail: just make sure you don't miss this, especially if you love birds. In the aviaries we saw and heard a huge variety of birds native to the Northern Territory, and in each of the three areas of the Park habitats are effectively recreated. So, for example, there's a dry channel in the Desert Rivers section. Three hours was not enough for us, not to really do justice to all there is on offer. Half a day minimum I would recommend."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had traveled across NT without seeing some lot of wildlife but here we saw absolutely everything we had read about. Absolutely gorgeous setting too.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A wonderful place to learn about the desert and it's animals.. Bush foods show a must.. check out show times and plan your day before going..
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Located a short distance put of Alice Springs is this centre operated by the NT Wildlife Service with many birds & animals that have been found injured & couldn't be returned to the wild. The animals are located in virgin desert enclosures, & it is possible to access some of these. There are other enclosures for birds & reptiles. There are frequent ranger talks at different sections, included one with owls & raptors, plus dingos. It is good to see such a large range of outback animals. I also signed up for the Wedge Tail Eagle talk (for a fee) where we got to hold an eagle. There is a gift shop at the entrance. There was also a café there which I didn't visit so won't comment on."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I went to the Desert Park with some friends and our young children. We had planned to spend the entire day exploring, but weren't able to. We enjoyed the bird show and walking around the park and decided to have lunch before going around the rest of the park. The food at the cafe was overpriced and there were not enough options for decent food. The older lady serving in the cafe was unpleasant to deal with. We ended up leaving early because our children were hungry. Definitely take your own food if visiting!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic park the bird show was amazing and Krystal was very knowledgable didn't go through the motions, the best I have seen and the cultural talk by Jeremy was very educational"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Wonderful, spacious site; bird show spectacular; talk about indigenous practices very interesting, guides inspiring.Cafe a bit chaotic."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had heard about this place from various people but have to say that we were absolutely blown away. The presentation of the whole park is superb and all the animals (and plants) seem very well cared for. The bird show is a must see and we also indulged in the eagle experience. We spent virtually the whole day there - it really is that good.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Went for the raptor display, the bird performance was brilliant , flew through the audience, the handlers gave a good talk about each bird, saw the what happens when a young wedge tail enters another wedgys area, the submissive bird walks on the ground"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park nestles under the ragged red ramparts of the West Macdonald Ranges right in the city of Alice Springs. It naturally has all the elements of the surrounding ranges...plants, views, animals, birds ...the desert flowers and water hokes. The nocturnal creatures...you can wallow in the red centre right there in town. The walking is good for all levels and wheelchair friendly. The wild flight show. Bush tucker show, it's a great Australian asset. Catch town transport to the door or drive, but go."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park is great the wildflowers are all coming out this time of year so very pretty, has all the ecosystems of the outback and how they interlink, staff could be a little friendlier they didn't seem very interested"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Pros- My mum and I were enthralled with the Rapture show, just brilliant with Eagles and kites swooping over your head-the magpie was so intelligent and the crane stole the show-he did a runner.... The Cultural display/discussion with Jeremy was fantastic. Very informative and entertaining young man. The Nocturnal house was well worth the effort. So much thought, car and planning has gone into the park, especially the flora and fauna and its a credit to the owners and staff. Cons- Would like to see more time and effort put into the Dingo enclosure as they appeared very unhappy, trying to escape. We weren't very impressed with our sandwich for lunch. But till a wonderful day out."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great place to visit. Extremely interesting and informative. The bird show is not to be missed. Probably not the place to walk around if it is wet and raining as there is no cover as such along the walks. You could easily spend the whole day there and probably should in order to see it all. We were just a couple, but this is a good family place to visit. The kids should love it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Extremely informative of the different desert areas & it's diverse creatures. A great setup for delivering the information. Very interesting.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I looked at ""things to do"" in Alice Springs, and this park was very high on the list. When bus dropped us off early in the morning, I wondered where on earth we were. I only saw scrub and sand. We collected the map of the park and the list of talks which were being offered on the day. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I realised very quickly, the trick to getting the most out of this attraction was getting there early to enjoy these ""talks"". We particularly enjoyed the presentation from the Aboriginal gentleman. He gave me new insights and I gained knowledge and respect for our first inhabitants. We had a quick lunch before leaving,in the cafe (very good). Seeing the animals in their environment was of particular interest. A great day out."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very interesting and informative displays plus great presentations of the local bird life and bush tucker and surviving in the outback.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Desert Park is doing a great job. The night tour was the best and we saw many night creatures such as Bilbys and the rare Marla among others.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Lots of wildlife and great eagle show - staff very friendly - movie was a bit boring and expected more about the history
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,You must visit the Desert Park in Alice Springs and leave yourself at least three hours to do it. The staff are very informed about the environment they are speaking of. There are a number of different areas to enjoy encompassing all the area types of the outback. Must see.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Desert Park is really worth seeing. The birds of prey show is very interactive as the birds get quite close. There are many informative talks. The nocturnal animal display is amazing it houses rare and endangered native animals and you can see them close up. Watch the movie in the cinema at the end it has a lovely surprise. Kids loved it here.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We have been to the Alice before but have literally missed this attraction. That was our loss, but this time we hit pay dirt. This is a well set out park in sections representing ""desert"" areas in the outback. Tree and bush planting is excellent and expect to see birds aplenty. The main attraction is a bird of prey show and it is really worth a look. The birds enter on cue and delight with their display. We see them up high but here you see them up close. The show was amusing in that a wild crow was upstaging everything. It may not be there for later shows but I suspect it knows a good thing. Another highlight is the nocturnal area where Bilbies, Numbats, Quolls etc hang out. These are animals we rarely see but you will see them here ( hopefully). They are flighty little things so maybe in cover but if you are there for feeding you will see them. There are also some reptiles which are always fun to see up close. The staff are passionate about their job and the perk is a real little treasure."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited this park as a group of over 60's ( 4 of us) and attended the bird show which was fantastic. Unfortunately not enough time as late in the day to see other shows. We were disappointed the café was not open to get a coffee before or after. Fantastic display of wildflowers at the entrance and inside the attraction. I thought there would be more reptiles but still lots to see. Great place for kids and adults
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great Rangers,knowledgeable,and helpful. Soured by Katie at desk who was very officious and not terribly pleasant.A shame to present this first point of contact to overseas visitors as all other trained staff were marvellous."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was an option offered when we travelled on The Ghan. I am so glad we chose this option. If you are in Alice Springs you MUST go here and time your visit so you can see the Bird Show. Its amazing what that young man can do with these wild creatures. A must see! The tour of the park and the different plants is very interesting too.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We really enjoyed our half day here - there is a lot to see and do so would recommend a full day. The talks on throughout the day with park staff were high quality and worth it - Anne's bush tucker talk was particularly good. Thoroughly worth a visit.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We loved visiting this park. It was just fantastic! The free flying bird show and the personal eagle experience were out of this world. HIGHLY recommended.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Overall it's a nice place to spend some time. All staff were very friendly and helpful. Amenities and cafe were clean and getting up close to the Eagle was well worthwhile
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Allow at least half a day. The bird show is heart-stopping! We also loved quiet time spent in the aviaries, the wild flowers, the nocturnal house and the bush foods / bush medicine demonstration."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Be respectful of the place, which has so much meaning to the local people. The stories of the wanderings and the songs is magical. Very hot, so be careful and stay with the group."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Wildlife park, with Australian wildlife native to desert area eg red kangaroos, emus, dingos, birds. Attend the bird show/talk, which had several varieties of birds flying in to display their 'talents' including falcons, wedge tailed eagle, owl and heron. A pleasant couple of hours spent walking the trails."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,One of the main attractions in Alice Springs. Really recommend this. The bird shows are just amazing. Can easely spent half a day here.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We came here on the recommendation of a friend. Really enjoyed the bird flight/talk, and just wandering around the park in the heat of spring. It had very good information signs, and we also enjoyed getting a different perspective from one of the Aboriginal rangers."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park shows a microcosm of the different habitats of central Australia. You can wander along the paths passing from one habitat to the next, stopping off at aviaries along the way. The nocturnal house is the best we've seen and leaves Taronga Zoo in Sydney for dead. The bird show, while short, was excellent and showcased the amazing ability of our birds of prey....we loved it. We would have loved to have spent more time, but were with a group and on a schedule. Highly recommended and we will definitely go back next time we are in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Easy to get to, just minutes from town by car, good amenities, great place to spend a few hours. Recommended!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited yesterday and were disappointed the bus that picked us up at 2 had to return at 4.30 which didn't give us enough time to really see the park. We saw the male bustard doing a courting dance to a female and it was a total highlight. Id never seen that before. Went to the bird show and im not sure if they were having a bad day or we are spoilt by having seen the show at healesville but that was disappointing. Would have loved to spend more time
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We really enjoyed this- scheduled showtimes for different exhibits, so you can wander around at your own pace, follow the map and join the different talks/shows as and when you want. Very informative, guest friendly and well run."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you're going to be spending time in the region and making Alice Springs your base, the desert park is an essential stop on your itinerary. Go early in your trip, later it will help you understand how life flourishes in the outback and appreciate this harsh yet fragile environment. I thoroughly recommend the bird show, the ranger was extremely knowledgeable and the birds fabulous. I've also heard the bush survival talk is worth a visit, unfortunately we weren't there at the right time. Many examples of rare desert creatures can be found in the nocturnal house, including the curious thorny devil."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The place for those without 4WD to see the centre and learn, not only fauna and flora but human history."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you are planning on visiting the Desert Park be sure to pack lunch as you will want to stay for the day. The Desert Park has something for everyone. Animals, bush tucker, plants, guided walking/talking tours and a sizable reptile house. The park is well maintained and the staff have a wealth of knowledge whip they are happy to share. There are many areas throughout the park to take a break or have a picnic in the shade. The birds of prey show is great for kids and very informative."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I arrived at this park early in the morning expecting to spend at most a couple of hours looking at some animals, then leaving as quickly as possible before the sun gets too hot. Instead, I ended up spending about 6 hours here. The reason is that there's lectures/talks throughout the day given by the park rangers. I have to confess that I had a lot of misconceptions about ""lifeless"" deserts. The talks are informative and showed just how much life and diversity there is in central Australia. The rangers are just amazing and really care about the environment we live in. Especially Doug and Matt who gave great talks about Indigenous life in the deserts, plans and kangaroos. Don't miss the nocturnal animals display, amazing watching the night animals scurrying about and their enclosures are a good size, so ""cages"" feels more humane."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Brilliant nature park filled with amazing exhibits and run by exceptionally passionate staff. A MUST see in the red centre.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A beautiful setting that allowed you to explore the nature of the area. The bird show was fantastic too.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We intended to visit for 2 hours and stayed the whole day! Excellent tour with Jeremy - so knowledgeable and friendly. Kids are still talking about the stories he told us! If you plan to visit the bird shows you must arrive 15 mins early as you have to walk to the venue and they shut the gates and won't let you in. Only downside was very poor selection for lunch and staff unwilling to prepare anything extra. The wraps we did have were excellent though. Great lunch area next to sandpit for kids.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This had everything. Really great bird show, wonderful landscape: our family really enjoyed it. The EMU show was good - laconic perhaps. Was a great introduction to the desert - wonderufl plants."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Felt it was a little overhyped - a bit expensive for just on an hour of actual tour. Probably needed better illumination to really punch it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the park as part of a group tour and were provided with an indigenous ranger; Damien; as our guide. First of all I would like to congratulate Damien on his presentation, he is a highly articulate and well educated young man who impressed with his in depth knowledge of central Australia's flora and fauna and how the aboriginal peoples used these in their daily life, for food, medicine and construction of tools. His sense of humour and good style left us all with a greater understanding of indigenous culture and of the deep affinity for the land that is part of aboriginal life. The stand out parts of the park for me were the walk through aviary, the nocturnal house and the bird of prey show, the only down side was that we were on a limited time as I could have spent all day there. I would have loved to come back at night for the guided nocturnal wildlife spotting."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"So much to see , it takes a full day! Bird show is brilliant and talks informative. Map is clear and signage informative. Staff helpful and knowledgeable. Forget the coffee!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Lovely desert gardens and great animal and bird enclosures. Kangaroos a bit disappointing but the bird flight show very entertaining and educational. Desert survival session very interesting. We were there With family on 22 degree day so able to see everything but if a 40 degree day may have been too hot to walk the whole park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We really enjoyed the Desert Park, it was a great day out and interesting to learn about the different plants and cultures etc. The bird show was great too. There was a lot of walking, so keep that I mind if with young kids or the elderly, but it was an easy walk. Just be prepared, because it is hot. Located only a few minutes outside the town centre so very convenient."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Learn how the Australian Aborigines managed to find food and live in the Outback. See some of the ways they used their different wood tools. See some birds and animals.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited this park as a part of our rail jorney aboard ""The Ghan"" from Darwin to Adelaide. Being 'bird nerds', it was great to see the birds here, both those in displays and the trained bird show. Add to that the Nocturnal display and the flora made a great visit. We will be back."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert park is fabulous, particularly an amazing nocturnal house and bird houses. The raptor flight show was great."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a terrific way to see Central Australian flora and fauna. The birds can be seen in walk through enclosures. Dingoes and kangaroos are present. Don't miss the nocturnal house, where you will see the thorny devil and bilby as well as snakes, lizards etc. The guided tour is at 1pm. Spend the day there and plan your time around the talks and the fabulous birds of prey show at 10am or 3.30 PM. Don't miss Doug's fascinating talk about Aboriginal Survival in the Desert at 11am. Other presentations are about emu, dingo,red kangaroo, sand country, woodland habitat. The park opens at 7.30 am and closes at 6pm. Last entry is at 4.30pm"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fabulous place to see the wildlife and environment of the area. Great bird show, displays are fabulous."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to take visitors. Very informative and a nice relaxing walk. Not recommended for middle of summer heat. Nocturnal section is always a hit with the kids.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert park is the best way to see all the animals that are so good at hiding in the wild. It has the most amazing nocturnal house. The bird show is very popular and for good reason. They also have an aquarium which was a great surprise to us and lots of walk in aviaries. It really is a great opportunity to learn what birds and small animals you only catch a glimpse of in the wild. A word of warning. If you have a child that is of high school age then you will need to show their school ID or they will charge you the full entry price. The lady who served us was very harsh ,bordering on rude. It seemed fairly obvious to me that our daughter is not an adult but there was no student price without proof. Other staff in the park were very nice so it is strange that they put the most unfriendly staff member to greet people entering. We were planning to have a coffee there but the cafe closes fairly early."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the Desert Park and wandered around for half a day and could easily have spent longer. So many plant communities and birds. I have been to the DP several times and still enjoy going there. I have participated in some of the education sessions - bush tucker, night animals, birds of prey - and enjoyed them all. One criticism - the cafe seems to be closed a lot of the time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Be prepared to spend many hours here. Cafe is good for lunch and the park has so much for everyone. Worth every penny spent!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A must go if in Alice. Birds and animals kept in great conditions, learn about Aboriginal culture and enjoy the views."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"For people who haven't seen the Outback fauna it would be interesting with a Nocturnal House, you can get up close to a pure bred dingo and there is a very good bird of prey display."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great first encounter with dingos, Kangaroos and other desert animals. Great birds of prey show. An amazing sunset with the McDonnell Ranges right next to it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"To start of with the flies, they're all over the place and very annoying. But the tour was well organised and we were fascinated by the stories our tour guide told. You could tell he was proud of being a native and for us it was a good ""back to the basic"" experience. Do not forget to bring along water, as it was steaming hot (we visited in January) Also the wildlife was interesting and in the park itself the animals could be seen at close hand. To experience the desert and the outback in one day: YES!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was a great day out for us. The knowledge and passion of the guides makes it all the more interesting. I would take everyone there who visits Alice Springs. Good accessibility and a nice cafe. Take a hat and sunscreen after all this is desert country.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park may seem expensive, but it's great value. You could spend the whole day here wandering around looking at all the exhibits and catching the talks and demonstrations about the surrounding desert areas and the native birds and animals. We loved the free-flight bird show. The birds are well trained and obviously love the attention and treats and it was very informative. A great educational experience to learn about outback flora and fauna."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Did the Nocturnal Tour, this allows you to see the wildlife doing what they would normally do, not stuck in cages behind glass. I must admit that walking about in almost total darkness, sounds strange. You are provided with a (Red Light) headlamp torch so that that you can watch where you are going. The two expert guides have high powered (Red Light) torches that they use to spot the wildlife. A red light, unlike white light, doesn't disturb the wildlife, but they can see it. The expert guides know their animals very well, even their different personalities. This made the tour both informative as well as fun. I didn't know that a Bilby could get Arthritis. Photography: If you are using a DSLR Camera, you will need to have a fast lens (<< f2) as well as use a high ISO. If you are intending to use a Phone, Tablet or P&S Camera, you will still be able to take good photos/movies, without using the flash (this is because these cameras already have fast lenses)."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Dingo's, Kangaroo's, Birds, and so many other animals are represented in such a positive educational way. From the Dingo exhibition to being inside the fenced area with Kangaroo's the Desert Park tour is a must visit in Alice Springs. One of the highlights of the tour is the Bird Show. When you can witness the power of The Eagle and The Speed of A Falcon you realize how important our wildlife is to nature. You also realize why it's important to conserve and protect nature. A very inexpensive way to learn about the great animals in Central Australia. If you plan it out it takes about 3 hours to enjoy all that the park has to offer, but you can go to specific tours. All in all definitely glad that I visited to educate myself on animals that are amongst us."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We flew in on lunch time and were wondering what to do before being able to check in at 3pm. We were suggested to visit this park to get familiar with the flora and the fauna of the area before we start our Central Australian trip. Would only recommend 1-2 hours and definitely catch the bird show which is on at 10am and 3.30pm each day. It was a great way to stretch the legs after a 3 hour flight and get some of the local knowledge.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs Desert Park is a popular spot to while away a few hours visiting our native fauna, flora and meeting a few of our unusual animals. Not only do you get the opportunity to walk around a lovely landscaped park - or take an open bus if you prefer - but, you'll meet some of our more unusual creatures like the Thorny Devil lizard and the long-eared Bilby. Expect to spend a few hours here and while there drop into the cafe for a quick coffee or meal. The Nocturnal House will knock your socks off. With snakes, lizards, desert mice, bilbies and other interesting creatures, it's a great place for the kids. The bird averies are equally as interesting with a range of native birds including the red-tailed, black cockatoo, spinifex and top-notch pidgeons, and more common galahs. You and the kids will love it here, but prepare to spend a few hours and in the warmer months, visit early morning to avoid the heat of the day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"An amazing crossection of dersert echosystems illustrating the soil, plants and animals of each area. There is a spectacular bird of prey show, talks by traditional owners, a great nocturnal animal display and several large averies of local birds. Most spectacular is the collection of wild flowers and flowering shrubs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is an interesting display of the plants and animals of the region. Ranger talks are very interesting.The free-bird session is excellent.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went here mainly to see the bird show and spent most of the day. It was really interesting. The shows and talks are good, the setting is beautiful and the staff are all friendly and knowledgable. The weather at this time of year is just right. It's well laid out and big but not too big So you can spend a lot of the day here but not be painfully tired at the end of it. Value for money is excellent. I saw so many animals and birds that id never seen and for someone who doesn't like zoos i thought this place was done very well. The animals have good, clean habitats that are on the most part spacious and purpose built. I would recommend this place and I'd go next time we were here, to spend time again listening to the birds. It's super peaceful out here too."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were unsure about visiting this place, but had a spare afternoon and so went there. We thought that even if it's not very interesting, the backdrop of orange-rock hill would be worth seeing. We were very pleasantly surprised by the whole wonderful place. After lunch in the pleasant cafe we started our walk around the park, keeping an eye on the clock so that we didn't miss the special talks / displays that we wanted to be at. We joined the groups at the dingoes, kangaroos, plants and birds. All were wonderful experiences. The display with the birds flying around us and down to the ground for food was amazing. We also loved seeing lots of other birds in the various large aviaries and learning to identify them. The nocturnal house showed us creatures that we would never have seen otherwise. Although we spent all afternoon there, we had to rush somewhat. All day would be good, but even an hour or two would be worthwhile."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Incredible opportunity to see the animals of the desert including kangeroos, dingos and Emus. The bird show was fabulous."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We did the night tour at the Desert Park and were able to see locally extinct animals like the Mala. Our tour guide was excellent and it was truly thrilling seeing these beautiful animals in an environment that mimicked the wild (for them) and where they were safe from feral cats etc. This was a once in a lifetime experience and I'm so glad we were able to do this.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A very well set up nature park. Loved all the aviaries and the bird show where you could see many birds close up.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great way to spend a few hours with the family. So lucky to get to pat a dingo close up!! Great aviaries, very helpful guides. Our children 7, 10 yo loved it too."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The free flying bird show is a must see! runs twice a day and the birds get CLOSE up. You will also want to catch the Nocturnal Walk after sunset. Great way to see the plant life as well as animal / bird life of the desert.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Jeremy's talk about traditional food, medicine, and tools and weapons was entertaining, interesting and informative. Jeremy is an engaging and knowledgable presenter. The park is a great day to spend a day with free talks starting at 9am each day. Be prepared to spend a few hours."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park and the free Shows that they offer were really good, however if you don't have your own car you have to book with a Company to get there since there is no public tranport going there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Have been to Alice Springs several times but this was our first visit here. You need to allow a few hours to get the most out of it. You can get a quick overview if you're limited for time but for the best experience allow some time to visit all the exhibits and to attend the various demonstrations. The park shows the various different landscape types and also has guided activities to explain more. For us a highlight was the nocturnal animals exhibit as it's rare to see these animals in the wild. Highly recommended.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We cycled to the desert park and were pleasantly surprised. This is a little jewel very close to town and well worth the time. Give yourself time to experience the whole park and time your visit to see the bird show and hear the guides talks.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This zoo is reasonable. Beautifully set out. Great staff. The bird show very good. The nocturnal house was excellent. Worth just going for these two things. Patted a dingo that was being taken on a walk. But most of the other animals are birds. If you like birds it's great. Plus not expensive. Go at bird show time, go to nocturnal. And the rest seen very quickly."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Amazing well done birds love the attention. I got some great photos blue sky and ranges in the back ground. Kids and adults will enjoy.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,very hot part of Australia it is a typical bush town in the heart of Australia met some locals very nice people
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Excellent! Revealing for all those who think there is no life in the desert. Also the professional explanation of aboriginal culture was a big value added.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Really enjoyed the park. We also did the nocturnal tour which we highly rated. The kids loved it and we saw many different types of nocturnal animals in what appeared like a reasonably natural environment.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We enjoyed the spaciousness of the whole area & the natural bird life. The Eagle feeding is a must-see.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We arrived at 8.15am on the Wanderer bus. Started with an amazing movie, then went from one guided activity to another, filling the day with fascinating experiences. The Eagle Encounter was outstanding value for money. $15 extra to meet the eagle, have 8 quality photos taken, put on a USB stick to take home, including video and info sheet. All the guides provided interesting commentary on the birds and animals. The free flying Bird Session was brilliant. Caught the bus home at 4.30pm. A day well spent. Thank you Desert Park staff for making this one our best days in Alice Springs. Not to be missed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Outstanding well presented attraction. Plenty to see with informative plaques about each area. Great cinema show.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is an expensive trip but the nocturnal tour was great. We learnt heaps about the creatures that come out at night. We went back in the day and the bird show was great. I don't think the desert park itself during the day is worth the cost ($25 an adult) unless you are a really big bird watcher.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Been in alice a few times but this was the first time we actually had time to make it out to the Desert Park. Great intro video if you can time your arrival and worth taking the time to walk around all the areas and see and read about the various flora and fauna. Worth the visit!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I truly unique experience .... Such wonderfully creative enclosures and the bird show is a must .... Very educational
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great value for money. The amount of wildlife was superb, the nocturnal set up was spectacular. Set along the back drop of the MacDonnell Ranges. Highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a fantastic place - we learnt a lot there, and it was great prices coz you could spend the entire day there. It also rained when we were there and we missed the birds of prey and they were kind enough to give us a coupon to come back the next day to see it again! Really do NOT MISS THIS!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a truly amazing place that allows you to experience all the natural wonders of Australia in one location. From snakes and spiders to desert creatures and bush tucker, the experiential approach for visitors to this park will leave even the most jaded of travelers and let's face it sometimes when it is really hot and you have traveled a long distance in a day sometimes the last thing you feel like doing is walking around a park with the family!! Don't miss this gem of an experience. It will be a fond memory of any visit into the red centre!!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The exhibits were very natural looking. The indoor ones didn't have light reflecting on the glass so it was easy to see the animals. The cages/enclosures were large. Lots of informative signs. Loved the walk-through bird aviaries. Very nice gift shop.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We spent the whole day here. Learnt much about aboriginal culture and foods as well as about the desert and its animals
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We had a couple of hours to fill in before our flight. The park is well worth the visit. The bird show was fantastic and lots of fun. Wish we could have stayed longer as there was so many guided tours to be done.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent several hours exploring this park on a beautiful Sunday morning. Critical to this 4 star review was the Bird Show which is only on twice a day (morning and afternoon) – without that show this would be a 3 star review, so be sure to organise your visit to coincide with that show. The park itself is located 10-15 minutes outside town at the base of a dramatic mountain range. Set-up in roughly a large circle, you walk through the park exploring the different animal enclosures and changes in landscape. The park is very clean and well designed – you can’t see the different structures until you are at them, with landscaping hiding things away and maintaining a feeling of exploration. While you will see all the usual Australian animals, bird lovers are in for a real treat. There are 5-6 different enclosures full of birds. The bird show I mentioned above is also extremely well done. The birds (and handlers) are very well trained with lots of close encounters and opportunities to learn about and observe a wide range of birds. The show goes for about 30-40 minutes and the kids (and adults) loved it . There is also a movie presentation which we didn’t get to and plenty of guided talks and walks. We spent two hours exploring the park but you could easily spend 3-4 if you did a couple of the talks and the movie."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"There was 15 in our group, 7 adults and 8 children and everyone had a great day. We learnt about aboriginal culture, wild birds and plants and spent much of the day wandering around the beautifully present bush. With the McDonald Ranges in the the background every spot was picturesque! Lunch in the cafe was reasonably priced and there is lots of space to eat in or outside in the sun. All the safe are friendly and full of information and are happy to stay back after a show to answer questions. Highly recommend a visit on your next Alice Springs trip and allow three hour to all day depending on your interests and walking speed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Really enjoyed the ""birds of prey"" show (make sure you're there at least 10min before show starts), ""survival in the desert"" aboriginal talk, nocturnal house, and other guided segments. Took our family good 4 hrs to visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Desert Park is must see when in Alice. The stafff and displays are fantastic. The specilas talks about the animals and the indiginous culture are presented with skill and knowledge. The Bird dislpay is magical and superbly presented.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Coming up from Melbourne on camp we thought that it was important for the students to see the animals of the desert environments. This was fantastic, especially the birds of prey exibit, which had the kids squealing as birds swooped from above. Great day out!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"In the middle of nowhere in the centre of Australias Ayres rock. A bout a day further up the road is the town of Alice Springs. The river is non existent for most of the year, just a dry dusty bed but the place is a joy to visit. The people are very nice and helpful and the history is all around. Please do not miss"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,At first I wasn't sure about this place but there is more to see than you might think at first. We went to the free bird show and that was great. The Wedge Tail Eagle was amazing. The nocturnal house was also a highlight. The bilbies were very active- so cute!!! The kitchen was closed in the cafe which was a bit of a hassle.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"we had the pleasure of being in the park a couple of months after some rain and the wildflowers were in full bloom which was amazing, we also did the night guided tour which was brilliant"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Called in here to see how the park had developed since last visit many years ago. The park is a great display of australian native vegetation and is very good to take children to learn about our native arid plants and environment. Should be on every parents list to visit while in the Alice.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"interactive, easy to get to , relaxed and interesting- diasabilty friendly. night tour and talk fun."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very interesting visit to find out all about what goes on in the desert. Lots of interesting displays of bird life including a great display of flying by birds of prey - kites, kestrels and a wedge tailed eagle. You can get picked up from your hotel as well."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The stunning beauty of Australia's wild desert oasis is Alice Springs Desert Park. Discover the unique animals and the diversity of desert plants. Admire the ancient living cultures with local Aboriginal guides.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Desert Park is a great way to see central Australia's nature without having to scour vast swathes of land to do so. Start with the highly entertaining bird show at 10.00am, and then enjoy walks and activities all around the easily walkable paths. I especially enjoyed the nocturnal house and the woodland aviaries, listening and watching birds. Staff are helpful and the attached cafe had a good coffee. It costs $25 entry, but if you are a local, that fee then gains free entry for a year. A card will be posted out to you."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"After a jam packed couple of days in the Alice, we were uncertain about whether this would be too much for our primary school aged kids. However, they LOVED it - from the nocturnal house (bilbys!) to the raptor show with eagles swooping around them, this was something not to be missed. I'd suggest looking on line to see what is on for the day and planning a 2-2.5 hour visit around what you want to see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent 5 days in Alice Springs and this would have to be the highlight of our visit. We spent most of a day here and still didn't get to take it all in. Right from the welcome by a ranger before we even stepped foot in the door, the staff were fantastic and helpful.The talks by rangers were brilliant, especially Damien, who gave a talk about survival in the desert with Aboriginal bush tucker. Being able to explore the different habitats of desert was great. The free flight bird show was amazing and the kids just loved it. It is worth every cent of the admission price"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Desert Park is well planned and a must see. It gives an insight into the way all animals live. The park is entirely wheelchair accessible which is great.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Such a diverse place. So much to see in the desert park, so many animals and natural sculptures. Well worth a visit"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Bird of prey show great and aboriginal guide interesting but tours on the programme a bit disorganised
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Had a lovely though generous lunch and a lovely coffee and followed the afternoon tours. Informative tours and lots of great pictures. The amphitheatre show was a must see not to be missed show...
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the park and thoroughly enjoyed it. I especially enjoyed the bird display but also enjoyed the aviaries ,the dingo session and the gardens. We all thought it was a very well thought out place to visit with plenty for all different ages"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very tranquil location close to Alice Springs. We had a spare day after finishing a tour and a friend had mentioned the Desert Park. We didn't arrive until lunch time and stayed until 4:30pm and that was more than long enough to walk around. Perfect spot for bird lovers. The bird show was very entertaining and informative.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park is a good way to get an understanding of desert plants, animals, birds and hardships humans face. Staff friendly and informative, The Birds of prey show was excellent, not very far from town. Entry fee reasonable and park well kept."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a place you need to spend a bit of time visiting - excellent staff & facilities a must see place when visiting Alice Springs
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The grounds were well maintained and mostly well sign posted. The nocturnal house was the highlight together with the numerous aviaries . It's a excellent way of seeing the birds and reptiles in the Red Centre at the one place and would recommend a visit.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed the visit, especially as this was a consolation prize after the tour we really wanted to go on (the 4WD safari) was cancelled due to inclement weather. Lots of nice walks, the bird show was great, plenty of animals, excellent and informative staff who all seemed to have plent of time to be helpful."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Went there with another couple, one person required a mobility scooter which cost $10 for the visit and well worth it! We all enjoyed the Desert Park which should be on every visitors 'must see' list. The displays of flora and fauna were very educational. The Bird show was excellent with free flying Owls, Kestrels, Falcons and Kites. Lunch in the Cafe was enjoyable. We left soon after the Bird show and will go there again on our next visit to Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were in Alice springs for a few days, we had a free day so we went to the desert park which had been recommended to us by a couple of friends, we didn't arrive there till 12.30 and left at 4.30. The park itself is very well kept, clean and tidy. We went into the restaurant for dinner, on the day we were there the fryer was broke so the food was limited, but what we had was good. We were only there for 4 hours this was enough for us to see everything we wanted to, the bird show was really good. This park is very good for nature lovers and bird watchers."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Wow wow wow!!! So many great things to see!!! So many different animals and reptiles to see!! And I can't even say enough about the bird show! That was absolutely AMAZING!!! So well planned. They have trained the birds so well!! It was all so unexpected! If you call into the desert park defiantly make time for the bird show! They have heaps of different birds as well! So much information to take in. And so much to learn!! I LOVED IT. Defiantly coming back!!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Arrived at 9am, and then in turn listened to passionate staff explain the history of the Aborigines, flora and fauna of the region, starting with emus, then wild birds, Matt in the sand country, Doug on Aboriginal survival in the desert, excellent lunch, back to a talk on the dingo, followed by the visit to the animal nocturnal house, finally a 20 minute film summarizing the history of Australian evolution. Left at 3 pm knowing we had only scratched the surface of what was on show. .. We will visit again,,, highly recommended if you like Australian history."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I really liked the bird enclosure and the nocturnal exhibition - you get to see some great wildlife up nice and close. Dingoes as well. I didn't do the night tour but might this trip. A good day out and educational as well.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This park really gives you a feel for the central desert and it's people. The guides are extremely knowledgable and the exhibits are sensitively displayed
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,As soon as we walked in we were made to feel very welcome. As a new-ish local this the first time I have been here. My Mum was visiting from Victoria so I took her here. $25 for an Adult and because I am a local I could get a 12 month pass included in the admission price. Excellent!!! The staff we came across were all friendly with great customer service skills! Matty was excellent! The bird show was so good! Loved it!! I will definitely be returning and I would highly recommend going along.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was in Alice Springs for a conference and a friend and I decided to check out the nocturnal tour at Desert Park. It was great. Over 90 minutes, we walked through an area where animals that only wake up at night are running free. We saw bilbies, bandicoot, mala (very very cute) - creatures that you never get to see normally - certainly not up close and personal. The guide and zookeepers were informative and friendly, and the ridge looked wonderful in the moonlight. Highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,lots of displays - really enjoyed the bird aviaries - you could see the birds running and flying around and didn't really feel like they were caged - had lots of interactive things which we didn't do because of time constraints but looks like it would be good for kids - menu at the café didn't look very exciting so skipped that -
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A large spread out display of different aspects of the area. The birds of prey especially enjoyable, as is the Nocturnal house."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were a group of 4 adults, aged from 30's to 60's and we all loved the desert park. We spent a couple of hours visiting the park and looking at the various attractions. The bird show was fabulous and we also really loved the nocturnal exhibit. I think this would be an excellent spot for anyone to visit, it's really professionally run and maintained, has a huge gift shop and we could easily have spent more time there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Really great place to visit! Such beautiful surroundings. The scheduled shows were interesting and the staff were full of knowledge. The birds of prey show was great! It gives you a real taste of being in the desert.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,There is an entry charge but worth it. Lots to see with different areas devoted to certain groups of plants. There is a birds of prey demonstration which everyone will enjoy. I saw it early in the day and it was slightly misty but still very beautiful and soon cleared.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Excellent value for money - allow at least half a day to see everything especially the Bird Show, the Nocturnal House, the Survival in the Bush briefing (indigenous culture focus)!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was a highlight of our visit to Northern Territory. This place is well run and the guides are friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable. We were hesitating if to go on a Nocturnal Tour, but this turned out to be a pinnacle of our visit: so many animals we have seen, including a little kangaroo climbing out of the mother's ""bag"" to see the world!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Hard to describe the beauty and ambience of this park, the presenters doing the talk were very proffesional and informative and being able to see the bird life up so close was great. Spent nearly 6 hours there but could have used an other day to see the bits we missed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"After the introductory film, we joined a walk, visited aviaries, then went to the cafe during a downpour, met some dingoes, visited Red Kangaroos in their pen, attended the bird show and went in the nocturnal exhibit. This place is marvelous and worth the price of admission."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Don't go here expecting to see lots and lots of animals - though you will see quite a few. I loved the ambience of the place - the efforts to replicate the environments around Alice; the bird-life both within the aviaries and outside; and the magnificent effort that has been made with native plants. Wandering through is a lovely and relaxing way of experiencing the environment - the guided talks and bird show are also excellent.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What a great experience. Loved the place and the live bird shows. The walk through bird viewing areas are spectacular and any birders will love the birds that reside in the park. Loved it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Walked in the park at 950 AM to make the 10 AM birds of prey show and made it to the entrance of the show at 10:01 Am and they didn't let us or another family in. Super disappointing. The way the times the shows are laid out make no sense ! We were watching the show about the aboriginal history with Jeremy and during his show they start the eagle show so some people left during the show to go to the other . So basically it's impossible to see it all. The coolest part about this park is being able to walk into a Kangaroo enclosure . Oh and we were able to pet a dingo because They happen to be walking them. Other than that it's just ok . Being an animal lover and one that goes to these kinds of things I wasn't impressed at all . we also did the nocturnal tour at night and it was a different experience we enjoyed it . Would recommend that over the actual park .
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Every time we visit Alice we make a bee line for this place. $25 an adult, but you can literally spend half or even a full day here. Different zones to explore: desert, woodlands, river beds. Well designed. About 2.5 kilometres of walking paths around lovely bush settings. Can also use scooters or they will drop you around if you are less mobile. Plenty of ranger presentations. Avaries well designed. We always see heaps of birds no matter what time of day we go. Plenty of parking for cars /bikes or you can catch a bus out there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We attended the Indigenous Survival talk, and the guided Nocturnal House, and looked around the rest of the site"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,It was Fun. We were fortunate in that we were able to view all 8 species in the enclosure. Staff was knowledgeable and enthusiastic . A great night :)
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My husband and I got to the park by 9am to make it in time for the first 9.15 talk, we finally left, worn out and with huge smiles on our faces, at 4pm. There is so much to see and the talks were all excellent. The highlight would be the free flying bird show-simply amazing! I would recommend that you choose the talks you most want to hear as it is impossible to get to all of them. This was extraordinary value for money and I can't recommend this park enough."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"There is plenty to see here, the guided talks are good, the bird aviaries are very good, the Nocturnal house is excellent. My wife was unable to walk much and we were unable to get a scooter for her until after Mid day so I did the leg work while she enjoyed the Cafe. We had an enjoyable early lunch there before leaving."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We come here several times a year and it never gets old. Lots to see and do, we all love the bird show and the nocturnal house. When your all done, have a snack in the cafe."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The film exploring the history of the land and how it formed was well done with the back drop falling to meet the outback view at the end was fantastic. The flora was magnificent. The only dislike I had was the small enclosure for the kangaroos.\Otherwise this as a really nice calm peaceful place to visit.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert park is fun and knowledgable, children have a great time there as do the adults. A nice cafe as well."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I visited the Desert Park in Alice Springs in 1997 just a few months of opening and to see this world class venue now was mind blowing at the least.The trees and shrubs have grown up with the massive nocturnal building is a must to see.The staff are so knowledgeable and some are aborigines who have lived of the land when they were young so they can teach bush survival techniques.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Would recommend this place to anyone visiting Alice Springs. Its a great place to learn about one of the worlds oldest culture, how aboriginal people lived and survived for thousands of years. As well as learn about many native Australian animals. Just remember to take a hat and water if you go in summer, it is a fairly large park. Thank you to everyone at the park for a great day!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Fantastic! This is a must when visiting Alice Springs. It's well designed. We were able to get up close to the Kangaroos. The bird sanctuaries are amazing. Early morning is a nice time to visit.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Go for one of the night-time guided walks in the company of a ranger. Depending on your luck, you'll see all sort of nocturnal critters that you'd never otherwise see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We were very surprised by this park. It was very well organised and set out. Very interesting talks given through out the day. Great exhibitions as you walked around. Well worth a visit if you are in the area.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My husband and I spent most of the day at the park. It was very enjoyable as well as educational. Don't miss the Birds of Prey Show as well as the different ranger talks every half hour at different locations. Damien gave two fantastic talks: one at the nocturnal house (about Australian nocturnal mammals) and one about Aboriginal survival techniques. The film at the beginning of the tour and the video in the nocturnal house should not be missed.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"went to the desert park whilst in Alice Springs, and an amazing time, this place is well worth taking the time to visit. Especially the bird show, but make sure you walk around the whole park as there are some great things to see. Highly recommend a visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Put this near the top of your list when visiting Alice Springs. Suggested visit time is minimum of 2.5 hrs, we were there for about 4 hrs. Only a short drive from the centre of town, there's plenty of parking, some under shady trees. Costs adults $25 for entry, there are seniors card concessions. Staff greeted us as we were walking towards the entrance and once inside, always nice when that happens. When you enter you are given a map and told about the park and given information about the various activities. We were there early in the day and decided to do some of the tracks and then head over to the amphitheatre for the free flight bird display. The walks are in 3 sort of areas; desert rivers, sand country and woodland and the plants and landscape of each are quite different. Good that many of the plants are labelled. There are plenty of wild birds around, but there are also about 8 good sized aviaries with plenty of central Australian birds. A couple of them are walk in aviaries. All the displays have good signage. The bird display was excellent, lasts about 20 minutes with a half a dozen different trained birds. The nocturnal house was also an excellent exhibit, just about the best we've ever seen. It was large, had easily seen animals and reptiles and had good information. All the paths were accessible, with no steep grades and were in good condition. There's a small cafe at the entrance, although on the Saturday we visited the kitchen was closed so no cooked meals were available. There's also a large gift shop at the entrance with plenty of souvenirs available."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The bird demonstration was terrific! Who knew you could train so many different types of birds to respond the way they did. Very good presentations on dingos, emus, aboriginal culture & tools. Night creatures was a bit short but interesting. The aviaries were great and it was very nice to have so many of the plants labeled around the park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Because we had an afternoon break in the Alice during our trip from Adelaide to Darwin on the Ghan, we were only permitted limited time at the park, but it was very worthwhile. Managed by NPWS, this small park had quiet a lot to see. Our guides were very knowledge and imparted a lot of info about the area and the flora & fauna. The bird show was wonderful and we were permitted to watch part of a training session with one of the raptors. Well worth a longer return visit. For those with mobility problems they provided battery operated scooters."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Make the decision to make the most of this adventure and you won't be disappointed. Take your time, listen to the talks on various animals and read the info boards available. It will help you experience the full spectrum the park has to offer and you'll come away amazed at the beauty of Australian nature. The exhibits mean you see so many animals you would rarely get to see - and the nocturnal house is one of the best in the country for diversity and display. A great day out if you want to explore Australian nature. It's not really the place for a quick look - delve a bit deeper and you'll really be rewarded. Will be back."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I really liked the nocturnal house which is better than others that I have been to, although I wasnt very impressed with the `walks' that led to a few aviaries...considering the price I wasnt very happy"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a small walk through a desert landscape with a series of exhibits, widely spaced. It also has talks every half hour. if you like the talks, you can have a wonderful day of it, going from interesting talk to interesting talk all day long. If you came instead basically to look at exhibits, you may be disappointed, as I was. There are precious few exhibits, mostly of birds, and most of the birds are of swallow size, though more colorful. Many of the same birds pop up in exhibit after exhibit. My stroll through the park took 45 minutes to see everything, though if one likes birds more than I do, and lingers more, it would take a bit longer. the only way to fill out the day, or a half day, is if you are into the talks (admittedly, as many people are)."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a must see for families. There were six of us for this day out ranging from the ages of 6 to 67. We arrived at 11am and didn't leave until 4pm including lunch. The Free Flight Bird Show was great along with the Nocturnal House. Great opportunities for photos with the stunning MacDonnell Ranges in the background. Our two children loved the day! Keep up the great work team Desert Park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Our family enjoyed this attraction so much we bought a yearly pass! This is a must do for anyone visiting Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Yes you can take off anywhere around Alice and walk through the desert, but the desert park is so much more than that. Different areas which have information boards so you can understand what you are looking at. The birds of prey show is amazing. To be able to see birds soar around you which you cannot see when they are in the wild is great. I absolutely loved the dingo show. We anticipated a hour or so at this park but it turned out to be several hours. It is much more than just a walk in the park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is an place! You actually have the opportunity to see the various creatures of the Outback in their natural habitat. There is a wonderful introductory film (approx 20 min.) that explains the history of the region which is very helpful and has a surprise ending! The nocturnal exhibit is incredible, not to be missed! Several special demonstrations take place throughout the day. We were fortunate to see the birds of prey where they actually fly over your head within inches! We also had a guided walking tour explaining the various vegetation in the Bush. All this is included in your $25 admission ticket. This was a great day!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We headed off to the Desert Park expecting to spend an hour or so wandering around however this quickly turned into an entire day out. There was so much to see and not to mention the best Nocturnal House I have ever seen. The Ranger Matt provided us with an exceptional tour. Very informative and entertaining. Would highly recommend this to everyone!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Park is interesting but what really makes it is the talks. Don't miss the bird show or the excellent bush tucker demonstration. A great way to spend a morning.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We have visited other desert parks in the NT, unfortunately this one at $25 p/p was disappointing. A tip to get some value is to grab the local tourist book ""welcome to central Australia"" as it has some discount vouchers, one being a 10% discount for this park. Ensure you get to the park around 8.30 am & listen to most of the talks to obtain value for the entry fee otherwise you will be very disappointed. They should include the nocturnal tour as part of your entry fee instead of charging an additional $44 for this night time tour."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The 2k stroll though the park is well laid out. The aviaries have a great variety of birds that you can see and photograph up close, some are behind glass and others you can walk through. They also have kangaroo, dingo, and night critters."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Too many families and their annoying kids. The park is really small and in 2 hours you can see everything. A bit pricy. Bird show is nice. Would not recommend for other backpackers.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a great place if you want to learn about how plants and animals survive in Central Australia. You should not come if you only have an hour, and be aware that it's nearly all outdoors, which in the 40-degree heat may be challenging. But if you have the time, you'll be rewarded with so much information. We drove the 9-hour return trip from Uluru to visit the Alice Springs Desert Park for a second time. The nocturnal house is worth the visit on it's own. I could have watched the Thorny Devils all day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Such a different type of park in the middle of the desert. Colours of the sand and desert animals. Was great to see.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,So many varied areas. Got a bit lost at times as I chose not to do guided tours. A visit to the cinema is a must.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a really interesting place run by NT Parks, with exceptionally talented and informative guides on hand to describe the various aspects of the desert environment of Central Australia. There is a series of presentations throughout the day at regular intervals to inform visitors about development of the desert area, the plants, trees, animals reptiles and birds, with a fascinating talk about desert survival, bush tucker and medicines. There are live dingos, emus, red kangaroos as well as a fascinating nocturnal animal house. They have a bird show a couple of times per day with kites, a frogmouth, a falcon and an owl flying free, together with a stone curlew which runs through the audience for food. Amazing. Awesome! The cafe is pretty good too. Do visit. It's well worth it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A well organized place to get a good feel of the flowers and fauna of the outback. We enjoyed all the exhibits and displays. Lots of water and shade provided too
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Wonderful friendly staff. Very knowledgeable and a great family day out!! Very interesting and only fault was cafe closed too early 2 pm when exhibits are still on for different areas. Scooters available for those not wanting a full day of walking around!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,we love this place it is so peaceful. Fantastic for overseas travellers to see the diverse plants that grow in the Australian outback
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Went here as there really is bugger all todo in alice springs. Lots of walking round in circles, they have 2 sad looking dingos, a few kangaroos and lots of birds in cages, most of which are also flying wild, so didn't really see the point. The cafe closes at 2pm so after that you have to rely on the warm water fountains . The nocturnal house and bird shows are very good though ."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Arrived at 9:30, did not leave until 5. The bird show at 10am was great, you get to see the birds up close, they fly a foot above your head.The seating is covered so you are not out in the blazing sun. Walking through the roo enclosure is awesome. In America I don't think any zoo would allow folks to walk in the enclosure with the roos due to lawyers, but here, there is no fence between you and the kangaroos. They allow you to get within 10 feet or so. We sat in on the aboriginal culture talk with one of the staff. I normally stay away from these, as they are boring and hard to listen to a person drone on. The speaker did a great job of interacting with the visitors, keeping the pace of the conversation going and providing lots of ""neat"" facts about the desert and those who call it home."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I love this place. When people come to Alice, this is always the place I recommend as a 'must do' - particularly at the start of an Alice adventure. I am a new local and it was my first port of call when I moved here. Best introduction to the landscape ever. Make sure you have a good few hours to explore - either by yourself or preferentially f with one of rangers. The rangers are a wealth of knowldge and are more than happy to share a few local secrets with you. You can get up close an personal with dingos and, of course everyone's favourite, kangaroos. The nocturnal house is world class. The bird show is highly recommended - and look out for the surprise ending in the movie, it's sure to blow your mind! It's a great place for the young and young at heart alike! Seriously, if you are in Alice you gotta check this place out!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Worth going just to see the wildlife of the outback that you would miss in real life adventures. Just love the Thorny Devils and the Bird Shows! The Bird Show is worth the entrance fee alone and like most bird shows at other zoos, this one is SUPER."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Not the most inspiring place ! Simply a fenced off piece of land with some caged birds and other local animals . Cafe closes 4 hours before the park does, bit short sighted. No guided tours despite them being advertised. Staff were friendly but it really is a lot of money for a look at something that surrounds alice and can be seen for free . I really wouldn't bother ."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As part of The Ghan railway excursion choice you can visit the Desert park some 7km from the terminal. Damian and Graham were our guides and it was so interesting. Set in a beautiful surroundings and includes a bird display which was fascinating to see, as part of the Ghan you get a special extra to see how they train the birds. Damian explained to us what the symbols mean in Aboriginal art which was excellent. There was so much more to the place than we had time for so could have spent a day there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Excellent day out within close proximity to Alice Springs. We enjoyed being up close and personal in the bird enclosures, taking our time to relax and sit quietly and let the birds come to us. We saw a lot of people did not do this, wandering through at a ""city pace"" (in and out within 30 seconds) missing many of the delightful exhibits unseen elsewhere. The free flight demonstration was superb. An easy stroll, well maintained exhibits and walkways, excellent facilities and very friendly personable staff and service all round."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Large area split into desert zones with appropriate animals and information. Regular talks by experts in each area. This was a great way to get a feel for the outback and learn more. You could easily spend a day here and well worth it.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is a kind of zoo, where you can see and be close to the typical animals of Australia like kangaroos, birds, insects, dingos, thorn's devil, etc. It so interesting to know the local fauna. Moreover, it is located near Alice Springs, but no close, so you looks like you are in the middle of nowhere. Also you can see West McDonell Ranges from Desert Park, it is a beautiful view. I enjoy a lot with the building, where there is the nightlife. There you can see a lot of nocturnal animals that you can not see in his real site. It is wonderful!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,From the moment I arrived at the visitor centre I was warmly welcomed by staff. There is lots to see and maybe it needs two visits to really take it all it. The park is quiet large with good signage and several different talks to tap into. The visitor centre is well stocked with all the usual stuff and their is a pleasant cafe for food and drink. They do a nocturnal visit every evening as well which I didn't try but there is a nocturnal house which allows you to see some amazing snakes etc if you visit during the day. All in all a great place to spend a few hours. A tip for visitors to Alice...if you go here just avoid the Botanical Gardens as they are hardly worth a visit after this place. $25 to get in and it is well worth it with the usual concessions available.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A little hot walking around but well worth it. A great day visit for Alice springs residents and visitors alike.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"For something to do with the family, its hard to beat the Desert Park. Make sure to take drinks with you as it can get quite warm out there, and its a fair walk. However its easy walking, with plenty of places to rest or sit as you go around. Taking in the shows is a must, as you can really appreciate the unique animals in Central Australia this way."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Absolutely one of the best $20 per person day trips to be had - anywhere. We have been through NSW, Vic, Qld and NT over the past 2 years & this is one of the best. Knowledgeable and friendly guides. The bird show is worth the entry fee alone."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This experience has a great raptor show and interesting nocturnal exhibit. our guide was an aboriginal and his presence enhanced our learning experience.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the desert park as a couple. We spent 25$ each for the entry. We did expect a bit more for the money. The park is pretty big, so you have to walk long distances to reach the different animal enclosures. But if the weather is not to hot, that is actually pretty nice. Nice sorrounding area and nature. There is a Dingo, Kangaroo, Emu enclosure. We didn't see any Emu, just two dingos (they seemed really exhausted and not well treated) and a few roos in a little enclosure. All bird catches had nearly the same birds, so it was a bit sad to see nothing different while watching the third and forth bird catch. The nocturnal house with all the nocturnal animals were very nice and worth to see! that is probably the best part. We really appreciate all the park guides and staff. Everybody was really friendly. All the explanations about the animals, habitats, etc. seemed very professional. The shows they offer are nice as well. We did enjoy the bird show the most. overall we would recommend it for a nice family day trip with kids. If you are a traveller just visit one of the zoos and you will see all the animals as well."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was an amazing experience. From the moment I arrived to the moment the visit finished I was treated with courtesy and respect. The information about the bilbies and bandicoots and spectacled wallabies and ........was wise and informed. Walking through the desert park enclosure accompanied by the keepers with the night sky filled with sparking stars and the sounds of singing coming from the nearby town camps was a special experience for me...one to be treasured. Thankyou.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What an interesting night. We went along to the Nocturnal tour last night at the Desert Park and it was a lovely experience with lots of opportunities to see some of the amazing native animals that come out at night. Due to the introduction of various feral animals in the region you won't get to see these animals generally, but here behind a huge double electric fence they are safe to wonder around and due to some very careful planning as you walk around the paths that wind through the bush land you can see them. On our trip we got up close with the strange looking Bilby, the cheecky bush rat (more like a large guinea pig with a tail), Marla's and several other of the smaller kangaroo type animals - can't remember their names was so focussed on the actual animals didn't really hear all of what our very informative guide was saying. About half way through our hour long walk we all had to stand very still while a very unconcerned Echinda made it way through the group of us on the path and eventually off into the bush and we even managed to see a bearded dragon asleep up in the branches of a tree - up out of the way of any snakes (which I'm glad to say we didn't see any of tonight). Our guide as great at answering all types of questions - from locals and overseas visitors alike and we even got some pointers on the various stars and how to navigate. So all you need is a pair of enclosed shoes, a water bottle and an hour on evening - the park supply infrared headlights so you can see your way once it does get dark and the guide has a really big spotlight (infrared so not to scare the animals off) and I would have liked my light to have been a little bit stronger so I could see a bit off into the bush while walking along not just a bit in front of me but still saw more than I thought I would. So here are a couple of tips - try to go on a new moon - animals more active then on a full moon, if want photos need a camera that can use at night without a flash otherwise bye bye animals. I also found that once an animal/s is spotted and the group stops just stay back a bit and squat down and stay very quiet - the spot light might be focussed on one animal but the chances are there are others and these if all is quiet will come really close to see what is going on. Overall a great experience to see what Central Australia has to offer especially as you can't get to this area during the day as it is a restricted area."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Would not have seen different animals and birds if we had not gone there. Lovely and clean rather hot but plenty of places to get shelter. May we should have gone early morning. Staff very nice and friendly
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs Desert Park is a wonderful day out. The animals are diverse. The setting is amazing, truly beautiful. The park staff are very knowledgable about the local flora and fauna and the culture of the local people. The bird show should not be missed! The park is easy to navigate and there are plenty of indoor areas if it's too hot outside. Don't skip the orientation movie - simple, but one of the best I've seen."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the park on an extremely hot day, but it was so compelling, we toured the entire site. This was one of the most interesting and informative places we went to and I left with a significantly greater understanding of the complexities of the land and animal life in central Australia"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was a bit ambivalent about visiting the Desert Park as often I experience them as disappointing and a bit miserable for the animals. However, we really enjoyed this trip as the animals and birds are in a very natural environment with loads of room for the birds to fly around and the kangaroos to hang around. It was very hot when we visited but there's a pleasant cafe and also water is accessible at various points on our walk around the park. The staff are exceptionally helpful and informative about the wildlife. We really enjoyed the day and would thoroughly recommend it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This place was a really pleasant surprise. Be sure to arrive early and attend all the presentations, which are included in your entry price. I think the first one is at 9.15 am. It's really informative about the fauna and flora of the area. They have dingoes, kangaroos, all sorts of birds and reptiles. The nocturnal section is amazing, the bush tucker presentation highly entertaining and the bird show is just exceptional. The cafe and gift shop are pretty good too! A very professionally run set up. We just spent 2 weeks visiting our son in Alice Springs and we though this was the best attraction in Alice itself. (Of course you must go further afield too - to the West MacDonnell Ranges, Kings Canyon and Uluru)."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A great family day out and would highly recommend you make the most of the day to make it cost effective for families :) A hot 38 degrees when we visited and fly nets on our hats were very successful :) The staff are really informative and know their stuff :) The free bird display was fantastic and the nocturnal centre is pretty amazing to see the protected animals too :) The cafe was reasonably priced for a sandwich and ice-cream for lunch and we enjoyed the food too :) We would certainly recommend this for a day out and the local taxi fare is around $22 each way from Alice Springs :)
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,They have done an amazing job with the variety of animals and birds on displays and adding the range of flora as well. This is my second visit and it was even better second time round.it is a great start to a red centre experience. The curio shop was very well stocked.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Went on a school trip. Staff were very good with the kids and very helpful. Being a school group we got in for free but from what I saw the entrance fee was reasonable. Cafe was very nice. One bit of advice - don't go in summer it is just too hot for walking around.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Frankly, there's not much to be found at Alice Spring Desert Park. Lots of bird enclosures, but not many other animals. The kangaroos were present but the dingos were hiding from the heat. The nocturnal house is excellent (try to attend one of the talks) and the Birds of Prey show is good fun. Otherwise... there were large gaps between the exhibits with nothing to see. The heat at this time of year (December) made it difficult to walk around. It certainly is a ""Desert Park"" because most of it is Desert. Just don't expect too much."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Set in a beautiful, natural setting it was wonderful to see such a professionally run park. So clean and fresh, the animals and reptiles live in large natural runs. Normally I don't like to see any living thing behind wire but this is the exception. Well done to the staff."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"well done and a good place to see endangered and protected animals! Try the nocturnal walk, which is a highlight!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Open range wildlife park at the foot of the spectacular MacDonnell Range. Nocturnal house and numerous walk in bird averies a particular highlight for the abundance of visible wildlife. Highly recommended visit for anyone intetested in desert flora and fauna.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This attraction is offered by our group tour operator (Overseas Adventure Travel) as an expensive optional tour. We saved a lot of money by taking a $20 taxi ride from our Alice Springs hotel to Desert Park and paid the $25 entrance fee and saved $100 for the two of us! Desert Park is a trip highlight. Be sure to see the bird show....amazing photo ops.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Staff are very knowledgeable...excellent Bird show, and wildlife easy to see. Recommend! Take lots of water"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Take the short trip out to the park to get close to various outback animals including a very close encounter with kangaroos. We caught the birds of prey show which was absolutely amazing. You may expect the big raptors but the show is all about getting close to the smaller birds like an owl and a magpie. Brilliant.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great way to get close up to some local wildlife. The nocturnal house is spectacular and the bird show is a must-see. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Definitely worth a trip.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a big park, perfectly maintained and easy to get around. The video at the start is amazing so don't miss it. The surprise ending brought tears to my eyes to see such beauty. The nocturnal house is wonderful. I never expected to be able to see these rare and endangered animals in such a wonderful setting. The Park's guide, who explained to us the traditional practice of firing the land and how this actually helps preserve the animals, was super informative. To see all the birds up close was a real thrill. Also the shop has excellent souvenirs, lots of choice and reasonable prices. A great day out."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was an awesome adventure...you'll have a great time when you are here! Something you'll remember for a while
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Really enjoyed seeing the Bilby and other creatures in the Nocturnal House. Lots of information about Australian wildlife and desert landscape. Recommend it for children very educational.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Echoing some of the previous reviews, allow plenty of time to see this excellent and informative park. We particularly enjoyed the kangaroo, dingo, bird and aboriginal cultural shows - but don't miss the nocturnal animals or smaller aviaries either. It was very hot, being the height of summer, but shady areas, drinking fountains and air conditioned buildings are strategically placed - so with water and sun screen it's still a very pleasant way to spend the day. We learned so much that would have helped us to know what to look for on our trek."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Desert Park is amazing. The bird show awe inspiring and so much to see. If you really want to take it all in you will need at least half a day. Best time to travel Spring or Autumn very hot in Summer months.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A wonderful experience with lots of birdlife and flora . The staff were very helpful, especially Matt, and we really enjoyed the Birds of Prey show and the presentation of Aboriginal culture. Allow plenty of time ( at least 4 hours ). This experience is suitable for all ages and is a must when visiting "" the Alice "" ."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We loved it here, make sure you plan to spend a good few hours here and see all it has to offer, the displays are all well worth seeing as are each of the gardens and areas .. don't miss the smaller aviaries and water gardens, there's so much to see and learn"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I remember when the site of the Alice Springs Desert Park was Buffel Grass-infested with nothing to recommend it. Whenever I visit now I am still amazed by the transformation that has taken place over the years (decades). What the visitor sees now is like looking at the real thing. And this is what the planners had in mind - to introduce the visitor to central Australia so that they could really appreciate their visit to central Australia's national parks. The habitats that have been recreated are only part of the 'Desert Park' experience. The walk-in aviaries allow you to get close to many of the birds you will see in our national parks while in the nocturnal house you will see many species that you would not otherwise have the opportunity to see in the wild. If you plan your visit there are talks by park staff on a number of topics and you shouldn't miss the free-flying birds of prey display. Allow several hours to properly see the park and don't forget the sun screen, a hat and plenty of drinking water and your camera. If you can fit it in I would thoroughly recommend the nocturnal tour. PS There is a lot of walking but there are mobility scooters for hire if you have difficulty walking."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"To really appreciate the park give yourself a full day and don't miss the birds of prey show, it is the highlight of the day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went to the park as a school visit. The staff could not have gone further out of their way to help us. Although we arrived late for the bird show, Matt went to great lengths to give us an individualized tour. The students and staff had a great day. Highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Don't miss this wonderful place. I spent over 6 hours taking in all it had to offer. Great scenery, beautiful flora & fauna and wonderful staff that explain all the different species so well. Jeremy's talk on Aboriginal life was excellent and fun. I also loved the movie with a great surprise at the end. You'll have to go and see it to find out what happens. Gorgeous Dingoes, Kangas, Emus, Birds and more. The birds of Prey demonstration was just brilliant. Put Desert Park on the top of your Must Do list."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,very well organized and the staff very friendly. I learned a lot from this place. Have a nice area to rest with food and beverages.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I visited at end of May when the weather was cool and consequently had not seen much of the wild life. This is a great place to see Australian nocturnal wild life, insects and snakes. There is also a dingo pen, and the birds of prey flying displays are fascinating. Even though it is spread over quite an area it is accessible to people with limited mobility - there are electric buggies and wheelchairs available. There is also a good cafe."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A nice place white a lot of animals there live in the territory.. They have some tours and noctorial tours
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Very well laid out display of flora and fauna. Excellent facilities and services for all. Loved the nocturnal display and bird aviary.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Excellent way to learn about the local area from very knowledgeable, passionate guides. Would definitely recommend - a must do!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"To avoid the heat of the sun on our bicycles, my fiancée and I set off to the park early, arriving at 8am. We didn't leave until 4.10pm having attended all available talks and presentations. The park keepers were all super friendly and knowledgable, always happy to answer further questions and impart extra information. Would highly recommend people go to this if they are in town."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a must. Beautiful park where u can see that the animals and birds are cared for well. We took in the free interactive bird show which is held twice daily and paid a little extra for the eagle encounter which was awesome. Rangers all seem to care very much and are passionate about their 'charges' Easy access all areas, lovely and clean and well set out."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We arrived just in time for the amazing 3:30 pm free flying bird show followed at 4 pm by a ranger led tour of the Nocturnal House, learning lots about desert animals. It contains 3 re-created desert habitats: sand, desert rivers and woodland. It prepared us well for what we would experience at King's Canyon and Uluru."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The moment you arrive the immediate thought is ""another tourist attraction"" but no, it is much more than that. I am not a fan of the typical tourist attraction however this place was very interesting with a lot going on. The bird show was educational and excellent. The walk so through the habitats were outstanding. A truly interesting and relaxing experience. More like a wildlife and fauna adventure than an attraction. Highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As a local we are members of the Dessert Park and love to take our friends and family when they visit, it is a great way to showcase the delights of the wonderful, plants and wildlife here in the beautiful red center."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great attraction for the whole family, level walking areas that are doable for wheelchairs and prams. The live bird show was the best attraction for me, with owls and kites flying around your head. Nice café area and the gift shop staff was very friendly. Also the flora throughout the park was stunning, make sure you take a hat as the area was hot and very open and exposed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As a local, my husband and I love visiting the Desert Park in Alice Springs. Over the last few months we have been taking our early morning walks around the Park each Sunday. Each season brings its own beauty, but our favourite is the wildflower season in September/October. Who knew that such beauty could be found in the desert. The different areas of the park are well set out, the woodlands, sand country and the riverlands; and within each area you are surrounded by birdsong. It's a perfect setting."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Best bit is without doubt the bird show - informative - fun for old and young alike - the birds get to do their thing(s) and we get the knowledge and information. The aviaries are also very well stocked and again if you sit watch and listen in the cages you get a very good bang for your buck. Balance of the exhibits when we were there not so much. So yes a not insignificant entry price - but one of the better attractions at the Alice.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Was a little dubious at paying $50 for myself and the missus to enter this place... After all how good could a desert park be? I'd seen lots of desert on my way to Alice! Well my hesitation was misplaced. This place was well worth the visit and the fee. The live bird show was informative but also really fun. The presenter was well healed and had his birds extraordinarily well trained. I knew that birds of prey could be trained well, but had no idea something as common as a Magpie could be so well trained and entertaining. The Curlew was also great to watch as he strode amongst the seated crowd then returned home on voice command. The kangaroo, dingo and emu interactions were basic but I guess if you hadn't been up close with these before then it would be entertaining also. The nocturnal exhibition was second to none; loads of exhibits/animals and all well presented. The aviaries were also very well presented and you could walk right into most and get up close with many of the birds. Staff were very friendly and informative and were equally happy to educate you or leave you alone which ever your preference (nothing worse than over eager staff at these sort of places and there was none of this). Overall a great experience and well worth a visit even for those who have seen a lot of the Aussie bush and it's creatures like we have."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Visiting the Alice Springs Desert Park is a bit like taking a mini-tour of several diverse parts of Australia's outback. The design of the park is separated into different vegetated communities - so you meander around easy walking tracks the different plant (and often animal) species you are likely to encounter in each landscape. The Park is thriving and teeming with healthy vegetation - keep an eye out for the signs explaining what the various species are and how they are used. It is an outstanding education facility but is also very enjoyable - the nocturnal house is amazing and a wonderful reprieve from hot midday sun. I have always been disappointed not to have had a whole day at the Park - the shows are scheduled throughout the day but usually only one scheduled time for each so I have never been able to get to all the talks/shows. To give yourself the best chance, perhaps get there early just after opening time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A really well organised and run park. We were thrilled to see Aboriginal people involved. The nocturnal exhibit area was brilliant - as was the bird life. Be sure to see the cinema exhibit before you wander around the park. We paid extra and had the pleasure of the eagle experience! They're doing a brilliant job with their eagles.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A senstive development (minimal impact on the environment) that showcases various local flora and fauna in a well-planned layout. Enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff too! Highlights included a presentation on local Aboriginal bush tucker and a bird display/show (with an excellent presenter and well-trained birds). I'd recommend visiting in the morning (to avoid the heat of the day) and to take your time enjoying the exhibits and talks. Cafe on site.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I spent about 4 hours at this extraordinary outdoor museum, observing the birds, nocturnal mammals andreptiles and kangaroos. The number of species present is very large and I saw many animals I could not have seen otherwise. The displays are very visitor friendly and the setting of the riverine, grassland and other environments are well maintained. There were several shows I would have love to see but I didn't realize that I needed a whole day here! Warren Fish"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very enjoyable experience, saw red kangaroos, dingos, nighttime animals and the birds were fantastic. So many species. We sadly missed the birds of prey show. Spent about 5 hrs there walking around the lovely grounds. The food In the cafe was good. The ticket price was not to bad."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A wonderful day learning about the desert reptiles, animals and bird Iife, so much life in the desert, the nature theatre a wonderful learning experience the park is easy to navigate and the different bird sounds I'd never heard before were wonderful, the nocturnal house another must do, definatley worth doing."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Desert Park presents the habitats of the Desert along with the creatures that belong in the habitats. I was there for the Alice Springs Bird Festival. Where else in the world can you learn how to birdwatch, see the birds in the park, then go out into the desert knowing what you are looking for with an idea of the habitat. It was brilliant."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Opens at 7, so you can go in really early and make the most of your day Loads of local animals - namely cangurus! (which we had not been able to see in the wild) A zoo that makes sense, because it shows off local animals, local habitats etc instead of keeping poor animals trapped in an environment that is not their own. Also the cangurus for example were in an area where you could walk in ie they weren't in the other side of a fence."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We spent all day here. Two adults two children. We attended all the guided tours with the exception of the 930 survival in the desert talk which we just missed. Our favourite part of the park was the Nocturnal House. Most impressive. The place is well looked after with welcoming staff It's good value for a family day out especially if you love Australian flora and fauna. I'd recommend going if you are new to the area and don't know much about the landscape etc. Also try to avoid too hot a day.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Well set out and maintained. Give yourself enough time there though. We allowed 2.5 hours from 2pm to catch the 3pm bird show but ran out of time for our 4.30 bus which was a shame. The bird show is not to be missed. Nocturnal house is also really well done.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Heaps to do, check the times of the birds of prey show, dont miss it! Stroll around if you have good company to chat to, and make sure you get go at least part-way on a guided tour. Guides here are passionate, like all we came across in central Australia. There is a movie with a great ending, especially later in the afternoon...Note: Cafeteria limited food options."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the Desert Park after a ten day-trip down the Stuart Highway and into the West MacDonnell Ranges, and still it was an excellent visit. The botanic garden is not that interesting after seeing the landscape on our trip, but there are a few things that make the (not quite cheap) visit worthwhile: - the nocturnal house: vast exhibition, many animals that you would only hear in the night in the Outback and have a chance to see there, also some animals that do not survive in the wild any more due to introduced predators such as cats they are not prepared for. - the bird of prey show: Great! Living in Europe, we have seen many of these shows here, but never anything like that. It was a true choreography of birds flying on and off and right over our heads, and it was funny and interesting. - the staff: The staff was incredibly friendly and made sure everybody was aware of the different shows and talks that held place, and they also walked around the park and stopped by for a few minutes just to explain to you what you were looking at. That way, we learned a great deal more about the animals then we would have just reading the signs. Note: Bring enough water. There are drinking fountains in the park but much of it is in plain sunlight (not the bird show, though)."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Had a great dinner there last week with a heap of ecological friends. Perfect weather. Stars everywhere :)
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This naturalistic park has loads of educational information about the local plants and animals. Birds and animals seem to have good, naturalistic environments with enough space. They have several special demonstrations during the day. The free (as in loose) bird show was awesome - owls, kites and magpies swooping through the audience and the kerlew (a ground bird) literally walked through the audience, within a couple of feet of each person. Extremely well done, and amazing naturalistic animal training. The nocturnal display was also terrific. An excellent experience!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park came highly recommended from our hosts in Coober Pedy and also in Alice - at both places we were told, ""if there is one place in Alice you must see it's the Desert Park."" And this is terrific advice. We suggest go early in your stay so you learn and appreciate more the beauty of central Australia. The staff were excellent, knowledgeable and happy to answer any and all questions. Rangers Jeremy, Matt and Krystle were brilliant. Make sure you see the bird show. The cafe provided a great lunch at quite reasonable prices (no eftpos). There is such a variety of birds with great aviaries and the funny thing is when you walk out of an aviary there seems to be as many birds outside as well. The kids are still talking about this place. There only suggestion to the park is to try and exhibit: 1) Frilled Necked Lizards & 2) Blue Tongued Lizards :-)"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"They wanted $25 entry,which seemed to me too expensive,to walk in the bush.there's nothing to see.The staff are far from helpful,there was a blackout,so they kicked everybody out.To save myself anymore rubbish from these unhelpful people,I just asked for my money back.I think they need some customer training."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"had a great time, you need, in my opinion at least half a day to really enjoy all the park has to offer. Jeremy was our host at the bird show and it was amazing and the birds wander around you ! Jeremy was our host for the kangaroo talk and his insight into the culture added even more showing us the implements used. the kangaroos were really up close to us and not at all behind fences. On to the nocturnal house which is a real highlight and incredibly well set out.The park is well marked out and easy to negotiate with lots of water stations along the paths. Really impressed with the little scooters that are available for those that need them. The gift shop had lots of souvenirs at good prices. This was a great day and really terrific value ! if you can its a must do ! Thank you for a great day , there is so much to see here !"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic setting, well laid out tracks with ""stations"" to stop at. Beautiful flora also. Bird show was great."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Plan to spend half a day here. Very very good . They have done a wonderful job displaying the different animals and plants of the desert outback. Requires quite a bit of walking but we'll worth it. We spent about four hours here but could have stayed longer--that interesting.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The park is very well laid out and easy to navigate. There are mobility scooters available for those who can't get around as well as they used to. The nocturnal house is particularly well done and very interesting. We wish we had allocated more time to see all the shows throughout the day. Next time we come through Alice Springs we will spend the whole day there.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As so many others have said, the AS Desert Park is well set out, well presented and delivers some wonderful experiences. The bird show is excellent and the ""stage magic"" behind the presentation is very slick indeed. On the whole, the ranger talks are excellent, though there are some that will improve with experience and some gentle in-house counselling. The cafe is a pleasant place to take a break but there is a gap between aspiration and delivery. Don't expect that the range of food and snacks you might expect from the advertising will necessarily be available when you are there. Above all, allow enough time in your visit to relax in a shady spot and simply contemplate the extraordinary environment around you."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"loved the 'Aboriginal Survival' presentation by Ann, very informative, interesting and funny. I only had the morning there so was a bit rushed, would have loved to come back for the Nocturnal Tour that night but as there was no shuttle operating at night had to give it a miss. Park is well presented and all staff friendly and very helpful"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My husband and I spent three entertaining hours at the Alice Springs Desert Park. Our tour guide Damien was absolutely fantastic! He was informative and humorous sharing his aboriginal knowledge. In the nocturnal house we were given an insight into the animals we would rarely see throughout the day. The wild bird show was excellent far better than the Bird Show we had seen in Dubai the year before. My best memory of the park was after the movie was shown explaining the geographical formation of the area, the screen slide down and through the glass we could see the real West MacDonnell Ranges in their exquisite beauty. A fabulous place to visit when you're in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent a wonderful three hours in the Park, with local guide, Damien. He was informative and articulate, with a great sense of humour. We were a large tour group and must have been difficult to keep together and communicate with, but he managed most successfully. He talked about the vegetation, wild life, bush food, where to find water and the local Arrente people. We went into the nocturnal house, a beautifully set up museum of wild life, and then we watched a presentation of live birds! Well worth a visit when you get to Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Awesome. Great place nice walk, great birds, Roos, trees and flowers. Give yourself an hour or 2. I would recommend it for sure."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,great first stop in the outback to learn about the environment and the Aboriginal people's interaction and relationship with it. Take one of the free guided walks and dont miss the free flight bird show
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Loved, loved this place. The birds are great and the interpretation brilliant. If you are travelling with young kids, make sure you bring a pram as the site is huge and there is lots of walking. Also bring a hat and heaps of water."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I wish I'd had more time at the desert park- I had 1.5 hours. I really enjoyed the free flying birdshow. The ranger had trained a number of native birds and they were flying and walking all around us. There was also an aviary with lots of birds and they are not afraid, I got a good photo of some wader birds and saw some birds that looked like budgies!! I'd love to go back and see the night show."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Take your time and truly enjoy this place as I did, it is simple and unpretentious so don't expect a safari. The earphone tutorial was very good. Probably cost more for what you get but I think it was worth it for the good work they do."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A pleasant walk -especially with a ranger. You will learn loads, see a lot of things you would never notice otherwise and come close to the animals you would never just stumble upon otherwise. The best part was the bird show. Hands down. No trained animals, they simply learned when to show up for a free meal. The ranger again was fabulous, loads of infirmation and a great respectful hand with the animals."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I would like to extend a big thank you to Damian who was excellent with his guided tour. He was very knowledgeable and made the visit fun and enjoyable. Again an experience I will never forget.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Even if you have had an extensive trip about the region, this is very much worth the visit as it shows so much more wildlife, especially birds. The park contains habitats, plants and animals found in the central Australian desert within about a 600km radius of Alice Springs. The nocturnal house is very good as it not only allows viewing of the marla and bilby but also allows viewing of other animals (Thorny Devil for one) that are difficult to find in the desert. It also has a few snakes that are best viewed here rather than in the wild! There is also a resident perentie worth seeking out and the free-flying bird show in the amphitheatre is a way to get up close to a few local birds. There are numerous aviaries scattered about the park and each contain a number of species of birds native to the area so this is an easy way to see these birds without having to tramp around the desert. As it was close to spring we luckily saw patches of wildflowers starting to bloom and add colour to the area. Although we didn’t spend nearly enough time there, what we saw was well worth the admission. If you plan to visit allow at least half, if not a full, day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited the Desert Park and spend half a day there. It was interesting and fun. If you like to learn more about the desert. The bird free flying show if definitely recommended. Have fun in the desert and learn something too.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Enjoyed a few hours wandering through the park and its environments. Was taken on a trip back to my childhood when I heard the 'did you get drunk bird'. Access east to all parts of the park. Get there early and be prepared to spend the day to see it all.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great place, we enjoyed a full day, taking pictures of all the birds . The bird show was fantastic and should not be missed"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"On any other day it would be in the VG or Excellent rating but I have one major complaint. For the admission price ($25) I must admit I expected a lot more. The presentations & activities sound (and would be if you saw them) great !! The problem was I visited after 2pm and the only activity left was the bird show at 3:30pm & desert animals at 4pm ?? To compound this the other areas (plus those to come) were closed to the visitor.This left only all the bird aviaries & the nocturnal house as the only exhibits open plus the nice walk through the woodland, sand country & desert rivers sections ! Which I still enjoyed but felt ripped off never the less. I can't imagine how the family in front of me at the cashier felt after their $89 fee ?? Sorry to seem so negative but it needs a real good think as to how they present what is a great product to the Paying Public !! As to the Eagle Encounter ? Save your money & see them in the wild on the Stuart Hwy, Lasseter Hwy etc for free, Ah, Nature !!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you want to see a range of desert animals that come out at night in natural surrounds, the nocturnal walk is a must-do. Truly a great experience no matter how old you are."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Well designed park that allows you to see bird life up close, the noctural house was impressive, also many of the desert plant life on show and the bird show was fantastic."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you are ever in Alice Springs go here. It is interesting, plenty to do, lots to see, very educational. The noctarium is especially good."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert park is an excellent tourist attraction and also holds good community activities. The nocturnal house is very interesting, the introductory film should not be missed - stay to the end and the different habitat walks provide an indication of the habitats of central Australia."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I absolutely loved the place! Spent some 5 hours there, and would be happy to stay longer, except it was closing time. Aviaries are superb, so is the nocturnal house, the bird show was great. All in all, firmly among my top favourite places during Australia trip. Not so many animals - just dingos and kangaroos (except in the nocturnal house), but birds absolutely lovely, and the overall impression best possible."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I really enjoy to see and know about the animals it's very organized too! The willife is amazing! The people ther are very nice and if you need some information about places to eat for example they help you too!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We stopped here for a few hours on our first day in Alice Springs. It is located just outside of town in a beautiful location, so even the walks between exhibits are nice. The nocturnal house was definitely the highlight, as it contained many rare animals you are not likely to see in your time in the Red Centre. For those that are interested, there are also a lot of wild birds on the grounds, so it is good for birding as well. We had lunch at the café, which was rather basic but a good way to fill our stomachs. Definitely a good way to pass a few hours in Alice Springs, especially if you are interested in the native fauna."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"My friend and I recently visited the Desert Park in Alice Springs. It is an excellent attraction and one could easily spend the best part of a day there. We only had three hours to spend, but wished we had more."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A quick way to see all the desert critters - but do ensure you have 4 hours to visit and that you see the bird show.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We did the nocturnal tour. So you're walking aroung in the dark and you hear a lot of noices in the bushes, but we saw only very few of the animals. It is understandable that only the guide has a poweful light, but this ends up that you're always following the light in order to catch some short views on the animals. It is not really an experience of the nature"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The bird show is a must and the walk around was very informative. We were lucky as the wildflowers were out and this made the ground very pretty also.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,An interesting introduction to the landscapes and animals. I was concerned that some of the enclosures are too small. Especially for animals that roam large distances.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A visit to the Desert Park is a great experience for all the family and a good way to keep the kids entertained away from those screens. A must see is the wild bird show which is as educational as it is entertaining.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Not what I expected.... Did like the ""Dingo ""show though. The gift shop is good. Would be great to take children to. Thought there would be more animals."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Because we were going to do the 6 day Larapinta trek the next day, we spent the who day at the park to try and absorb what we could of the birds and plants that we would see. The bird show was excellent, the staff knowledgeable, the price very reasonable, the interpretive signs well done, the shop had a big range of good quality goods, including reference books. The birds in the aviaries were easy to see and photograph. We spent the whole day there and had lunch in the cafe. The nocturnal house was the best that I have ever seen and I've done a few around the country. We even came back in the evening to walk through the enclosure and saw several rare and threatened native animals roaming around including the mala, the bilby and the stick-nest rat."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very well laid out and organised. We got there for the 9am indigenous talk by a very capable lady guide. The bird show is a highlight and should not be missed. Make sure you visit all three bushland type areas, every one is different and important if you are to get the best out of your visit. We were there mid-August and the weather was cool but very pleasant. No flies! Be aware that you are able to come and go from the park during the daylight hours of your day ticket."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This lovely park gives the traveller a wonderful insight into the fauna and flora of the great Australian outback. The aviaries and nocturnal houses are fantastic. It's a great way to see the wonders of nature in a well designed and eco-friendly environment.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Friendly staff, shuttle from my hostel. Enjoyable park you can do in half day, interesting shows (birds, aboriginal)"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I liked the natural enclosures for birds. The layout of the gardens and information. The nocturnal display was also excellent.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I had low expectations, but enjoyed my visit, especially attending the birds of prey show (excellent - the various birds and the keeper sure put on a great show - everyone enjoyed it). Plenty of bird display areas, and the nocturnal animals display area is also very good. And the birds, reptiles and animals are clearly well cared for."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park is just amazing and my teenage kids were enthralled with the wildlife, the scenery, the engagement and the setting"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We'd taken the Alice Explorer transfer bus at 7.30 am and planned to return on the first available bus at 12 noon, thinking that would be plenty long enough. In the end we came back on the 2.30 bus. From 9.00 there are regular talks in different pars of the park - about bush tucker by 2 indigenous guides, about desert birds, about red kangaroo and about dingos. The guides were all friendly and knowledgable. It was an unexpectedly enjoyable morning!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was an excellent place to visit in Alice Springs, don't miss it! Make sure you head in early, as soon as they open, because there is lots to see and do, and you don't want to miss out! We arrived at 2pm, so only had two hours (and i still found it fantastic!), but managed to walk around most of the park, have a guided tour of some plants and animals, see a bird show, and a tour of the nocturnal house. The bird show was certainly a highlight, held in the park at the base of the McDonnell Ranges, it's a spectacular location and an entertaining show! All of the staff we encountered were incredibly helpful and friendly. One staff member (I wish i remembered his name!) even came to find us at around 4:15pm as he knew our bus was leaving at 4:30pm and didn't want us to miss it! When we mentioned we hadn't yet seen the nocturnal house yet, he took us on a quick whirlwind private tour of the highlights so we could still make it for our bus! He was amazing!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a wonderful time here. Lovely grounds, vey informative shows, just wish they timed them better. Fabulous animals to see up close."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As a local I can access the benefit of a yearly pass. This place is a wonderful oasis in Alice springs and we are lucky to be able to utilise it. Catering for bird fanciers, plant lovers, animal lovers and people wishing to learn more about Alice's landscape, you could spend a whole day here. The bird show is wonderful and on twice a day, the afternoon ( unsure about morning) bird show is followed by a guides nocturnal house talk. Gift shop and coffee shop along with good toilet facilities make this a nice day out. I only wish they gave bush food talks more often."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We missed the timing to participate in the presentations but the wildlife was spectacular and and obvious must attend attraction ...probably on of the best . Make sure you find out when the various presentations are on so you don't miss out ..especially the raptor display.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Worth the visit - with the bird and kangaroo sessions a real treat. Learnt a lot about the desert animals and their habitat. Staff very friendly and encouraging your questions.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Found the staff to be very passionate about what they do. I learned a lot on my visit, and really appreciated the opportunity. I recommend the walking tours and other organised activities."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was a little skeptical when the desert part was suggested, I mean I was in a desert, what else could there be? So much. This park is a great introduction to the plants and animals in the outback. It will like be the only place people can see the nocturnal animals and get up close and personal with a kangaroo - well not tooo close :) Don't miss the outdoor flying birds show."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,What an amazing place. Found out so much about our native flora and fauna. Allow plenty of time; don't rush this is a wonderful interesting place.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"At $25 a head, it's pretty expensive just getting in. The park itself is not huge ( at least the walking trails between attractions anyway) although it is beautiful with wild flowers in July when we visited. The nocturnal house was an unexpected surprise - absolutely huge and really well designed - could have stated here much longer an we did. They have ""talks"" at various enclosures during the day but there are long waiting periods between each so not sure what you could actually be doing if you wanted to experience them all. The cafe is fairly basic and is cash only so this could be an issue for some travellers."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You MUST get to the bird show and sit down the bottom. There is a lot else to see, more than you think, and it will take time especially if you want to attend the rangers talks which are good. It is well set out and not too busy and I got a discount for the bus and entry, I think ,by going in the afternoon"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Acres of native vegetation and animals which can be viewed close up. We visited the Desert park before going bush which was really helpful in getting a handle on some of the things we might see in the bush. The nocturnal house is very impressive and so was the bird show. The Dingo display was not great I felt sorry for the two dogs on display in a very exposed yard. The shop sells excellent examples of Hermannsburg painting at very reasonable prices as well as the usual tea towels and tinnie holders. The staff at the Park are very informed and happy to share knowledge. The one draw back I could see at the Park was a very ordinary café which is not being run to its capacity. The setting demands a really great food outlet where you can get good café grub and a good coffee. The Park opens early in the morning and it is a good idea to go early to see the animals when they are active.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park is open and easy to walk around. Loved the nocturnal house! Saw the bird flight show, found it a bit difficult to hear the speaker and thought it could have showcased more birds (but you have to pay extra for an up close encounter). Great morning."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Excellent gardens (well tended and labelled with informative displays), good walk in aviaries however several of them have the same birds (thats minor though). We saw the red kangaroo talk which was informative and got up close, kids seemed to love, and a dingo roaming freely as we drove in. The nocturnal exhibit was surprisingly large and really well done, we saw all the little native mammals, geckos, snakes etc. Its quite a big area so could easily fill a couple hours to a half day (depending if you go to all the talks which seem to be staggered early in the morning, or late in the afternoon ie there is a big gap between 1030am and 130pm). If you only have time in Alice to see a couple of things, or dont have much chance to get out on the road, I'd rate this highly as its a snapshot of the desert animals and plants in a well done natural setting. The staff are helpful (to the point of telling you ""now you will go here and see this""...but you can do your own thing or spread out as you prefer."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park is nice, but it's mostly birds on display. They have a fairly new dingo enclosure, a kangaroo enclosure, and a nocturnal house. (There might be an emu enclosure, but we didn't see any emus.) If you go, don't miss the bird show as it's the highlight of the park during the day. We also did the night tour. This is fascinating. The guides spread food along the path just prior to the tour, so it ensures there are plenty of animals about and close to the path. Do not book too far in advance. I booked about a month prior to going, and my booking had everything wrong. First off, there is no reservation reference number or confirmation email given. When I showed up, the person at the desk told me they didn't take reservations. Someone from the office came out so I could explain, and then I learned that the reservation person was at the bank. Fortunately, they let us in, resolving to figure out what had happened. I got a call when the person returned from the bank saying everything was fine, we just needed to show up that evening for the night tour. Once again, my name was not on the list. Fortunately, the guide had seen our paperwork at some point during the day and thought it just didn't make it to the night list."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Nice place to visit, the best movie room ever...spend at least half a day here....the bird show is good. Great photo opportunity moments in here..."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great bird show, fantastic informative day we learnt alot and really enjoyed it. The talk by Allison was fantastic"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I did not expect much, but was really surprised at the quality of the exhibits, from plants to birds and animals. An excellent live bird show is superb entertainment."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"On our park ranger guided walk we saw native plants, animals and birds and learn a little of how aboriginal people lived. The bird show was fun, with the ranger giving hand signals as she spoke and the birds flying within our arms' length. We learned how the aborigine used things found in nature to survive. We did not meet any aborigine."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Good for study trips but boring for adventure group. Very informative but little physical contacts with animals.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great opportunity to learn about the flora and fauna of Central Australia. The nature theater presentation is a must see, the birds are amazing. The nocturnal house was another highlight for us, especially seeing the malas."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Loved everything about this park. The walk-in bird aviaries, the changes in desert landscapes... made it feel like we were really walking all alone out there. The Bird Of Prey show is an absolute must - the people that work there are really passionate about the animals and the park. Worth a look."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The bird show is a must as it is so informative and you do take away knowledge of species which you see as you are travelling in the desert. We went in May and it was a quiet day which made it very peaceful walking the grounds. The ranges in the background make for some great pictures and make you feel you are in the desert not close to town.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was probably a little disappointed in the outing however we did stay there for 3 hours. The nocturnal exhibit was excellent but other than the bird aviary the rest of the exhibits were a little on the small side. We watched the dingo presentation which was good but probably only lasted about 15 minutes so was a bit short IMO. The park is set up with a heap of meeting places for ""talks"" which are useless as our program only had 2 talks on for the day and neither one was within the time frame we where in the park. Its good to visit and the $25 entry fee is probably what it is worth. It does seem they have some big plans and will expand in due course."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Damien's cultural experience was fun and interesting. The bird show was also very good. We learn't lots of things and we will use them if needed.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you love nature undisturbed you will love this place, fantastic walk through aviaries and nocturnal display, even as you walk along the path there are finches & lizards darting past you all the whole time. We went in the middle of the day which meant not many people there, easy to do in winter! the weather was beautiful, busses arrived as we were leaving early afternoon!! The entrance fee is very good and well worth it for what the park offers. With the MacDonald Ranges in the background you just can't take a bad photo."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited as part of The Ghan off train tours. We had a guided walk through a variety of areas that take in a great cross section of flora and fauna in Central Australia. The guides were friendly, informative and we found out a lot about lots about the bush even though we have visited central Australia a few times now. I cannot comment on the price as it was part of the Ghan train package but my wife and I really enjoyed the relaxed environment. We were not expecting a theme park and thankfully did not get one! Take your time and experience the animals (Rory the wedge tail eagle was a highlight), the bush tucker as well as Aboriginal Art explained by an Aboriginal with some great stories and lots of humour. Highly recommended to everyone before you go bush so can better experience and respect a great part of Australia. If you want a theme park give it a miss and you wont feel the need to write silly negative Trip Advisor feedback!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Saw lots of animals which I was so pleased about, knowing nothing is guaranteed with animals but then I found out that just before the tour they put feed out to ensure we get value for money. Saw all of the promised animals although the bilby was being very elusive. Everybody is issued with a headlamp to wear which is set to red light to minimise disturbance to the animals. Really the lamps were far too weak to do much more than allow you to see where you were going and you had to rely on the guides to shine their much stronger torches where you wanted to look. I would have liked a few of the better torches distributed through the group as there were many times when there were more animals around than the one the guide was spotlighting. And we were lucky as we had two guides and therefore two torches. I get the impression there is usually only one guide. Having said all that, the tour was a wonderfully different opportunity to see wildlife in its native habitat so well done to Dessert Park for coming up with the idea."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited on our first afternoon in Alice Springs and were delighted with the experience. The free flying bird show was excellent and the nocturnal house was well worth spending time in, letting your eyes adjust and then seeking out the animals. The aviaries were very lively and we were so impressed with the signage and descriptions of the flora and fauna that we bought the guide book as a souvenir. It was very handy as a field guide throughout our trip over the next week. We would definitely recommend a visit here."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Various desert landscapes recreated and there were informative displays about each one. We only had 2 1/2 hrs, but longer is needed to really have a chance to read all the information and listen to the talks and demonstrations. This not a zoo, but a reflection of the wildlife found in the area, so there are a lot of bird displays. The birds were active and easy to spot. Same with the animals in the nocturnal house, as well as the kangaroos and dingoes. The free flying bird display was amazing. Can't comment on the other talks as our short time frame.unfortunately didn't give us time to attend these. The one disappointment would be the cafe being closed even though it was only 4:15pm when we were there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"When we were first dropped here we wondered how we were going to fill the five hours until we would be picked up, however there was plenty to see. Loved the wild flower displays and the bird aviaries."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great place to spend the day. In fact we could have spent a lot longer there. The talk on Aboriginal foods was very informative and we found some foods that we had never heard of, such as the Bush Coconut."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to visit. Priced reasonably and great shows. Best to bring your own food as cafe is limited and doesn't except efpos.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"That's what people have to remember, this garden is in the middle of the desert so with that in mind this is a very interesting garden and take in the work that was involved to bring it all together. It really is quite an achievement."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a beautiful place to visit to get a sense of the wildlife, yes, there is wildlife, but because of the extreme temperatures in Australia, the wildlife is some times hard to see. There are amazing creatures if you spend the time and don't go through at a fast pace. The nocturnal house is one of the best I have ever seen. In addition to the animals, there is a wonderful array of plant species. For me, this place, is the essence of the Australian desert. Plants that have adapted to the conditions, animals that have also adapted, all in one place. It is for those who appreciate nature and the uniqueness that is Australia and its landscape. Not for those who want bling!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We arrived fairly late in the day, so unfortunately we had missed most of the events that are on, however we were lucky to catch the free-flying bird of prey show. It was absolutely magnificent, with a very knowledgeable keeper presenting the birds and demonstrating their various techniques of flight and hunting. The birds themselves were astounding and it felt like a great privilege to be so close to them as they flew over the top of the audience. Aside from the birds of prey we also enjoyed the reptiles and the nocturnal house was a highlight too. The nocturnal animals were really active in their dark enclosures, but there is still enough light for visitors to enjoy watching them. I felt glad to be there late in the day so there were no crowds around as I watched these animals. The other outdoor exhibits though were nothing particularly special as an Australian, however I'm sure for overseas visitors the opportunity to walk through the open kangaroo enclosure would be a highlight. I don't normally have much interest in gift shops however I do have to say that the gift shop at Desert Park is very good. There are many Central Australian artworks and paintings available at very good prices. Not all the paintings were the best I've seen in the area but some of the artists are excellent, and this shop is known for ethical practise in selling indigenous artworks. To any visitors to Desert Park I would say don't miss the birds of prey show, and I would also recommend once you have been to the Desert Park drive on a little further to Flynn's Grave where the Mt Gillen walk begins (although it is not well sign-posted - you do have to know it's there) as this excellent walk will make a great finish to your day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Our visit to the Desert Park was a highlight of our time in Alice. We missed the bird show which was unfortunate however there was more than enough to catch our interest. Fauna and flora was well labelled making it easy for us to identify what we were looking at and grasping some understanding of the relationship between the natural world and the first human inhabitants. A personal highlight was the nocturnal house - and it was cooler which was a massive bonus. We would like to revisit at a cooler time of year and linger longer next trip.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A good place to spend a few hours while in Alice. Of particular note is the bird show. Make sure you set up to visit to see one of these. They are in the morning and afternoon and quite an amazing show. The rest of the park is nice to walk around with a good nocturnal centre, I would leave about 3 hours for this activity."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The guide was full of interesting information. We came away with a good understanding of the people of the Australian desert and how it shaped their lives.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,An excellent depiction of the bird and animal life in the different desert habitats. The windows on to different birds and animals give you a great view of them without them being aware of your presence. The nocturnal house was amazing and requires a good amount of time to see all the life that is there.. It's good if you can visit some of the shows but we had limited time and missed a number of worthwhile shows. A place to spend a good amount of time to learn more about the land around you.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This place is excellent. Depending on the time of year you are visiting it would be wise to check ahead for the times of the various shows. The aviaries are fantastic, we got some really good photo's and the nocturnal house is absolutely world class. Do spend some time there, it is worth it. We missed a number of shows due to our schedule so advise as others have to spend a day or more. Overall, Excellent!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Would recommend a visit to this nature park without hesitation. we took international visitors and we all loved it and learnt a lot. Spend a while so you can walk through the aviaries as well as catch the Free Flight bird show. A guided walk through the nocturnal house is recommended as the guide uses an infared spotlight to point out the animals. We were nearly caught out with the café closing at 2.30 when we needed a late lunch - there was not much left to choose from.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Amazing attraction more than just a touristy place. Very informative and you will never view deserts the same way after this experience. Well set out easy walking trails and very knowledgeable staff. On entry a timetable is the most valuable asset relating to events during the day. We spent hours here and thoroughly enjoyed the time spent taking in the flora and fauna.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,It would be very difficult to see it all during the warmer months! Great potential - good to see the new Dingo exhibit
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The slogan says: You will never view deserts in the same way again. And how right it is! Desert sands, desert rivers and woodlands. All landscapes are represented in this open air park. Flora and fauna in their native habitat were remarkable. We checked out the daily timetable and moved from one event to the next eg The bird show (magpies, barn owls, birds of prey etc) all flew in on queue. We had lunch at the cafe and enjoyed the whole day. There was so much to see and do. The cinema show was magnificent ending with the screen lifting to reveal the natural landscape of the MacDonnell ranges. Two special mentions:the Aboriginal lady who presented survival in the desert and the knowledgeable guide in the wheelchair who introduced us to the park and did the kangaroo and dingo lecture. Be sure to book the Alice Wanderer bus which provides transport to and from the park and entry to the park for a reasonable fee."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic attraction that is well laid out and very informative. Allow a minimum of 2 hours to walk around and enjoy this park. Time your visit for the bird show, it is brilliant!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a fantastic day at Desert Park, learning about the fauna and flora of the western desert. The wild bird show is a must, as is the nocturnal house which allows you to see those shy animals not normally visible during the day. We loved the bird enclosures and the session on aboriginal desert survival. There is a Zoologist available to answer questions. We loved every minute of our day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A nice place to spend half a day and well thought out. Take your time, it has a lot to offer. Check out the timetable for various things on show :) Let you look into that and decide what suits you etc. A fair bit of walking is required and maps + signage is provided. Staff are very helpful and polite."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Almost every lecture or show in the park is a learning experience, and a few of them are especially worthwhile. The 'survival' show was especially informative, as was the wonderfully entertaining bird show. The staff was very attentive and friendly, which was good because our group had a LOT of questions! A must-see in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,There is a lot of walking through different landscapes with some detours to visit birds and nocturnal animals. When we were there no special activities were happening though we walked past several venues that advertised them. It probably depends on when you arrive. We were interested in the flora but there was very little labelling. Not terribly memorable
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Loved the spacious grounds and excellent exhibits. Great look at desert environments and although we had been in the area camping for 6 weeks, we learned new things and saw new (for us) birds and plants. Staff excellent. Hardly anyone there when we went, so had extra attention from staff. Must see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Nowhere is the admission price stated until you reach the cash desk at the entrance. $25 per person is way over the top. This is the same price as entry to the national park at Uluru.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was really interesting. A couple of the staff were a bit on the grumpy side but overall we had a really good time here. If you go don't miss the bird show.... it was amazing have Australia's native birds swooping in and around us as we sat there listening to a very interesting talk.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Okay, so you've come to see the Red Centre. Why? To discover the desert, nest-ce pas? The Desert Park is your best starting place and will allow you to see what's ahead with entirely different eyes. This is one of the best realised interpretive attractions we've ever visited. It covers all of the different biological regimes that are found in the deserts in this part of the world and allows one to discover the rich variety of life forms that live in these harsh environments. We were transported with the range of beautiful birds that we saw, and they all exist in close proximity to Alice Springs, i.e. no ring-ins! Give yourself plenty of time, it's well worth it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spent half a day here looking through all the displays. The free flying bird display was brilliant. We did not realise there were so many Australian animals we had not seen before. The nocturnal house was also very good.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited twice in the same day, early in the morning before it got too hot (recommended) and for the nocturnal tour. The day tour is on well laid out paths, unescorted, and can be done at your own pace. Beautifully presented and the information on signs is helpful and entirely adequate. Will take about 1 1/2 - 2 hours to take it all in. The evening tour was very special. Two guides and red filters on their powerful lights ensure the animals are not disturbed and will go on doing whatever (eating probably) despite the presence of visitors. Our group was very small - only six people, including the two guides. It gives an entirely different feel vs. the day visit. Many different animals were seen, mostly small marsupials and, most notably, the echidnas. Not shy, waddled right up to us, inspected the shoes of the ladies - decided they were not interesting and moved back into the scrub. If you are interested in the Outback and its animal life, this is a must do. And a really excellent gift shop to boot. Highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Got there at 7.30am..perfect time.. its cool it sure heats up during the day. not many people at this time of the day which is best. Was leaving about 2pm and floods of tours were coming. Bush Tucker...a talk given on local foods and traditions was great..you can even try some of the dessert tomatoes and figs. Birds of prey was one of the most interesting shows ive seen, very well presented the falcon changed direction so quickly, owls, turns etc. There is a movie theatre with a large cinema sized screen. it shows the landscape pictures etc..its very good. The screen slides down at the end and you have a spectacular natural dessert backdrop. $27 entry fee is well worth it. If you go in the morning you may be able to park in the shade. They have a café, coffee and some healthy options."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We loved this place - the exhibits were fantastic, the staff were warm and knowledgeable. It combined the best of what this unique country can offer. A must see for the whole family."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We didn't have a lot of time here which was a shame as I would have liked to see more of the shows and talks. The bush tucker lady was informative and the bird show amazing! The birds just show up on queue as the ranger talks about them and they fly right over your head in the outdoor auditorium! It's amazing - I know they are trained but it really is good and I really recommend it - the kids would love it!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The first thing to do is to check out the cinema, and the documentary, wait until the end when the the curtain comes down."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Absolutely brilliant. The gardens, the raptor show, the birds and aviaries, the nocturnal house, can't recommend this too highly. Just go!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Excellent day out . Only criticism is that one of the finches in the enclosures tried to swoop us like 4 times. Brilliant park , took about 1000000000000 photos for my geography class to look at . The reptile enclosure was excellent , makes Adelaide zoo's look poor in comparison. I think , however , that it would be more appreciated by people 15 years and up."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Insufficient labelling of plants in the park. Poor and inaccurate information given about the start time of events in the park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Spent 3 hours here with my 10 year old. Amazing place to take the time and observe the animals and birds. There was a lot of walking and we thought we would get lunch ...it seems the cafe has very limited food, and the person serving was not very helpful. So perhaps bring your own lunch. Was a bit dissapointed in the keeper talks - could have been so much more interesting than reciting a list of facts, but I am comparing this to the fantastically engaging interactions with staff at Healesville Sanctuary in Vic. Overall, a lovely way to put names to all the local wildlife, and flora."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park was an excellent mix between entertaining and educational and I enjoyed every minute of my visit. The actual park is set in a very natural environment (certainly not the concrete jungle you'd expect from a city zoo) and the back drop is beautiful - picture attached. Because of this relatively natural setting, I was actually able to see plenty of wildlife independent of the park. Upon entry, you are given an audio device which plays recordings of a true blue Aussie explaining the curiosities of Central Australia. As it is a desert-themed zoo, the emphasis is on arid environments and the life which inhabits it. Of course, your appreciation of this will vary depending on your actual interest on the natural world. The bird show was excellent and we were lucky enough to see wild wedge-tails gliding around. Fortunately or unfortunately, this alarmed the galahs (as they are natural prey) and caused them to be woefully disobedient, which was very amusing. The walk-in aviaries were equally amazing. There are many species which would be very hard to find in the wild and my favourite was a particularly noisy chiming wedgebill which had a beautiful song. The absolute highlight of the park is the Nocturnal House, which is a great opportunity to see all the cryptic animals that emerge at night. The only regret I have about this place is that I didn't give myself enough time and had to rush through the end. I'll certainly be back if I ever come to Alice again. Oh, and make sure to ask your accommodation providers about the shuttle service which runs there. A bus will pick you up and drop you off from your accommodation. I found it to be a hassle-free way to get there, and totally worth the small cost."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I spent 4 hours at the Desert Park. Highly recommended. I was on my own which gave me time to drift through and really take the time for quiet observation.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Chose to go to this park baed on the reviews we read and we weren't disappointed. Have 3 kids, 7, 9 and 10 and loved the bird show in particular with wild birds flying in and around the amphitheatre. Best show of that type we have seen with the presenter, Ilsa, doing an amazing job of giving facts, showing the birds and entertaining. Also loved the nocturnal house. Well worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is the second time we have been to Desert Park. First time was ten years ago before kids. We enjoyed it as adults then and our three kids loved it now. We also did the nocturnal tour. We would thoroughly recommend as a 'must do'. The kids and us alike loved it. The nocturnal tour was a highlight of our whole trip. Thank you
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I live here and visit regularly. Go early in the morning when everything is active. There are three walk through aviaries and most people do exactly that, walk through. Mistake! Sit down and watch, you will see far more the birds behave as if you are not there and it is wonderful. The information talks at different times are interesting and informative. If it gets hot, visit the nocturnal house."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Living in Alice we brought a years pass to Alice Springs Desert Park. Our 2yr old loves it. A lovely peaceful place to spend a couple of hours. I never tire of the bird show as they rotate the birds on display. The nocturnal house is excellent and the walk in bird aviaries are delightful. Best of all for mums there is a sand pit and a coffee shop to end the morning. Best to avoid it in the heat of the day, early mornings are my favorite time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,It's worth the short drive out of Alice to get here and it does give an overview of the flora and fauna of the desert regions of Australia and I'll certainly go again. Preferably time your visit around the displays which you can find out about on the website.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Don't miss this. Great way to learn about the different desert environments/ plants of Centralia. Nocturnal house fantastic! You'll see animals here that you'll never see on a camping trip. Don't miss the bird show at 10 am or 3 pm (they are different shows) with free flying trained birds. Also some very interesting guided tours and info about aboriginal culture. Souvenir shop nice, too. My favorite spot is one of the many walk-in aviaries but will need to visit the kangaroos next time, too... (yes, I'm a local=))"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a great place to see native birds and learn to identify them. The staff are friendly and helpful and the layout is very good.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you are in Alice Springs, go to the Desert Park. We had the privilige that we had the park almost for us alone - on word: Phantastic. Take your time to see it all. Great people, helpfull, great displays, well done. Got almost kissed by a dingo - what can you expect more?"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert park is an excellent day out. Initially the entrance price of $25 seemed a bit steep, but after 6 hours exploring the park, attending the varied presentations scheduled throughout the day, watching the beautiful birds in the many aviaries and visiting the animals and reptiles in the nocturnal house, we felt it was very good value. The free-flying bird show was particularly impressive, with one native bird after another swooping into and through the amphitheatre, and displaying themselves as the ranger provided interesting commentary about each. Close encounters of the dingo-kind was fun, and the ""Changing Heart"" movie engaging. The weather was rather hot and perhaps this is why visitor numbers were low - we only had to share the park with a handful of others, and we felt very privileged. The park is well organised, with clear sign-posting and many information boards, all set in keeping with the natural desert environment. I can highly recommend the desert park. Remember to take sunscreen and a hat."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We headed directly to the kangoroo park, which is very nice. You get really close to the kangoroos and you can be within the fence and have a great view on them."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent several hours wandering around the centre seeing what the Central Australia has with wildlife and birdlife, it is very well set up and the staff we informative on all aspects of the Park."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This really is a most excellent way to pass the afternoon. It tells you all about deserts, the different sorts of deserts that there are, why there is so much that actually goes on in terms of wildlife and plants in these areas that most of us think are completely dead, how nature has evolved to enable these plants and animals to survive and how the introduction of three European mammals; the domestic cat, the rabbit and the fox has had such a devastating effect on the indigenous plants and animals such that many of them face extinction. Wow! This isn't some boring indoors exhibition but three real life deserts replicated outdoors along with lots of aviaries where you can see birds that you would only ever see in a book actually in a natural habitat. Then there's the Nocturnal House. Most desert life happens at night obviously because it's simply too hot in the daytime and the Nocturnal House replicates this and it's just SOOO interesting. I really wished we had spent time here before we went out to the bush and I'm sure we would have appreciated the whole thing a lot more. If I have a criticism of it it's that it's in the wrong place. It should be in Ayers Rock where it would be inundated with visitors. As it was we only saw two other people in the whole attraction."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Started early, great idea in the heat. Beautifully designed into the landscape. Facilities are really good and if you're a bird lover..wow. Roos were a bit far away. Would've liked more interaction. Flying show was good. Program runs all day but the weather was too hot. As an intro to life in the Aussie bush, I think this has a lot of potential, but in hot weather, more of the program needs to be indoors."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Although visiting the desert park during the day on prior occasions, which is spectacular, This time we did the Nocturnal tour which has to be one of the best tour we have done. Although your guide has the main spotlight, all participants also have their own red light torch to spot their own local fauna. Walk around a private 10 acre property, fenced off area, just with the wild-life. A magical experience."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Then visit the Desert Park, Alice Springs. We traveled to Aus to see my daughter and before we went we had the usual misconceptions about being ""Down Under""... snakes, spiders, reptiles and please stay out of the water! Our experience was completely different. Tes, we did encounter an Australian Redback Spider but it didn't bite and they are not normally fatal in humans! But, more of the Desert Park. It is fairly compact and well laid out. My personal penchant is for birds and there are many and varied types of birds within the park. As has been reported by others, the ""birds of prey"" display is a MUST. It is so well done that you almost believe that the birds appear by magic ;-) Take a good camera and lens with a fast shutter speed. You will soon fill up a memory card. There are many other attractions within the park and all appear to have enough space to behave completely naturally. This is no ""zoo"" of caged animals. All in all, a very enjoyable experience and one that I can recommend."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great park with lots of native wildlife to see. we had a great presentation on indigenous bush food and customs. A real eye opener. The bird show is fabulous.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were a little disappointed as 80% of the animal enclosures are for birds. To be fair, the nocturnal exhibit was closed on the day we went and they offered a ~25% discount on admission. The only large animal displays we saw were the kangaroos and a lizard. We did not pay for the birds of prey show which some reviewers rave about. Overall, some of the birds were cool (there are a few large parrots), but we didn't see a lot else. At $18.50pp, it wasn't particularly worth it to us."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Time on my hands on one of many trips to Alice, decided to try this out. A great snapshot of many of the plants and animals of Central Oz. Surprised I haven't been there before, well worth the rather expensive entry fee but not worth a return visit. Try to get as many of the ranger talks as possible, and a great movie to finish."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fabulous, fabulous. Excellent interpretation by knowledgeable staff. Outstanding nocturnal exhibit. I would highly recommend a visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Spent a few hours (have visited twice) wandering through the park. The displays are lovely and some you can actually walk into and find yourself with birds peeking at you from the foliage. The gardens are great, easy place to visit, alone or with others, loads to see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,It was very hot that day but I foudn this place organized and all the staff competent. I appreciated the reptilarium.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was our second visit and if anything it was better than three years ago. On a very hot day, we started early walking through the different habitats and enjoying the extremely informative display panels, the aviaries, and a talk on Aboriginal food and customs. As it got above 40°, we retreated to the brilliant nocturnal house for a tour with one of the rangers, which lasted an hour and wasn't a minute too long. Apparently it's the biggest nocturnal house in the Southern hemisphere, and full of snakes, endangered marsupials, lizards etc. You can also go to a demonstration of birds of prey which we enjoyed three years ago. We had to leave at noon, after over four hours, but you could easily spend the whole day there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"we spend a morning in the park and enjoyed very much! alison told us so interesting things about the aboriginal culture, matt learned us so much about the reptiles and the bird show was impressive, too. walking around was fun, take enough time! we were happy there was cold water to refill our bottle, thank you so much! all in all: don't miss it!!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you stay in Alice Springs please take time to go this way. It is a great Park and you need a lot of time to see all. Very interested plants und animals. Many performenses are important. z.B. Eagle,.....and much more. An Audioguide in all languages are avaible."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Both day & night - the Park had so much to see & was wonderfully conceived with a variety of entertaining & informative 'venues'. Yet it did not lose its 'bush' atmosphere.ALL STAFF were terrific.I'm sorry I can't remember your names to thank you again. Even in January,with the extreme heat,there was plenty of shade & opportunities to have breaks away from the sun. So exciting to see bilbies!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Trails are well marked as well as well kept. My favourite is the Bird Show followed by the Nocturnal House. I regret not having enough time to visit the kangaroos. I also like the idea of introducing other presentations into the park setting.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was initially reluctan to attend ,so glad I did!! The cultural talk by Alison was exceptional, her knowedge and ability to relate the indigineous culture philosophies, tribal law, anglosaxon interaction, women's role was clear and relevant The bird show held my interest, have seen a number of bird shows at other venues and expected the same dreary routine...not so. The nocturnal venue was fascinating, bit like spot teh animal, critter..we had a young girl aged 8 who was showing where the critters were hiding etc..bless her. Matty, the tour guide was helpful and friendly."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Loved the little tours and talks by the park staff, very enjoyable. Best bit was the bird of prey show. Would definitely recommend going, even when its crazy hot!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Some animals you will be happy not to encounter in the wild (pythons) while others one would be glad to see. Here in the Desert Park we found a great overview - and many photo opportunities.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What an amazing park. I loved every minute of my time there. I photographed to my heart's content. There is something about desert vegetation that I find very appealing. The park is beautifully maintained. The initial presentation was most informative and the map was excellent. Loved seeing the kangaroos and birds, also the free flying bird show. The shop had a great selection of aboriginal art."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you have never experienced the desert of Australia, you have to go here, even though we reside and work in the Western Desert, visiting allowed us to experience the wildlife close-up."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Our visit to the Desert Park was at the end of our Yulara,Kata Juta, Kings Canyon, West McDonnell's experience. It drew together and provided much needed context to the diversity of ""The Desert"" environment. The daytime park was alive with delightful birdlife and the Nocturnal House provided cool relief from the heat and tantalising glimpses of rarely seen fauna."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Visited the first afternoon we arrived in Alice. Most impressed by location and friendly staff. Was very educational to see wildlife in natural surroundings
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I could not believe how boring this place was!! Nothing to see part from birds. Maybe I'm just very lucky to have seen such wonderful animals around the world but this was a complete waste of time and money, in my opinion!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Desert Park is worth the visit to enhance your knowledge of the desert and outback Australia. Join in with the guided tours if you can because they add an extra dimension and explain a lot more. Start early, I would suggest trying to get there as soon as it opens and take food if you plan to stay most of the day. Food is available there, but is a bit expensive. Drink plenty of water as it can get hot walking around, there are plenty of water stations set around the park, take sunscreen and a hat. We caught local bus which doesn't take you all the way to the park and the park is set off the highway, maybe a couple of kilometres. Still it was well worth the trip. Great for families or single travellers, seems a bit pricey at first but plan to spend a good part of the day there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Is a place up with any other world wide similar place. A large range of local animals, plants, wildlife and continually being upgraded. Is about 6 to 8 k out of town so do not try to walk out if it is warm weather despite some locals saying it is easy. It is easy but not for people who are not used to the heat we can experience. The area is all walking but golf carts and chairs are available if required. Through the middle of the day animals tend to have brains and are sleeping or out of sight so early morning or late afternoon for a great walk around the place."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Spent ten years in Alice Springs in the 70s & 80s. What a glorious ""find"" on return over 2 decades later. Wonderful, helpful, local Arrernte Indigenous staff. Beautiful balance between a true bush walk and stuff you would never see or learn in twenty years of bush walks! Loved it. Visit in the cooler early morning or evening if possible. Allow yourself at least a couple of hours to get the full experience. With the beautiful MacDonnell Range gaps and gorges, and Uluru, this is truly one of Central Australia's very finest places for any visitor, local or international."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The presenters were especially excellent --- discussing aboriginal lives and survival in the desert region and a guide who somehow was able to have several different birds fly in and around and swoop down to the audience. The educational aspects of the park were very well done. It was a good experience
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We arrived and paid an extra $20 for the Eagle Encounter thinking that we'd just get to see an eagle show. Low and behold we had our photo taken standing next to a wedge-tailed eagle. The ranger takes the photos with your own camera so you are not buying photos they have taken. Amazing experience! We took audio guides and gave ourselves a self-guided tour. The cutural presentation by a young lady with Aboriginal heritage was excellent. LIke everywhere else in this area they are plenty of flies so take a fly net if you have one.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As advised we arrived soon after the 7.30am opening when it was cooler and the wildlife more active. The park is laid out in areas depicting the various desert habitats. There are many large aviaries, including walk - in, and a large nocturnal house. The free flying bird display was outstanding, With so many captive birds the wild birds were attracted into the gardens as well, so bird watchers and photographers should allow plenty of time for their visit!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,its worth visiting. Everything is explained very well and we enjoid the Birds Show. A desert Park in the Desert where you have to pay entrance fee was one of the highlights of our journey
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I went here thinking I would only spend a couple of hours - 9 hours later I still wasn't done! On entry you get an audio guide which is brilliant for navigating your way around and actually learning about your surroundings. Their programme of activities is also jampacked so throughout the self-guided walk there was also plenty more to do, such as the bird of prey show where the birds go right through the crowd and the aboriginal talks which is really hands-on (we spent about 2 hours talking with the presenter afterwards). You could hire a bike to get here but you'll be doing plenty of walking throughout the day so I would reccomend booking with one of the various shuttle buses."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,You need to leave a whole day to appreciate this. There are talks by aboriginals and displays and a wonderful bird show. The rangers are very friendly and helpful. Just a beautiful day in a unique place.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Not wanting to sit around the airport for four hours between flights, we found a cheap car rental (AVIS) and drove out to the Desert Park. What a great way to while away the hours! It was a great introduction to the Australian desert, so that when we arrived in Uluru, we felt like we had a better understanding of the habitat. The park was laid out very nicely. The audio guide tour was so informative. Really appreciated all of the shade stops as we visited on a very hot day. And if you like birds, you'll be in seventh heaven!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent about 5 hours here, and felt there was still more to see and learn. The setting at the foot of the Macdonnell Range is stunning and there is no feeling that the various habitats you wander through are in any way artificially created. Particularly impressed by the Indigenous culture presentation, the bird show (fantastic!), the nocturnal house (the thorny devil licking up ants was a highlight, but some of the creatures were either absent or not visible) and the many aviaries. Very surprised at the numbers of birds both inside the walk-through enclosures and flying wild in the the park. Staff were knowledgeable, helpful and friendly, and the audio guide very informative. Suggest wearing closed shoes, as not all paths are sealed. Only (very slight) criticism is of the wedge tail encounter, which turned out to be a rather pricey photo opportunity, and although you do get stand close to the bird, the pics taken for us were disappointing. Overall - highly recommended, a visit certainly makes you look for and see more in the desert."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great way for kids to find out about life in the desert. The park is set out in areas to reflect different ecosystems. Highlights were the walk through aviary and the nocturnal house. We also saw the bird show and a demonstration of aboriginal life in the desert with lots of artifacts. Food and drink at the cafe was very expensive.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a fairly small enterprise for a 'desert park', and we found the best thing was the nocturnal house where we got a good view of animals, snakes, birds and reptiles that we would not normally have seen. The raptor demonstration is OK, but we found better ones elsewhere in Australia - for example at Healesville outside Melbourne. It's not worth the extra money to have your piccie taken with an eagle: the bird is one that was injured when young, and the guy who took the shots with our camera missed including us in the picture! There's not a lot of competition around Alice Springs, which may be why this gets such high ratings."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Nocturnal animals are doubtless best seen at night. In 42 degree heat they were hardly seen at all. Despite very enthusiastic staff doing their best with informative sessions there are better things to do in Alice Springs.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It was a totally new experience with plants and animals of that region. Although it was hot, we were able to have a close look at a wedge tailed eagle, huntsman spider on the EXIT light, aborginal artists working on their beautiful works."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Desert Park is a wonderful place to spend a leisurely few hours to just immerse yourself in the timeless feel of central Australia. You can get in touch with your own `dreamtime' wandering the easy trails through wild flowers or sandy gullies. Or capture that sought after shot of the extensive birdlife on display in the well organised bird enclosures. The Nocturnal exhibit is worth a visit to cool down and learn about the adverse effects man is having on this landscape and what we can do to fit in. Well worth the effort! Enjoy!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great venue to appreciate Central Australia's Outback. Excellent information and helpful staff. The bird show is a must. We arrived very early and quickly made our way towards the kangaroos. We were the first one there. As the roo's were feeding and didn't seem to mind us at all, we were able to get close to them. The whole place is a peaceful sanctuary where one simply slows down to appreciate the fauna and flora of the desert. Highly recommendable."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great introduction to Central Australia, with good information and helpful staff. The bird show is not to be missed and we also enjoyed making an extra contribution to meet the Wedge Tailed Eagle who will live out his days there as he will not be able to fly properly."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The desrt park was beautiful in a rugged sort of way and the sunset seen over this mars-like landscape was truly exceptional. Hope I can visit again some day in the future.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The bird show (free flight) is well worth scheduling into your visit. If it looks like you are wandering around a desert...you are so you might prepare children for that rather than a zoo as such. The Nocturnal exhibit was very good and quite extensive...and a good respite from the heat. The park has done well to offer a lot of shady stops along the way as well as frequent water stops...but it is still very open so I would suggest earlier or later in the day for comfort.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Make sure you go to see the bird show, wonderful! Very nice day! I was told to go in the morning because of the hot weather, very good advice!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We enjoyed the walk and the information that was available. Also the cold water was wonderful to replenish our water bottles. A highlight was the nocturnal house being able to see bilbys and other amazing creatures. The downside to our visit was the approachability of the staff. The woman who took our money didn't even say hello. The guide talked to us about my grand daughter's necklace but didn't give us the map and when I had to go back to get the map she argued with me. At the end we decided on a lunch there but the cafe lady didn't say hello either so we left.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Park is very well done. Yuo can take the park at your own place, and spend time in areas that interest you. We were able to see kangaroos and birds up close and observe their behavior for as long as we wanted to. A TIP though - in warm weather the flies are VERY BAD, invest in the fly net hoods (available at stores in town) before you go - you will be glad you did!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You could spend all day walking around this wonderful place. Wildflowers were spectacular in September '13. Bird show was a must, loved walking in to the huge bird enclosures and have the birds flying around us. Timing of shows could be better, with having to walk longish distances between. Nocturnal house great. Eagle encounter worth it for groups, only $20 to get up close and personal with an eagle. Was disappointed with cinema presentation, previously when I had seen it the curtain parted at the end to reveal the MacDonnells in all their glory, didn't happen this time when I wanted to share the experience."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The park is great and the movie at the end is spectacular. A great place to spend a couple of hours. The ranger talks very informative.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a the best attraction close to Alice Springs. The range of plants, birds and nocturnal desert species is impressive - well worth going."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"At first, I was put off by the price of admission. I soon realized the value was absolutely there. Loved all the birds, flowers, and geology. The self-guided tour with the recorded information made for a wonder experience. If I return to Alice Springs many more times, I will always want to visit this park. I absolutely loved it. Everyone needs to visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"we stumbled upon this more by accident, but it was a fantastic experience. Very informative with an audio included in the price, easy to use as you meandered at your own pace around the park. Lots of aviaries all well designed - and the birds must have approved with all the nesting going on. The nocturnal house was one of the best I've seen. Lots of spots to sit in the shade and enjoy some down time or a snack. Really wished we'd been able to spend more time, would certainly go again"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The bird show is a definate must do. Wandering around the park and discovering so much more of what this country is all about really opened my eyes.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic. The amount of knowledge that Doug our tour guide possessed was wonderful, this was another highlight of our trip to Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,To be honest thought this place might be a bit ho hum but it proved me wrong. The aboriginal artist centre had some really good art to look at and purchase. The bird show was excellent and being able to go through the nocturnal house and see animals that you would never get a chance to spot is great. Well worth the visit.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The ranger talks make this a must see and do. Great cultural background. The cinema presentation has a fantastic conclusion that I will not give away. Desert Park is a must do when visiting Alice.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was a great few hours spent. Hand held speakers tell you about all the exhibits as you get to them. We could have spent longer here if we had the time. You see all types of deserts and as we drove through central Australia we saw all the things we had seen here.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A very professionally setup and operation. Well maintained with large cafe, shop and expansive nocturnal animal exhibit. Lots of walking tracks to cover, with many informative signs and animal exhibits on the way. The audio tape is a must and take the time to listen to some of the addition information talks you can listen to. I attended a couple of the scheduled talks, and was particularly impressed with the woman who shared her knowledge of the indigenous foods and traditions of her people. Her obvious pride in her heritage had everyone listening attentively. Not accessible by public transport but easy enough to book a shuttle for motel pickup. I planned on staying for only a couple of hours but decided to take my time and stay longer."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Excellent displays. The Ranger talks are informative and interesting. Allow at least half a day - more to fully enjoy all on offer.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,It really is brilliant! It's hard to know where to start when describing it - maybe it's best to say it represents most of the desert wildlife in one spot. So very well done. Cafe and toilets for when you need a break. Great for families.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,If you live in the outback as I do you may think you know all about it. You dont. Visit the park it is very well done. If you are a lazy bird watcher this is the place to be. The bird cages are very large which allows the birds to be viewed in fairly natural settings and terific photos can be taken. Ignore the leg bands!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Entertaining and informative insight into desert life & cycles, indigenous culture, and great walk through bird viewing. Also enjoyed nocturnal exhibition with many reptiles and rare bilbies and other mammals. The indigenous culture talk was exceptionally interesting."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A visit to this park today was very possibly the highlight of our stay in Alice Springs. The park is a combination of a botanic garden, a nature park and an information / educational institution, with a great cafe thrown in for good measure. Work is still being done on this wonderful attraction but If you're heading to Alice Springs, make sure it's on your list of 'must sees'. My husband and I are 'seniors' but I am confident that our children and their children would love it as much as we did. Chris Dent"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I loved visiting Alice Springs! I had wanted to see the place ever since reading the book ""A Town Like Alice."" I was able to visit several places and learn a lot of the history of the place. Amazing!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A few years ago we went to the Alice Springs Desert Park for the first time after friends recommended it to us. This year we thought we'd go back for another look and found a few changes. We purchased our day pass and inquired about the Eagle Encounter we had seen advertised. At $20 for the two of us we considered it was reasonably priced so purchased a pass. The next 2 hours was spent wandering around the park. The birds and wildflowers were amazing. At 10am we lined up for the free flying bird show where Mel, the handler, showed us owls, falcons, galahs,and kites,explaining their different habits. It was an action packed 20 minutes and well worth it. After the show we wandered round some more until 11:30am when it was time for the Eagle Encounter. This is a small group session. We were escorted to the eagle by a very interesting gentleman who also took some really great photos of the two of us standing next to the wedge tail eagle. Once again it was Mel who told us all about this beautiful bird. Believe me, this session is well worth the money if you want to get up close to a wedge tail. We then spent the rest of our time wandering around this vast park and eventually spent five and a half hours there. It's also a great place for photos. The only disappointment for the day was the cafe. It did have a sign up apologizing for the limited service but at least we did get something to eat. Altogether it was a spectacular day and we left there feeling exhausted but very happy with our day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A local recommended we visit this park to get a taste of the nature and history of Alice Springs. The park is divided by environments you find in this desert region and you are provided with an audio device to describe different areas, particularly from an indigenous perspective as you wander through at your own pace. There are guided walks run regularly as well. There are look in and walk through aviaries, a nocturnal house and to top the day off a free 'birds in flight' show. There is also a video to watch which we had been told was a must see but we unfortunately missed. The people working here were all very helpful, knowledgable and friendly. The cost of $25 per person was well worth the cost of entry."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic introduction to Aboriginal culture, desert animals , birds & flowers. The 9am talk on how to survive in the desert was fantastic. The bird show was great & the nocturnal talk really informative. Good value at $68 for a family & includes audio guide."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Love this place. The scenery is magnificent and the displays are fantastic. If you are lucky enough (I am) to be able to visit on a regular basis it is a wonderful place just to wander. Looking forward to the wildflower walk....
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is great for all ages...the 'free bird flying' event is fantastic and very informative as well. The colors from the flowers with the red earth were so pretty. birds singing...! Weather perfect too....
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park has many wonderful different features from experiencing feeding of wild birds of prey to observing nocturnal small animals in their natural habitat in the special enclosure. The park is well signposted and documented and they have mororized 'gophurs' available for hire for those who are unable to walk easily, motorised carts for the disabled and wheelchairs available. The paths are well laid out and easy to walk with many of the unique Australian animals such as wallabies, kangaroos and emus in enclosures and very visible. The wildflowers are a treat to see as are the native parrots, cockatoos and other birds like lovely little zebra finches. Rangers who are extremely knowledgable about the flora, fauna and their habitat, ecology etc are available and a film show which is amazing is shown in the theatre and is not to be missed. A cafeteria is on site for food and drink purchase. The best time to visit is probably during the spring, winter and autumn as it gets very hot in Alice Springs and in mid summer temperatures can reach 40 deg plus celcius. Commonly in summer the temperatures will reach between 30 and 36 deg celcius so if you visit during the summer months (Dec through Feb) remember to carry and drink lots of water (you will dehydrate very quickly in these temperatures) wear a hat and sunglasses and don't forget to slap on the sunscreen. The colours of the ranges that rise alongside the park are supurb in early morning and evening and the blue of the sky has to be seen to be believed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is one of the top attractions in Alice Springs. From the Audio tour by Narrowcasters to the diverse desert plants, trees and micro environments. The night house where all the endangered animals are is brilliant. They are doing such a great job safeguarding the future of these small mammals. But the most wonderful thing is the display of free flight by the raptors and the other birds. The trainers have done a fantastic job and the birds seem to just love to perform."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The park offers a view of the diverse flora and fauna available in the area. It is still being added to however the bird show and the reptile house are not to be missed
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a gorgeous park that takes visitors through the varied desert environments along with the plants and animals that inhabit them. There are presentations everyday, including a free flight bird show and talks on how the Aboriginal peoples survived the often harsh conditions of the bush. There are several enclosures where one can get up close to various birds and also a pen with some kangaroos. The nocturnal house is excellent with a variety of birds, mammals, lizards and insects - we spent quite a lot of time in there! A must visit - and if you have a Territorian Pass entry is free."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you only have a short stay in the Alice, this place is a MUST. Here you can see the variety of Central Australia environments and habitats including wildflowers and birds & animals of the arid zone. You can easily spend a full day exploring and if possible work your day around the different shows that are held during the day. There are bbqs and picnic tables situated just off the carpark which can also be used if you have the time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This morning we went to the Alice Springs Desert Park, a place you could easily spend several hours wondering around, although you should really check the park to find out what time the various activities are on otherwise you might miss some of the best. Be sure to have you camera charged and ready to go and enjoyed the free flight birds and the nocturnal, you can also see native flowers and kangaroos. Later enjoy a 30 film on the formation of the Northern Territory."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Many only pass through Alice on the way to see Uluru which is a shame. Alice does have a few issues which are being addressed and I think it is well worth staying awhile to get to know the place and the people who live there. A short drive out of town to the Desert Park will give you a good insight to both. Take the free self guide audio gadget and set off on a walk around the park. Check out the times and venues for the guided tours and talks. You will meet Australias' biggest bird of prey up close and learn why some of the locals never speak to their Mother in Law.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We enjoyed visiting the park while we were in Alice Springs, in June - July 2010. Do a self guided tour, using the CD player which is available for a small deposit. Name sure you have your camera charged up to capture the wildlife, there a few big Red Kangaroos in the park, as well as stunning flowers and of. Course The Wild Bird show. Man can those birds spot a meal a mile off, and swoop down SO fast to take it out of the keepers hand!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Alice Springs Desert Park has a fine collection of native birds and a respectable display of reptiles and smaller mammals in the Nocturnal House. The grounds are very well done and their are quite a few information shows available, as well as providing free audio guides. The park, minus shows, can probably be completed in about 2 hours, which is fair seeing the price of admission is about the same as a movie ticket in Alice Springs. We were very much looking forward to the wildlife show, but found that we only got to enjoy a small portion of it, as a scheduled tour got a pre show were asked to remain for a further show after we were left. Several local raptors and other birds were presented, but I had higher expectations based on word-of-mouth. Why only average? This place will delight bird fans, but the displays are relatively repetitive. I enjoyed the grounds but they are nothing you will not see if you travel a bit further down the road and hit any location in the Western MacDonnel Ranges. Some of the shows would be more attractive to tourists than to locals."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Pasrk is close to town, but still gives that outback experience. The Bird show was amazing!! The cleanliness and care that is taken of the place is very evident. The Nocturnal House was well laid out and managed. We enjoyed our few hours there, but would like to have seen more Aboriginal people on the staff."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The site is quite large but very laid out with clearly marked walks, you are provided with a clear map of the attraction on arrival which is helpful in planning a route to include all that you wish to view. There are several aviaries here you can walk in and view birds without looking at through a mesh or suchlike. Well worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,this is well worth the time and the admission to go and see this attraction as there is so much to see and enjoy. the bird of prey show is fantastic
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We were recommended to take this 4 hour tour and was glad that we did. The Park has the country's birds and flora and of course we saw the kangeroos. Very informative and worth going for a couple to hours. Met another Singaporean family and that was nice. Have seen better bird show elsewhere but it is still quite an attraction.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This attraction is a 45 minute easy cycle ride from town with other attractions on the way. a visit to the desert park makes a good trip with plenty of interest in the park itself. Friends also visited on my recommendation and enjoyed the visit. Hired my bike from YmCA in town
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The shows are thoroughly enjoyable and I'd recommend going to all of them. The staff are clearly passionate about their work and one even took the time to give some guests a personal tour of the park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The lack of animals was a little disappointing however the bird show was great and something I have never seen before
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you want to know about the Australian desert, go to this park. We had a self guided tour using the hand held audio commentary, which was so informative and very easy listening. We have since travelled through the desert and this park visit gave us such an appreciation of what to look for and appreciate. It's worth spending hours there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Just planned on going for one of the talks and spending 2 hours or so ....... after 5 hours including the spectacular bird show though we were inspired to see more of the countryside with new insights ......
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,having just arrived in Alice Springs from very basic accommodation found Alic Springs Desert Park to be a breath of fresh air - beautiful hot showers TV's that worked and well kept grounds.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It was recommended to us by friends to go here when we were in Alice Springs earlier this month and we are so pleased we took their advice. Located only a short distance from the centre of town with plenty of parking. Included in the entry fee you are provided with an audio device that explains the various sections of the park as you make your way around it. We spent 3 hours there, the highlights for us being the bird show and the reptile exhibit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I love to visit nature parks and this is one of the best. You can see examples of different types of desert country, plants that grow in deserts and, most importantly, the birds and other critters that inhabit Central Australia. I visit the Desert Park at least twice every time I go to Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I spent 4 hours walking through the different desert plant communities, looking at birds and nocturnal house, listening to the fantastic audio commentary and viewing the bird show. What an amazing place!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is an amazing park with so many beautiful birds and animals. I especially enjoyed seeing the thorny devil and the different variety of plants that live within this desert environment. The Park is easy to walk around and I enjoyed the interactive displays.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We came to Alice Springs expecting a hot remote barren place. From the time we landed we realized that was not the case but the real clincher was to visit this desert park. We went thinking a couple of hours would be good. It was nearly five hours later that we left. It certainly is world class. It is set on a site that is over 1300 acres. It is easy walking and well signed.There is an audio tour available and well worth purchasing. There are many viewing areas for birds. In fact that was the biggest surprise for us the diversity of the bird population. Also many interesting plants to see and learn about. There is a fantastic Aboriginal seminar on the way of life of the Aboriginal people. There is an outdoor bird show with a number of birds participating. A well stocked gift shop with native art for sale and a place to get food and drink.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"So much to see and do: Listen to guides talk about aboriginal life and discuss the parks habitat. Take in the flight show. See numerous birds out in the natural environment. Spend time in the nocturnal house - excellent viewings of birds, reptiles and mammals. Check out the aviaries with many birds all around you. There are also caged birds to see. Don't leave out going to the kangaroo enclosure for an up close view. Of course there are many great photo opportunities in the park. The 4 hours my wife and I spent here were not enough to fully enjoy the park but unfortunately we had to leave to catch our next flight."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The staff that you get to interact with here are so professional and knowledgable, you walk away with an appreciation of every thing flora and fuana that the desert has to offer. Spend the extra few cents and get the audio tour. You won't regret it. Make sure you catch the eagle flight displays."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Went to the Desert Park on my way into town from King's Canyon and spent a few hours there. Definitely a large and varied facility with the full spectrum of Australian outback wildlife. Highlights were the nocturnal animal house, being able to walk around inside the kangaroo exhibit and (especially) the phenomenal bird show. It is, as most zoos, catered mostly towards kids, but there is still enough to see as an adult. Only downside for me was that in a LOT of exhibits the animals were not visible (excluding the birds). This is a fairly natural consequence of going to a desert in the middle of the day when it is 38C+, but still disappoint. Also, as with everything in the Outback, it is hella expensive to get in (~$25). Otherwise well worth your time if you've come out to Alice Springs, especially if you are with children."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I only had an afternoon and I was able to get to Desert Park; I saw the bird show which was great. I learned so much about the environment about the 3 different types of desert. I was afraid of going into the open pen with the kangaroos though !!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Went to visit my son who lives in Alice Springs. He wanted to give us something to do so we went to the Desert Park night walk. We absolutely loved it. Saw animals out at night in their natural habitat. Was fun walking around in the dark with little red lights only. Also I have never seen the stars so bright. Our guide pointed out many star groups and even the milky way. I have always lived in cities so it is too bright to be able to see the stars so well. Great time by myself and son.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Loved the birds of prey display and the nocturnal house. The thorny devils are so cute. Only downside was the lack of facilities for food. We would have stayed for lunch but there was nowhere really to go.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"had a great afternoon wandering the desert park and seeing the local fauna etc. Cafe, however, could do with a makeover. Little selection of food."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Found the desert park very informative, well laid out and quite diverse. Well worth a visit and the bird show which is held at 10 am and I think 2:30 pm is not to be missed. Entry fee is a bit up there at $25 per adult but there are concessions available and it really is worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Our visit to the desert park was a dissapointment. We visited 10 years ago and it was really great. This time it seemed to be lacking the ""wow"" factor. The staff seemed tired and uninterested. The displays seemed tired and in need of a freshen up. The only high point was the bird show, but even this was only a shadow of the show we saw last visit. Dissapointing"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had a spare day in Alice and our wonderful host from 'Pathdorf' suggested that we would like this. We arrived at 10.30 and left as they closed. We learnt a lot about the plants, animals and birds that manage to survive the hostile desert environment. The birds were stunning and the information boards brilliant...so good that we had to buy the book with them in! We went to a talk on Aborigine culture which my husband is telling everybody about a month later. Our only moan was that the cafe closed about 2.30, when we had been at the talk, so when it finished we went to have some lunch and there was only the machines, crisps (chips) etc..in the UK we would expect to get tea almost until closing time at this type of attraction."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs itself is a seriously unattractive town. Fortunately it is surrounded by some stunning scenery which makes the trip well worth while. The Alice Springs Desert Park is a stunner. Beautifully laid out into the different desert zones, its easy to navigate and well worth the admissions fee."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Destert Park had `a comprehensive range of reptiles, animals, flora and displays relted to the diverse local cenvironment. The bird show in the amphitheatre is not to be missed"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is a great asset for Alice Springs. We spent the best part of a day there.Well set out, the free audio guide was very informative as we walked through the different terrain. Liked the aviaries, with seats to sit and watch the bird life. and the walk-in ones with the birds flying overhead were great The nocturnal house was a excellent - especially the Bilbys. The cinema showed a film on how the area evolved and was well made, and the gift shop had a nice range of quality products. Well worth spending time at this park"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We didn't hear much about the park, but decided to venture out there and were so surprised! The bird show was amazing, plus the woodland wander with a guide was so interesting. The nocturnal enclosure was fantastic, as good as any zoo we have been to. Fresh cold drinking water throughout too. Unfortunately we didnt allow enough time, you could easily spend a full day there and take your picnic lunch."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Desert Park is a great opportunity to learn about the wildlife and environment that can be found in the Australian Outback. The Kangaroos were a big hit with the kids, as was the nocturnal animal exhibit. The cafe is not always open, but there are vending machines available for limited snacks if necessary. Recommend bringing a lunch or snacks, and definitely bring fluids to stay hydrated. Plan for at least 2-3 hours, but more time to truly enjoy the experience, as there are plenty of exhibits and things to explore to gain a true appreciation of the Outback!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"In the middle of the desert is this park withy unusual animals you only find living in the desert.Loved the colours of the rocks and sands.It is not your normal park as it is all very open and flat so easy to wander.The thorny devil was a funny creature,We loved our morning in this place."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spend a few hours in A.S. Desert Park, starting with the most interesting talk by a local Aboriginal guide. Then on to a bird show with lots of Eagles flying over our heads. The indoor nocturnal exhibit is beautifully done, we were rewarded with the sight of two thorny devils. The park is very well maintained and reflects the desert so well. The staff is all very helpful and friendly. Don't miss it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is an NT Government run tourist attraction which is first class. Entry fees are very reasonable. The rangers/guides are very knowlegable. You need to spend a full day there and make sure you get there early in the morning. The bird shows are excellent but there is a multitude of special educational exhibits etc each day.The onsite cafe/restaurant is to be recommended.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I've been to Desert Park in Alice Springs a couple of times now, once to visit and once when we organised a function there. It's an amazing place, finding out about flora and fauna where you only expect hot desert environment. I would recommend holding a function there anytime with great catering, management and flexible enough to accommodate your every needs. Even if visiting Alice Springs I strongly recomment going there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was one of the side tours offered to the guests on the Ghan Tribute to the Anzacs. It was so good but we could have spent hours enjoying ll there was to see.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We got the most out of the nocturnal viewing (outside at night) and the two great shows we went to (Aboriginal talk and bird show). In the indoor nocturnal exhibit it was difficult to catch sight of all the animals and we missed seeing the golden bandicoot and bilby. A highlight was the thorny devil. The bird show was amazing to see up close galahs, southern boobook, bush stone curlew, brown falcon, whistling kite and black kite. Spinifex pigeons also flew past."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,this is a brilliant place to visit. lovely walks well laid out and very interesting staff that gives talks etc. I found the dingos very interesting.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We visited the Alice Springs Desert Park with mixed feelings given that we had visited other sites in the Ali in the proceeding few days. This turned out to be a fantastic experience and a wonderful attraction to visit. The presentation at the amphitheater was the highlight with a number of different birds flying in to visit the ranger. His knowledge and thorough presentation on each specie was great. We then visited other areas of the park and were exposed to the different types of desert terrain all close to each other. The attraction is a modern excellently presented venue and the rangers and staff very helpful. I recommend visiting this attraction to all who visit the Alice.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The highlight is definitely the 10am bird show, featuring kites, falcons and owls among others. There are also some lovely aviaries and a fantastic nocturnal house which houses a number of snakes, thorny devils and very cute marsupials such as the bilby, bettong and quoll. The layout of the park is well thought-out and is easily walkable. My friend and I enjoyed the informative audio guide and generally thought the experience was very good. It's a pity the cafe closed at 11.15am and that we weren't able to access the aquarium display due to construction work, but otherwise felt this was a very pleasant way to spend 4 hours."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A place that has something for everyone! For every age as well. The walks are beautiful, it's very well done, the recreation of habitats it's very accurate and ""lush"" (as lush as a desert ecosystem can be) but because of that it attracts all kinds of bird visitors, and if you go later in the day when free bird visitors are not so keen of being seen, there are plenty of exhibits and so if you are birdwatcher, plant lover or outdoor lover this is your place. It also has beautiful views, with the ranges in the back, and you forget that you are not really in the outdoors, but I'm a park. The implementation of the walks is very good, it has shade stations to rest in every track, with drinking water, guided tours, or if you prefer to go by your own, a recording for interpretation of the path. The guides are well informed and nice, and they do amazing activities: from aboriginal culture related, to animal related. NOT TO MISS: the bird show!! Really amazing. When you leave the park you really leave with a better understanding of desert ecosystems, geology of Australia's deserts and Aboriginal significance of the land, besides having a good relaxing time in a gorgeous place. They do a great work. This is the tipe of places that we need to create consciousness about the environment and native cultures. Congrats to the staff"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent a great afternoon at the Desert Park, getting there and back in local taxis. We had been recommended to focus on the nocturnal house, as we'd be unlikely to see those animals in the wild, and it was great, as were the aviaries, the kangaroos and the flying display. Although there were quite a lot of people at the flying display, the park was so spacious and well laid-out that we saw very few other visitors the rest of the time. It was a great introduction to Australian desert wildlife."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A 'must do' if you are in Alice Springs. The presentation on bush tucker, hunting, and family life by a local person was really good. But the highlight was the noctural animal display. Large building with bilbys and all sorts of other species. A wonderful place to spend a half day, or even a full day."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A well thought out and laid out presentation of the desert flora and fauna. Presenters were knowledgeable and friendly
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is one of those little gems out in the world. A really interesting wildlife park focused on the local fauna. Kids will really enjoy the openess of it as you stroll around. The bird show is a real treat so make aure you allow time for that. Can be really hot in summer due to lack of larger shade trees (probably true to the environment) and lack of any breezes.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Really nice bird show at 10. Nice park to take a walk and see the different sides of the outback. Worth the time and money.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,See reviews for Uluru and Kata Tjuta for more information from visitors about Alice Springs Desert Park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent yhe day here, all the staff extemely knowledgeable and friendly. So much to see and do, birds amazing. The park makes you feel like you are in the desert."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Our best stop in Alice Springs. The rangers do an excellent job of describing the local plants and animals, and the talk about the aboriginal culture was one of the best of our entire tour of Australia. I think this is definitely the number one place to visit in Alice Springs. My wife chose, instead, to go to a casino and watch the Super Bowl on TV. (It was Monday morning here.) I think I made the right choice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very well set up park. Just enough to see and some interesting talks, especially the birds show which was excellent. A great way to spend a morning"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park is very thoughtfully laid out with great attention to the different types of ecosystems prevalent in the Alice Springs to Uluru areas, and there are many talks and informational sessions each day led by rangers or other experts, in addition to the audio guides (free of charge and in a wide variety of languages) throughout the park. Plan at least 3 hours, and go in the morning- it's not so hot, and there are more sessions to attend. Highlights- the free 'birds on the wing' presentation at 10;30 and 3:30, and the nocturnal animal house, where you can see all kinds of native Australian animals which only come out at night going about their business. You'll get an excellent sense of the native plants, birds, mammals and ecological systems you'll be going through on whatever excursion you take to Uluru or other local sites."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Excellent animal displays and guided activities in a beautiful natural setting. A half day at least is a must and don't miss the bird of prey show. We were thrilled to learn the reason they don't have Wedge Tailed Eagles in their bird show anymore is there is a wild pair that can be seen circling the cliffs above the park - I love places like this that really care about nature. The staff and guides were excellent and very knowledgable and passionate - makes for such a great experience. The nocturnal exhibit is a great escape from the heat and also had cool reptiles like the Thorny Devil - which we didnt get to see in the wild
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A visit to the Park is a must. The staff are so caring of the animals and birds in their care. They are knowledgable and happy to share that knowledge. The birds of pray display is another must
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The colours of the desert all around make it such a natural setting. Such weird animals and a very good bird show. Also learned a lot about aborigines.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I thought the fact that you can just wander around this place and be surrounded by animals was just amazing. Its the closest I have ever been to kangaroos.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a must see if visiting the Red Centre.You will experience many of the wonders of Central Australia in the one place and gain an insight into Aboriginal life you would never get elsewhere.So much to see;bird life,desert fauna and flora,an amazing film experience of the past in air conditioned comfort and guides eager to share their knowledge with you.There are wheelchair amenities and a well stocked gift shop.Take plenty of water as the heat can be intense and good walking shoes as you will want to spend many hours strolling through the diverse natural exhibits and habitats."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It costs about $25 to enter, but you can spend half a day here doing varied and Interesting things. The bird demo is super, the reptile exhibit is also good, and the talk about the Aboriginal culture is amazing. Not everyone will appreciate this place, but we loved it."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert walk with so many birds and wildflowers, etc. I was specailly treated to a viewing of a video about the beginning of time to the present time. Quite fascinating!! The staff looked after me so well, as I was the only one there at the time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Really good day out - I would have given this an excellent but went on a sunday and none of the tours etc were on! Will definitely go back to do the tours but in cooler weather
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I actually find this quiet boring. How many birds and kangaroos can u look at? The bird show is ok but still kinda boring, is abit long, and coz its so hot u gotta walk for ages outside to see the next bird! I'd rather the reptile centre in alice"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,There is a huge amount to see and learn about here. Three different kinds of desert environment have been created right next to the MacDonnell ranges and you learn something at every step. We were introduced to several native bird species by some of the park rangers in a very original way and our talk on the Aboriginal way of life taught me more than I have read in books over a decade of interest in the subject. We happened upon one of the rangers passing through the nocturnal room and had a personal guide who went out of his way to help us understand what we were looking at. Brilliant. Bravo to the Desert Park!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Nestling between the mountain ranges around Alice Springs, this desert park is well worth a few hours' visit. The scenery itself is worth the trip, but the ranger talks are very interesting indeed and the birds of prey display with a very informative ranger was wonderful. There are dozens of beautiful birds in large aviaries which you can get very close to; red kangaroos (mostly lying around); reptiles of all kinds."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a must visit location. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Staff very friendly and informative.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Excellent display of grasslands, wetlands etc. fantastic nocturnal house with great tour by rangers, bird display and talk - really well done, fantastic interactive displays and videos which give visitors a well rounded review of this region."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Really worth the trip. Picked up in a bus and returned some hours later. Bird show a must and also talk on Aboriginal society. Park itself contains some amazing birds and animals, an opportunity to get up close with a kangaroo. Restaurant fine and gift shop good. Staff very helpful, they got the projector going so that we could see a film on the Desert, even though we were the only people there. Don't miss!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The exhibits and displays were very professional as were the live shows with the birds. You could easily spend several hours here. It is good value for money and very edcational.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Unfortunately we allowed only two hours for our visit to this gem of a park. Once we started and saw the wealth of information and exhibits we almost RAN through it to try and cover everything! It is well organized, beautifully set up and included in the (not cheap) admission price is a portable electronic device which gives you detailed information and stories about 30 or so sites around the park (discreet little signs with a number tell you that you should push the button with that number and then you get a recording 1-5mins long) describing your surroundings. It was HOT when we were there in November 2012 but we carried water that could be re-filled at several stations around the park and you get some airconditioned relief at the beautiful ""nocturnal exhibit house"" near the halfway point. If you're in Alice Springs and have a half-day - VISIT THIS PARK!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great to experience outback Australia. Kangaroo were great I spent time on that spot. And the 3:30 show was great. Learn a lot great time to relax and know about .
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,If you want to really understand the desert and its wildlife then this is the place to visit. It's not a particularly long walk around but choose a cloudy day for best comfort. Arrive early for the free flying bird display. (Check times).
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Originally planned a short trip here, stayed all day because it was that interesting. The bird presentation is an absolute must-see. Also enjoyed the desert survival talk. Lots of interesting things to see and I liked the format where you walk around with an audio tour. It is hot this time of year, though, so be prepared to carry water. Unfortunately, cafeteria was closed when we went, so it was fortunate we carried a small amount of food with us. You might want to check the status of the cafeteria if you're going to be here over a meal time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We had arrived that morning in Alice Springs on the Ghan from Darwin and needed to fill in an afternoon. Return transfers were excellent and punctual. Though the weather was hot and dry, the walk around the park was made without difficulty. Staff friendly; excellent maps provided with a commentary which were easy to follow. Wildlife well worth seeing . Other indoor slide shows added to the enjoyment Only downside was cafe was shut. However having our own water negated that. Highly recommended. Anna and David Roberton Auckland.NZ"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Wasn't expecting much but had a really enjoyable time here. The layout is very good with lots of interesting things to see, especially birds and animals. What made it exceptional though was the displays and talks. We went to the bird encounter which was very well done and the bird handler obviously loved his job and it showed. We also went to a talk about the people of the land and how they lived etc. this was very, very interesting and again the quality of the presenter was fantastic. Definately a must do when in Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"While you're in Alice Springs, try and spend a day here. I spent 5 or 6 hours here, and could easily spent longer. The entry price includes a free audio guide, and entry to all the displays and talks- there's something different happening every hour of the day! Highlights for me were the amazing walk-through aviaries (if you're into photography you could spend forever in them!), the nocturnal house, and the cultural talks given by rangers from the local indigenous community. It's not far out of Alice Springs- there is a company that will take you there and bring you back, plus park entry fee for AUS$44, but it's easy enough to drive or cycle...or walk (takes about 1 hour from the centre of town). Take a picnic with you, as the cafe isn't always open."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We expected at least one guide, but there was just a map without any legend. The Indigenous speaker was ok talking about bush medicine. The ""Bird Show"" was a joke, just as Kite & Magpie catching thrown meat. There were other houses to visit but boring. To top it off, back to the Entrance, the cafe was shut so no cold drinks. Ugggggggggg"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Excellent visit. The audio guide helped you along the way It had rained so all the birds were out singing in the rain So many different birds and landscapes Suggest you visit this first on your trip to AliceSprings and the area You are then more aware of things around you to enjoy your trip to Central Australia Allow at least 3 hours.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You'd think this would be another ""tourist trap"", but even for us Aussies, we found the wealth of information about flora and fauna fascinating. Ask any of the friendly guides (especially Matt) a question and they'll be happy to answer. Definitely recommend getting the audio guide, to fill you in on all the details. Allocate a few hours to cover most of what the park has to offer (so bring snacks/food just in case). And go see the bird show, for a close encounter with some birds of prey. Note: some new enclosures are under construction or renovation and may not be marked on the map - but have a wander around - there is plenty to see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very very impressive. The way they have created the different local landscapes (underground rivers, saltpans and forest) is very informative and as you would expect each of these areas attract their own flora and their own wildlife. There are a number of aviaries and although I am not normally a fan of them but those here are very large and allow the birds a normal life. There is even breeding taking place. The nocturnal house is memorable (and dark, so listening to a young person was helpful); easily the biggest we have ever seen. We greatly enjoyed the bird display which showed indigenous birds in action. The audio guides were helpful and allowed the visitors to wander at their own speed. However mine failed halfway round. Despite pointing this out at the reception it was placed in the same basket as the rest. I'm convinced that someone else would have the same problem on the following day. It is expensive for foreigners with the level of the Australian Dollar but was a wonderful introduction to the flora and fauna of the Red Centre. I could not imagine it being done better."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The bird show was geat, the birds fly over your head in the stadium. Lots of animals to look at. Very interesting."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were impressed with the Indiginious talk from one of the woman elders re. bush tucker and mens/womens business and clan integration do's and dont's plus birds of prey talk, plus all the other bird /lizard exhibits"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,You don't have to have kids to enjoy this park. You could spend all day there but we just had a morning. Excellent bush talk followed by a terrific birds of prey show. Best activity I did in all Australia!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The information about what was on and the time of shows and guided walks was non existent .the bird show was fun and well presented . The venues were clean and well constructed, They just need to disseminate information better. Nigelbacon"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This a great opportunity to see animals that you would never see in the wild. The park is well set out and the talks add another dimension to the experience. Don't miss the bird show and the nocturnal house. Only down side is the Cafe. Poorly run so bring your own.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Having just returned from a bush camping trip we had seen lots of desert places so I wasn't sure that a desert park would offer much more. Once there, any doubts were gone, as this place has a fantastic range of wildlife. The park is nice and large with easy walking access everywhere. you get an audio guide and a reference map so you know what you are looking at as you go around the paths. There is a good gift shop too. The nocturnal house is great - we saw bilby, marla, quokka, hopping mice and more. The bird display is really great, especially the raptors that will fly right over you (handy tip: don't sit under the frogmouth owl). There are also several aviaries where you can see lots of the impressive Australian birds. Also the park has free ranging birds so expect to see some lovely ones (the splendid fairy wren was my favourite). We sat down for a break and watched a lace monitor digging for bugs and then taking a bath. We had no car so went for the pick up and return from the hotel. We arrived just after 9am and were just getting our bearings when a worker put up a notice saying ""The cafe is closed today, sorry for any inconvenience"". This left us with a choice of cutting our visit short to return for lunch in town (which at $48 a ticket would have made the park quite expensive) or tough it out and spend the whole day there anyway. We decided to stay and got the 4:15 bus back, and this let us see everything. You need a whole day to see it properly as animals don't always appear 'on cue'. This is why I have rated the park down from excellent. It really isn't acceptable to have tourists miles from anywhere with no transport and inform them that the cafe is closed once they arrive. When I mentioned it to the bus driver on the way back she said 'yeah, they have been having a few problems with the cafe', so it wasn't something that just popped up that day. The staff just seemed to have an 'oh well' attitude about the problem. I reckon they should have taken our lunch orders and sent someone into town to get some sandwiches. I hate to harp on about this, as overall this park is excellent so the cafe problem was quite unexpected."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the park at the end of a 12 day holiday in the region. This was a great time to check what we had seen and ask the questions that were puzzling us on our travels. The park offered a variety landscapes with nAtural vegetation for each region, extensive aviaries were scattered through the park and a great nocturnal house. Talks were on every hour and we were lucky enough to strike it quiet so had the guides to ourselves and ended up personalized tours of the birds of prey and nocturnal house. The park was a great way to end a fantastic holiday in the desert region. The cafe was closed the day we visited and then vending machines seemed to be out of order where ever we were - so take a water bottle."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I would give Alice Springs Desert Park 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that the cafe was closed! Nowhere to buy food and drinks (although there are water fountains in the park, so you won't go thirsty). Apart from this, I loved this park. I arrived before 9.30 am and didn't leave until 2.30 pm, and still didn't see it all. You're given a map and an audio guide upon arrival, which is really useful to listen to as you're wandering around. Lots of information about the desert environment, which is recreated at the park in three distinct areas: Desert Rivers, Sand Country and Woodland. The outdoor bird show is fantastic. The presenter is very knowledgeable, and the birds she describes swoop in on queue; lots of fun for children and adults alike, and plenty of good photo opportunities. The park is full of wildflowers at this time of year (spring) and is very attractive. It was so quiet while I was there that it felt like I was there on my own much of the time. This serenity added to my enjoyment, as I was able to look around at my leisure and listen to the sounds of nature. There are lots of shaded seating areas, so you can sit, rest and reflect. I would have liked to have stayed longer, and if the cafe had been open, I would have had lunch there and stayed longer. It's well worth the entry fee."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spectacular outdoor bird display is a highlight of a visit to this very well presented and operated attraction.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"strangely enough it rained while we were here, the bird show was great but we really loved the nocturnal enclosure"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a very well thought out and educational facility if you have the time and patience to take it all in. It guides you through every type of landscape and microclimate in the outback, and tells you all about the animals and plants, as well as some history of how man interacted with them. There are numerous enclosed areas where you can see a variety of bird species close up, and a rather wonderful nocturnal pavilion where you can see the various snakes, lizards and marsupials that come out only at night. If I have any criticism of this place it's that there's almost too much here. We spent about an hour and a half late in the afternoon, after which my 9-year old was just about burned out with all the intense fact-finding and creature-viewing: if you go with small kids it might be best to be selective and decide at the start which are the 3 or 4 things you want to see most, and stick to those."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,I really enjoyed the bird of prey show and the interpretive talks. The nocturnal house was pretty cool as well you don't realise how many animals only come out at night. Overall it was good value for money and very interesting.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park is not to be missed. Well organised and presented. Heaps of information, very interesting. Lots of shade and water fountains which is critical in the warm weather. It was 35oC when we visited! Depending on how interested you are, you can spend between 2 hours and a full day there. Had a great time there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is great, especially the nocturnal house where you can see various nocturnal creatures hopping about. The live presentations are especially good such as desert animals and desert people."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A world class wildlife park that equals anything we have seen overseas anywhere. A great variety of animals, you may need to go early morning or later afternoon to catch them. Easy paths to wander. Situated at the base of the ranges on the outskirts of town. One not to be missed."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We only had one afternoon/evening in Alice Springs and weren't sure what (if anything) we could fit in. We asked a local resident who was on our flight ""If we can only fit in one thing, what should it be?"" and she recommended this park. She was right! We had about 90 minutes at the end of the day before they closed and we were pleasantly surprised at the beauty and tranquility as we waked around. We unfortunately missed one of the educational videos but did catch an overview. We would definitely recommend this as a stop while in Alice."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,A Microcosm of the entire region within the space of the park on the edge of town. If you don't go here you're letting yourself down!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Has any one been to alice springs and ayers rock. We are going to australia to the lions next june and would like to see them both. We will only have 4 days to spend there, can it be done. Maybe stay in alice and do a day trip to ayers rock."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Such a major, important facility to have to showcase the wildlife, birdlife and culture to our children and for generations of children to come. The bird show was one of the best we have attended - the knowledge and 'passion' of the staff is exceptional. The only negative: the 'sour' staff member (1 only) in the coffee shop who couldnt smile and was most unfriendly - don't know why she was there with that sort of persona & attitude."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We are in awe of the park, its staff. They do an incredible job to have the Desert Park presented professionally and also impart the information to help make the time spent, enjoyable, educational and fun! WOW! The information sessions and bird show were among the best I have ever seen. The movie was also fabulous along with the delightful ending! Not to be missed! The Desert Park is also wheelchair friendly. Even though time allocation may be an issue the Desert Park was worth every minute. We stayed all day and could have gone back for more."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park is sooooooooooo worth the visit! It reveals the secrets of the desert that surrounds Alice Springs. It shows you the flowers that bloom in the desert after it rains, the vegetation in every part the the Red Center, and in the nocturnal pavillion you can actually see the animals that roam the desert at night. Add to that the bird life of the area, and you have the whole picture. It takes two or three hours to do the walks but well worth the effort and the time."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Loved this attraction to bits! Well maintained and very informative. The park is divided into different habitats and one is given an audioguide to help explain each of the zones and the flora and fauna. There are lots of species of birds in aviaries and also flying free. Numerous guide talks/shows are also conducted throughout the day. Many of the talks by local indigenous aussies concerning, desert survival, plants/animals and bush tucker! Do catch the bird show as well! The nocturnal and reptile display also shows many an animal that one would be hard pressed for one to see in the open or without a very keen eye! The little spinifex mice were adorable... The desert park makes for a really nice day out for all. Open air, blue skies and out in nature! What more can one ask for? Do bring hats, water and lots of sunscreen though. Without a doubt, the the number one attraction in Alice Springs!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's great out there, lots of walks to do lots of information in the main building and the functions room has absolutely fantastic food and wine selection"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spent 3 hours here. Could have many more. The displays and exhibitions of birds and other animals were superb. The staff very friendly and informative. This is a must when visiting Alice Springs - probably the number one attraction.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I spent a very long day at Alice Springs Desert Park! The Day/Night ticket is the way to go, if you have time. The first thing that struck me was the fabulous setting ... fabulous views of MacDonnells everywhere! The bird show at Nature Theatre was fantastic. The birds were all familiar to me ... but the information was often new! I also went to another presentation about Aboriginal survival in the desert. I realised that I had to choose between the presentations and the wildlife displays. I would have preferred that the ticket was a two-day re-entry one, so that I could fit everything in! However, I thoroughly enjoyed the nocturnal house, and other displays. Shaded picnic grounds are provided - just as well, since the cafe was inexplicably closed on the day of my visit. I returned at night for the Nocturnal Tour. Fantastic! Although everything seen could also be seen in the Nocturnal House, it was somehow more satisfying to see the animals in real life hopping around my feet! The only disadvantage was the amount of walking involved! Much of that could have been solved if I'd planned my time from the beginning ... but who is that organised?? A thoroughly enjoyable visit!"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This should be a first stop for anyone in Alice. As much or as little info as you want. Immerse yourself or just cruise. Be sure to check out the presentation times; Alison's talk on outback food and survival was a real highlight
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Plan on spending the day but the chances are that you will still miss parts of the park. There is a wonderful bird show - get there early for it. All the events during the day were great.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This Park is well worth a visit and I recommend that you catch all the displays that run throughout the day they were very informitive. You can spend a lot of time here so allow the whole day. The audio makes it very easy to navigate around the park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Birds of Prey show was the best. it allows you to see the birds up close. Make sure you take a time to walk around the park. If you are rushed you miss out on too much. Allow at least half a day and make sure you see the film too :)
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The bird Show was amazing- to see them in full flight, up close & personal. Aboriginal survival skills- Leah was very informative."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,So interesting and so well presented. Brings the desert alive and shows the variety of landscape. The bird exhibits were fantastic - being so close to the birds and the birdsong.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park was very interestig with lots of plants and animal life.The wild bird feeding and exhibition was exceptional, done by a park ranger well worth the look.There are different tracks that can be taken,with what ever kilometers you wish to travel. The movie shown at the end was very informative."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Fantastic walks, displays, etc. the bird show is brilliant. My only disappointment was the evolution rubbish presented in the big movie theatre. When will people understand the beauty of creation?"
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"On our annual pilrimage to Alice Springs, once again we visited the Desert Park. The park is not a zoo therefore there are few animals. They are mainly in the Nocturnal House. Rather, the park is designed to give an overview of the regions, vegetation and bird life of the surrounding areas of Alice - woodland, riverine, claypans and sand, which is does very successfully . The grounds are very well maintained, using flowers and bushes native to arid zones. In addition, the talks given by indiginous rangers on a variety of subjects about life in the arid zones, help to broaden knowledge and understanding of the ways in which people survived before white settlement."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Don't miss this desert park. The staff and Rangers were so friendly and informative. The Bird show was excellent. We also went to an Aboriginal talk which helped explain alot of history. Teens and young kids will enjoy this park.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Get there in time for the bird show - it is fantastic! Don't miss the noctunal display - lots of evil looking snakes and funny little hopping marsupials!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a wonderful look at the fauna and flora of the desert. Lots of walking so don''t forget your water but we enjoyed our time here and the film on the large screen is a must see!
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The rangers are friendly and passionate. The bird show was excellent. A great set up and introduction to the desert region.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The nocturnal house is one of the best I have seen. The bird show was very enjoyable. The park itself provides a wonderful variety of wildlife, landscape and vegetation to view, the video provides and excellent timeline of the area, and the cafe provides good food in a pleasant environment. We did not go to the evening show but I wish we had the time to do so."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We decided to do it like locals and get there by bus, what a bad idea... just take the shuttle or a taxi. It is a 20 min walk from the station. It is probably best to get there in the morning, since most guided tours are before noon. We missed them but the nocturnal house was pretty cool and the bird show was amazing. That in itself is worth a visit. It is twice a day, look it up."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"this place is really great, try to allow most of the day to wander around, get a feel for the place, chat with those who work there."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The whole experience was terrific a must to do again as there was so much to explore.Staff were great.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Don't miss the bird show, whatever you do. The layout of the park is excellent, the variety of desert stuff amazing, the nocturnal house is brilliant, the aviaries quite stunning. Put it at the top of your list in Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Take your time to see all the sights. This was our family favorite, a must see."
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We loved this attraction. The Nocturnal house is great. The bird show was informative. The indigenous talk great.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Lovely spot with ranges in the background. Nice casual walk around park and was very educational and related to our trip around Central Australia. Went to 3.30 bird show and was astounded with the show which was well presented and exciting.
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Beautiful location and worth visiting for an hour or so in morning on way out to ranges. Bird show is one of the most impressive natural presentations we have ever seen - brilliant presenter - get there in time for 10am start. Reptile house is also worth a look. Rest can be missed. Avoid the cafe as very little to buy and coffee was simply awful
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We stayed in the camping area where there are no facilities except drop toilets. But being self-contained that was no problem. The night sky was incredible, even though it was very cold. There is a day use area with wifi nearby and it looked as if some people with caravans or campers were there all night. Not far away is the roadhouse and hotel with a more formal site behind, but this was fully booked. The overflow of caravans stay out in the parking area and apparently the hotel staff allow them to use facilities if they make a donation. But we thoroughly enjoyed the night amongst the marbles!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"What an amazing experience. We took the easy 20 minute walk but there are others you can choose from, I don't know that you see much more than we did. The boulders are very impressive and well worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Hard to imagine that this is just sitting there in the side of the Stuart Highway. Definitely worth stopping in and checking out. It is a brilliant display of nature at work.we were lucky to be there after some pretty heavy rain and even got to see desert crab in the stream behind the marbles. Just brilliant and well worth stopping in to check out.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Literally found our self driving past a sign and took a sharp turn to stop by. There is a viewing car parking and signage at one point but a road permits access slightly further down to see a different perspective. Amusingly there is a collection on the other side of the road too with no fence or restriction! There are warming signs reference paying for the NT parks ticket. If you don’t have one and get caught, you can be fined. FYI. No one there in November which was good but photos don’t do it justice of the balancing act they create."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Unexpected impressive, we visited 2 times one late afternoon which was definitely the best, the colours are stunning, the morning visit was also nice but colour less pronounced."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Superb National park with amazing marbles across a big area. So well presented and curated. Great to see late afternoon
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Popular overnight stop for campers, caravanners and travellers. Sunset and sunrise are lovely. We did most of the walks in the afternoon, picked up sunset from lookout, sunrise then did remaining walk before leaving. I thought the early morning walk was most stunning. Book campsite if staying. There is optus hotspot WiFi available at info shelter. Remember to ensure you have NT Park Permit also if not a local. Campsite $6 pp/night but I believe increasing to $10 in 2024."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"A great spot to have a break, cup of tea and a little explore. Easy to find and park with a caravan for your visit."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),We drove over 400 kms from Alice Springs just to see Devils Marbles. It was a long trip but it was worth the drive. There are numerous trails around and through the Marbles and all fairly easy walks so you could spend quite a while here just wandering around.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Perfect for a little stop off and for a walk to stretch your legs either on the way to Alice or Darwin. Great information about the area. Free wifi at the main info hut too should you need.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),We stayed here overnight it was nice to see the sunset over the rocks and then be able to just walk back to our van. Drop toilet. Large sites. Must book online.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Post Larapinta Trail road trip. Camped overnight at the campsite. Brilliant spot. Lucky to fit in as the place was fully occupied. A kind couple made space to I could squeeze in the hire car and pitch my tent. There is no booking system- first come first served. Honor box payment. Being at the site in the day, the evening and the next morning was special. Some good little trails to walk. Drop toilets did the job. Friendly atmosphere around a communal campfire."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Karlu Karlu (Devils Marbles) We drove from Tennant Creek to be at Karlu Karlu for sunrise – about an hour’s drive. It was well worth the effort to see the colours change as the sun came up. We stopped at the day centre car park and did the easy walk around the Mayijanku Walk about 30 minutes return to the caravan park and back.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"About 100 klms out of Tennant creek on the way to Alice Springs. Definitely worth the stop. These rocks are a sight to be seen, beautiful. Loved the walks on both sides, an easy walk. Can be seen from the highway but definitely worth the stop, you won't be disappointed. Lots of information on the walks and fabulous photo opportunities."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Most has been said in the previous reviews about the serenity of this place and the option to camp here on the long journey between Alice Springs and the North. It is a calm, spiritual place while at the same time offering spectacular rock formations. Sunset is particularly nice as the birds flutter around and the atmosphere is so peaceful. Our end of day experience was spoilt by one person and his rather large drone. The birds took off in flight and the rest of us had to endure the loud mechanical noise and the sight of the drone crossing in front of what should have been a very special experience. This is no place for drones."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Was a nice sight to see. After seeing casts of nothing for Klms this was a lovely stop. Amazing how all these lovely weird shape rocks balancing all in one area. Has tracks to walk, camping sight, toilets and picnic areas. We had driven to camp but as no one else there, wife was little scared lol as camping sight right at back away from road, so we drove on after little look around. Very cheap camping with payment to be left in honesty box."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Good place to get some memorable sunset photos. Not the best place to be during the middle of the day as the heat and flies can get a bit much, especially with small kids. Would be worth a sunrise visit as well. Has free camping but there are no showers or shade."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We overnighted with our camper in the national parks campground here: there are two locations where you can camp and both are very popular with passing caravaners and campers. You need to get here early to secure a location. The campground has pit toilets, tables and fire pits as well as spectral views of the Devil’s Marbles themselves. There are a number of well-market walking trails in the area that allows for great exploration of the site: sunup and sundown can be quite spectacular. A great overnight stop that should be included by all first time travellers to the region."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Such an interesting and wondrous place which is a must to visit in the Territory. You can camp here or simply visit on a day trip. Toilet facilities are clean and absolutely love this mysterious area. You can travel the world but never see this really strange phenomenon. Take your time to really experience this absolutely incredible place.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Visited here on way to Darwin. Awesome name for these groups of stones. Took lots of pics and had a walk around whilst we were there. Take some time out whilst on your travels and visit
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Unbelievably nestled in the outback is this magnificent outcrop of natures marbles. Never did I imagine there were so many and varying sizes. There are 5 different walks to take in the splendour. Slightly seen from the road but once you go into the area wow. Drive down to the Day use area and park, picnic tables and drop toilet, or around ton the camp ground for overnighters. We did the walk to, and climbed the Nyanjiki lookout. Wasn't too difficult. But the view was lovely. Awesome experience. So worth a trip. We were staying at Tennant Creek and only an hours drive."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Massive rocks in the middle of nowhere. It's a nice opportunity to stop and have a nice rest if you are traveling on the Highway and at the same time to take a couple of nice pictures of Australian outback.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),We intended to stay one night but did two. Walking around the rocks and their formations is marvellous. Recommended
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Was staying just down the road at the Devils Marbles Hotel so visited this place on the way down from Tennant creek and back 9klm for sunset. The location is just amasing the way the rocks are balanced everywhere and if you want to see the split rock go round the back in the main parking area and turn left it is just an amasing site (photo attached). There are toilets and information boards in the main parking area with FREE Wifi there too. Don't just stop at the entrance it is spaced over a large area and you can just do a full loop to get back on the main road. Would recommend this at sunset as the rock colours really do change
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),This is a great stopover for awesome photos and a fantastic place for kids to wander around safely whilst admiring Mother Nature's wonderful creations.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We didn't have alot of time to spare so opted for the shortest walk about the Devils Marbles which took about 15 minutes. Can see plenty just looking about but if you have the time, take the longer walk to the bigger area as I think there'd be some good views from some places on those walks. There is also a car park lookout further along the road."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Enjoyed this place in past but now couldn't stay because of our friend's dog. I was bemused by the slot for fees at a newish camping ground. No cost displayed and no phone cover. No facilities except drop toilet. No toilet dump. Even the wider areas on side of road said no camping. This area is now under strict control with fences everywhere and requests not to climb.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We visited late afternoon and again early morning and highly recommend visiting at either or both times for the best light. We had seen photos of the Devil's Marbles and assumed that it was a small cluster of boulders but it is quite an extensive area, most of which is accessible on foot (some areas are barred for various reasons). The boulders come in many shapes and sizes, some balancing on others - a really interesting sight."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),We thought the Devils Marbles were excellent and well worth the stop. The story board and dreamtimes boards and info about their formation was great. Especially liked the directive to not climb on the boulders. Some unrespectful gits chose to ignore this and climbed anyway. Hope bad dreams come to them. I had to wait 17 minutes for one idiot to get off so I could take a good photo. Lots of caravaners. Good parking. Clean toilet. Lookout point. Camping site down further.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We have been here several times, towards sunset and also in midmorning. It is a fascinating place. Take your camera and try to be there either early in the day or later in the afternoon for best viewing and photos."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We stopped for a while to visit these iconic formations. The road is a 2 km loop of the Stuart Highway in NT. it about 100kms from Tennant Creek, There is a campground, must be self contained or a day use centre.."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Great place to stop for a night - lots of flies during the warmer months. Plenty of space. Have stayed several times and always enjoy the walk in the morning.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),We loved this place. Amazing feel. Camped the night. Stars. Clear sky’s. Flies a worry during the day and early morning. Plan to arrive early if you have a bug rig as its park where u want. Loved the walks. Great place to visit
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),This natural attraction should not be missed. You can either sit and admire them or take several different walks around them.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),This is such an awesome photo stop. Don't forget your flynet though. We did 3 of the self guided walks around through and up the rocks. The climb to the lookout gives breathtaking views of not only the Marbles but also the surrounding countryside. Thank you to the traditional owners for opening this area up for us to experience
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Just off the Stuart Hwy on a sealed road, 2wd access no issue. You can even walk your dog in the car park area. Fascinating geological feature. No cost. Easy to photograph. Flat and easy to traverse and ambulate about. Suitable for ♿ access. A must stop and see."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),After visit Alice spring my family wanted to explore devil marbles. So fantastic and great place to take pictures.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),What an amazing place. We arrived for sunset and were treated to a lightning display at magic hour. Great little camp site for just a few bucks a night. Good little fireplaces and serenity of no Generators. A must stop on the great Red Centre drive!
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"This is a very unique natural wonder to see. Huge bolders balanced on top of each other. There is a basic camping area here with drop toilets. However, it does get crowded. The Devil Marbles hotel, 10 km South is a good alternative."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Fantastic place to visit spectacular rock formations it’s hard to believe they are just resting on top,of each other the walks are interesting and well trodden paths take water and a campers. Amongst the boulders we found a perfect natural cave come house doorway court yard with two small trees window large room. I would think a perfect stop over for Aborigines passing through It is very close to the camping area see if you can find it 🤔"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"What a magical place. There is nothing like it elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately spoilt by backpacker and local indigenous rubbish left around the place. Evidence of campfires on road edges for God's sake, toilets smelly and dirty, walking track signs falling out of the ground, and a general lack of being cared for. I thought this was a special sacred place for the local Aboriginal people? Why are they not looking after it??"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Stop at the caravan park behind Wauchope pub,, fantastic little oasis, with fantastic food, pool and beer garden,. This is how it's done properly, about time the rest of the outback steps up to this standard"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"This is only ten minutes off the Stuart Highway and is definitely worth a visit. Giant boulders perched on rocks and other boulders in seemingly impossible positions. Loads of great photo opportunities, worth a sunset visit too. Very sacred to the aborigines so they request you don’t take photos of some of the rocks"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"After hearing of these rocks I had to visit, I certainly was not disappointed. There is a toilet there, access is easy from the highway. There are a range of short and long walks you can do. Plenty of information for you to read. Must visit place."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Such an incredible sight! Plenty of information about how they were formed, a path going around them, even an area to follow so you can get a stunning view. Stick to the paths to preserve this amazing place and take plenty of photos and enjoy the beauty of it!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"A beautiful spot and a great place to camp, only downside is drop dunnies are a bit stinky. Campground was packed, get there early for a good spot!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Do please stop in. Please do not be a jerk an d not read the signs. Do you really need a pic on that small rock. no. This is a really great place. You feel very spiritual here
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Very interesting geological feature with sacred significance to the local indigenous. The associate stories are interesting. Minimal associated facilities.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),What an amazing place and to be able to camp right next to them truely amazing the colours and contrasts unbelievable.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Amazing scenery, camp up for the night, large camp site $3.30 per person watch the setting sun on the rocks changing colour and have a walk round the well marked track"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),After a wonderful night at the Devils Marbles Hotel free park at the front of the Pub and having a great meal we headed off early next day. Guess what most had left the Devils Marbles and we had a very casual track around a wonderful tourist venue. Thanks to the wonderful Rangers they keep it in fabulous standards for tourists.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Wow, wow, wow!. Absolutely loved the free camping and the opportunity to visit this site. But get there early in the day as it is really popular and was almost full at 2.30pm. A magical site."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"An experience well worth the time to view. A great Campground too that was certainly well utilised. Walking around the 5 various 'well sign posted' trails is one thing that must be done. Choosing a short 30 minute walk or the walk that is just over an hour and a half, you will be absorbed by the many formations and significance this area has. If you have the opportunity to do a sunrise or sunset (or both) viewing of the Devil's Marbles, it will be another stunning experience."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We stayed at the campground, which gives you the chance to be there at sunrise and sunset. Well worth the visit."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"If you are driving between Alice Springs and Tennant Creek, definitely take the 2km detour off the highway and stop and marvel at this natural wonder."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"I can't imagine you travel here just see the boulders, but for me this is a must stop on any journey past. We arrived at the campsite (basic but very cheap - only a drop toilet facility) just before sunset. I have to say it was very busy but we got our campervan parked and had a view of the boulders as the sun fell. It was a very magical and spiritual experience. We also got up before sunrise to watch the sun coming up and the colour change (the children were thinking more like a disney style multi-coloured change with Tinkerbell dancing on the rocks rather than differing hues of red but never mind!). We had a lovely walk round in the morning while the sun rise and even though I would say the campground was at full capacity, we didn't really see anyone else around and it was very peaceful. A definate worthwhile overnight stop for me."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),This was another tick off the bucket list just for the shear size and story behind the devils marbles. Kids enjoyed it but sadly not the heat
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"In the middle of nowhere suddenly you see the Devils Marbles. At sunset (and sunrise) you see the red colors glowing. When we were there, no one else was there so it made our visit more special. There’s also a campsite, unpowered. Because it was too hot we decided to stay somewhere else. Near the visitor center they have free WiFi."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"The boulders were boring and everything was dry, the scenery was basic and ugly hated it! The drive was so long and boring and the outcome was rubbish I took my family with kids ranging from 7-18 and none of them enjoyed it, my oldest really liked nature and all that so suprised she hated it. SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND DONT VISIT!!!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"If your travelling through the Norther Territory, its worth stopping at the Devils Marbles. You can camp overnight (but can be crowded during peak times of the year) or you can stop and spend a couple of hours looking around. If you want to get some great photos, make sure to go early in the morning or late in the afternoon, as the rising or setting sun brings out the orange and red in the rocks. You could easily spend a couple of hours looking around the area, the rock formations are spread out."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"A must stop between Alice Springs and Tennant Creek, literally in the middle of no where! The place was deserted when we visited, and it was pretty amazing having the entire place to ourselves. Well, just us and the thousands of flies! There is no shade or rest area here, but you can camp here, wood fire BBQ and a long drop toilet. The rocks are amazing, so many different formations and shapes. You have to be amongst them to truly appreciate the size and wonder of these rocks."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Amazing rock formations to visit between when travelling. Plenty of parking, no water. Reasonable tourist information on billboards Caravan parking area near Devils Marbles was full .. even at 2pm in the afternoon with overbite stoppers. Get there early !"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"You have to stop and walk around the Marbles, they are fascinating. Seeing them at sunset is a must!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"It was winter but still really hot, the scorching sun made everything look like it was on fire due to the red dirt. I wasn't prepared for the shear size of some of the formations. Was nice to have a walk around and marvel at natures uniqueness. Some people were climbing to the top but I'm not sure how safe that was. There were also workers constructing a shelter/BBQ area when we visited so it would be an even better place to stop for some refreshments once that is completed. Really cool place to visit though."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"What a sight to see! An absolutely amazing place, with sufficient information regarding traditional custodians."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"if you are driving between Tennant Creek and Alice Springs call in as you don't have to go out of your way, you can see them from the highway but pull in and walk around them they are huge, some look like they have been sliced down the middle or had slivers sliced off them, others are balanced on top of other boulders looking like they just might fall."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Amazing array of boulders, we were going to stop there but found it full of vans and campers which spoiled the vista. but I visited 7 years ago and you there were no fences and you could walk around the rocks. The magic of the area seems to be reduced by crowded vans. I could not even get a panoramic photo without a camper in it. They should move the camping area away from the boulders."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Outstanding landscape, you have to see it to believe it, once you read up about the geology it all becomes clear. This is definitely a must see, and only 8 minutes from the devils marbles hotel a place you must stay at."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),beautiful sunrise worth getting up early after a quite night at the campground! Important: clean toilets!!!
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Devils Marbles, another very cool natural experience. Similar to Uluru where there is nothing surrounding them only small shrubs and tree. No Mountains or hills or other rocks. Just incredible, looks as if they have been dropped and placed there from the sky. Definitely need some time to walk around them to have a proper look. They are incredible."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),What a great and easy to access natural wonder. Right by the highway you can't miss it. We stayed overnight in the campground. $7.70 for our family of 4. No power or water but there is a toilet and campfires allowed in designated campfire areas. Kids throughoughly enjoyed exploring the area. Sunset and sunrise over the boulder was beautiful. It's a must visit.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Travelling around Australia passed this site on the way to Uluru so on the way back we called in, what an amazing place. You can stay here for a small price, there are fire pits and toilets. A good site that would hold around 20 caravans so if traveling through call in for a photo opportunity or park up and stay the night."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),If you are travelling in Central Australia make sure you allow time to walk around and through the Devils Marbles.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Passed through hoping to stay the night but was already full at around 3pm in the afternoon. The area has so many tables and odd chairs scattered everywhere taking up so much room. These should be removed so more campers can fit in. Beautiful sunset photos but be careful walking around the area as the rangers don't like it
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We popped past on advice of my friends BF, I hadn't heard much about this amazing sight but I am sure glad we did. It's really run climbing and checking out the spectacular views from the top of the rocks. An ideal place to stop and camp if you have a caravan."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Karlu Karlu is a fantastic place especially at sunrise and sunset but sadly this yet another great location ruined by caravenners. Driving in to the campground was like driving into a caravan show. I set up in one of the two remaining available spots (it's a popular place) and set up my tent. I was the only person in a tent there). Once night fell the tranquility of the whole place was ruined. There seemed to be a competition among the caravanners to see who could outdo each other with all manner of LED lights and light ropes shining. And then there was the noise from the TVs and radios. The facilities at the campground were find and access to the Devil's Marbles is easy. I'd love to go again to see the night sky but doubt it would be any better. Don't stay overnight if you want peace and quiet.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),25 mins from Wycliffe Well. Great for photos and an easy walk around. I believe you can stay here in the camp ground but didn't see any amenities. I spent 3 hours walking around and had a great time.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),You may well think that these rocks have been placed in position by hand but it is the result of soil erosion that has exposed them. A remarkable sight.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"I strongly recommend arriving here before sunrise to catch the amazing light that floods across the marbles - great photo opportunity! Also, I imagine it gets quite busy, so by behind here early in the morning you have them all for yourselves apart from the ones who have chose to stay over night. They are in certain designated areas so it won't be a bother - the place is huge to share."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"You need to see this place , its great and the colors are fantastic, you can camp here as well , did not get to spend enough time here"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We stopped at the marbles on our way to Alice Springs from Tennant Creek. The Marbles are great to see. There are information boards at the parking area explaining the cultural significance which was interesting to read, and a gravel walking trail around the marbles themselves. There is also free Wi-Fi which is a bonus!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Super cheap camping in amongst the devil's marbles. Only pit toilets, but many of them and clean. No other facilities except tables. and fire pits. The information signs are good and the walks around the site are interesting."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We stopped for the night at Karlu-Karlu on our way north from Alice Springs to Darwin. It was easily reachable in a day (about 4 hours drive) from Alice Springs. We camped in the camping area behind the rock formation - we were camped right at the base of one of the large rock areas, it was one of the most amazing campsites we experienced on our trip. The cost was low too - $3.30 per adult, or $7.70 for a family. There is a fairly decent drop toilet, and room for about 40 vans to set up to camp. There are also informative signs around explaining the history and formation of the area. At the information boards over at the day stay area there is (not very strong) free wifi. The rocks themselves are incredible. We wandered on pathways through and around the rocks and marvelled at the way they are balanced on top of each other and how varied and interesting each different stack is. There was a lot to explore. At sunset we went to the western side of the rocks and watched them turn more and more red, it was amazing. At night time the sky was clear and the stars so bright, with the rocks looming above our campsite. In the morning we saw sunrise over the rocks which was awe inspiring as well (we were lucky too and had rainbows in the sky to the west, which looked like they were rising out of the rocks). It was one of our most enjoyable and spectacular one night stops and I'd recommend everyone at least stop for a quick wander around as they drive up or down the Stuart Highway."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Have done all the NT attractions and I reckon this place is right up there with the best. I didn't realise the magnitude of the area, truly amazing, should be publicised more"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We stopped at the marbles for lunch and had a wander round. There are information boards at the parking area explaining the geology and cultural significance which was interesting to read, and a level, gravel walking trail around the marbles themselves. There is also free Wi-Fi which is a bonus!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"This is a marvelous place, to explore. Lots of fantastic stone ""sculptures"" a must see on the Stuart Highway."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"It's well worth taking a break from the highway to visit this area. It's an amazing area, really beautiful and very peaceful. There's a decent campground there too."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Love nature in Central Australia.....this place still amazes me on hour they just sit there....great at sunset.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We travelled to the Devils Marbles in December. The good thing was we had no competition for a position to park our caravan. The only bad point was the heat! It was our fault for visiting at that time of year!! The camping area is clean and well laid out with plenty of shelters. You need to be self supporting because there are no toilets, water or power."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"If you have the chance: be there in the afternoon before and for sunset. Take photos of the same spot in daylight/afternoon, sunset and at night.....THE MOST MAGIC PLACE in Australia (esp. since it s a bit out of the way, meaning not too crowded!), but try to spend the night there on the (very basic, but inspiring) campside right in between. The kids (10,12) loved it, we too."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Interesting place to visit with informative signage. We had the place to ourselves and it was very tranquil. Low cost camping on site and surprisingly free wifi.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),If you are heading in the Stuart Highway between Alice Springs and Darwin be sure to take the side road to the Devils Marbles. You can't get lost and the road is a big U shape which will bring you back to the main road. As you head toward these impressive stones you see why people make detour. They are strangely balanced on top of each other and have been eroded to make them into massive round boulders. We didn't camp overnight but others did.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Gorgeous location. I would think it would be impossible to take a bad photo here. The rock and sky colours are amazing. Well sign posted. Lots of places to walk around. Worth visiting for sunset and sunrise to see the different colours!!
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Don't just drive by, spend the night at the camp ground $3.30 per person and enjoy the sunset . Remember to collect firewood before entering the camp ground and marbles."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Make sure you get out of your car and explore. Stunning view in the afternoon. Formations are much bigger than you think.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"This is such an amazing place. Was disappointed to see people climbing on the rocks, it felt like a sacred place. Beautiful, will be back...."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We were travelling to Alice Springs from Tennant Creek and did not know about Karlu Karlu, so we were amazed as we started to see the rocks as we drove down the highway. It is fantastic to be able to walk around the rocks and see at close range the geology of the area."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Amazing rock sculptures! Over the past few years they have crumbled a bit. Great spot to camp before Alice Springs and 100kms out of Tennant Creek. Recommend getting there around 3pm for a decent spot to camp.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),We visited with 2 young children and loved it. It was spectacular at sunset and there is basic camping facilities there. You can walk around exploring on your own.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Spent one night and it was amazing. Need to arrive before 3.00pm to obtain a spot. National Park fees at $3.30 per person per night with toilets supplied. Must stop for a magical experieince.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Could not believe what I was seeing. The rocks are amazing. Hard to imagine how they can be formed like they are. The colour of the marbles seem to change all the time. Lots of people viewing , people climbing over the rocks everywhere. In the little stream I found 2 frogs."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Beautiful place, and the feeling is serene. The toilet facilities are adequate for the location. If you want a campsite get there early as most spots are filled by early afternoon. It is just a pity that some people don't respect the request of the traditional owners for people not to climb the Marbles as it totally ruins the effect especially at sunset and sunrise. A must do destination."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We camped the night here, it is inexpensive for 3 adults and 2 kids & there are toilets, Sunset view was incredible and we loved it"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Take an extra ten minutes and drive through to see this ancient wonderland. It is just off the highway.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Bit let down by this. Had always wanted to go and just felt that it wasn't what I had imagined. That said, we did visit after going to Uluru, Olgas and Kings Canyon so anything after seeing those wouldn't be as great as it could be. Stop in if you're going by but I wouldn't make a special trip"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Really breathtaking place, stunning sunset captured. Wouldn't advise camping as way too busy- there were caravans and tents for days which I find rather off putting."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"100% worth a stop on the way to/from Alice, it's not a huge area and was amazing to see the huge rocks balanced, and the ones that were split down the middle. Information boards were informative and there is a small 10 min walk around them. Marking it down from a 5 only because the toilets are woeful, they're just drop toilets which is fine, but so dirty and the taps outside didn't work so had to go back to the car to wash up. There's heaps of roadhouses close by so just go there."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),You have to see these rocks. This is one of the best FREE attractions in Aus. Photos are great any time of day.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Amazing and magical place. We went at sunset to take photos, which was well worth the stop. Highly recommend. Great national park toilets and benches. An excellent example of brilliant red rock formations and the wonders of Mother Nature."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"With hundreds of kilometers of almost barren surroundings, Karlu Karlu makes for a nice spot to set up the tent and enjoy both the sunset and the sunrise while you observe the changing colors on the rocks. Having said that, I would not come here on purpose -not that much to see and too far away from everything. Another downside is the lack of respect that caravaners and campervanners show to the only tents area -arrive well before sunset if you want a spot. At least, the free generators zone was respected."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Get in early as the Grey Nomads infest the place by early afternoon. Bring your camera as the sunset and sunrise are great times for photographs. Cost per person $3.30 into the honesty box. Basic long drop toilets are the only facilities.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Loved it as a quick stop over. Enjoyed the history and info on the boards while walking and loved being able to climb the rock's
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),We arrived at around 4.30 in time to spend an hour or so with the rocks at sunset time. The colours were amazing and the whole area was a very special place. We were able to get a place in the campground which cost only $7.70 for a family! Facilities very basic with only a drop toilet and no drinking water available. We were lucky to share a fire with another couple and enjoyed our evening under the stars. We spent another hour or so in the morning looking at more of the rock formations. My favourite camp experience in the Northern Territory.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Wow we found some marbles, perfectly shaped rocks in the middle of no where. Definitely worth a visit. Some sections they ask you not to climb on just keep an eye out for the signs. Take sunscreen a hat and wear good walking shoes. We didn't see it at sunrise but I am sure it would be beautiful."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"The contrast between the rocks and the sky is stunning, especially early in the morning or late afternoon. A large campground with fire places and bbq's, as well as toilets."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We camped here and loved it. Really great place to see the sun rise and set. If you are going to climb make sure you wear sensible shoes or go bare foot. There is WiFi near the toilets, please note there is no phone signal."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Beautiful place to visit. We drove through after having lunch up the road. Lots of paths to walk through the Marbles and take a closer look. Some in our small group found it spooky and others found it positive and uplifting. There is lots of information about the place and a campsite to stay the night. 0
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Worth getting up early to see the sunrise - incredible how those rocks stay perched on top of others . A large area to see but could do with better paths , we were conscious of not walking on the sacred site as requested but the paths weren't clear ."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Love this place about 100kms south of Tennant Creek, NT. You could crawl all over them with ease and they are great to see at sunset. If you are staying at the adjoining campground (behind them) it is recommended that you to come by early afternoon or you may not get a spot. If you miss out as we did, then there is a lovely night rest spot about 15kms north on the Stuart Hwy (it's next to a windmill on the left that is next to a bridge that's going over Bonnie Creek) PS. There is also has free wifi in the Devils Marbels campground."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"You can take dogs with you but make sure they are on a lead, I noticed a couple there with no lead and no collar on their dog. Great to look around and read about how they were formed and why."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Location They are located close to the highway on what looks like the old highway. The down side is they are a long way from anywhere but very convenient if travelling from Tennant Creek to Alice Springs. Service n/a Value n/a - free Atmosphere These are amazing formations but they are really at their best at sunset or sunrise. If passing this way make sure you stop. The side road goes through the middle of the formation so no long walks, etc needed. Overall If you are in the are definitely stop for a look. There is free camping nearby and a pub with cabins, rooms and camping 10 km down the road at Devils Marbles Hotel."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"There's not much to the marbles, just a few walks and a drop toilet (use so you don't have to use Wycliffe wells bathroom). Absolutely beautiful, gigantic rocks just sitting on top of each other. Good spot for a picnic, the flys weren't even that bad"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We appreciated the basic, natural, cheap and beautiful campsite. Great viewing spot for the sunset and sunrise."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Photos don't do justice to places like this. It really is pretty amazing and cool. Great place to stop, leg stretch, let the kiddies climb to get some energy out before hitting the road again!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"The granite outcrops are in big contrast to the otherwise long, flat landscape. Just off the road good for young and old to stretch a leg and feel the isolation. Some free camp but not sure its really allowed?"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),There is so much more to this site than you see in photos! The boulders go for miles. They were fascinating to walk/climb around. Must see!
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"A fantastic spot in the middle of no where; it takes a great effort to arrive here, but you will be very happy when you see it!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Whilst travelling the outback its definitely worth making a short detour to see the Devils Marbles. This weird and obscure formation of rocks is basically in the middle of nowhere and worth the detour for a photo opportunity, after all you probably wont venture down this stretch of road too often. Sunrise and sunset are key times for pictures but just be aware of travel times to your destination. You don't want to drive at night because there are Kangaroos and other wild animals that will cause your can some serious damage if hit."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Don't miss the field of huge red boulders right beside the road between Tennant Creek and Alice Springs. Trails to most of the more interesting ones and they are short, which was a good thing because it was very hot in the desert sun. Very photogenic rocks."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),It is so easy to stop here on your way to Uluru that you would be mad to miss it. After driving for hours through the desert you are met with this awesome sight of huge rocks piled upon each other like a tower of pebbles. It takes just a few minutes to drive off of the highway to go see and is really worth it. There's no information centre but plenty of information as you walk around to describe what you see. There is free wifi as you are encouraged to share your experience online too! The walks are flat and short with the car park right next to the main area to see so you don't have to travel far at all.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Stay at devils marbles hotel a 5 minute drive away. See sunrise and sunset. Awe inspiring. Heat and flies a pain in mid summer. Use fly or mozzie hat. Respect the site. It will blow your mind. Do not think u can stay in tennant creek and do a quick visit as its 110 km away.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Great place to explore, and a lot of interesting information to read. Great camping facilities, has all the basics and everything you need"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Ahhhh where to start? This just blew our minds. Not to be missed, we absolutely loved the Devils Marbles."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"The marbles were not along our original drive path as we had to turn off before reaching there but we were so glad we decided to go out of our way and have a look. Some of the marbles are along the Stuart Highway so you don't even have to get out of your car if you don't want to. It's amazing to see in person, and also great to stretch your legs after a long drive. It's very interesting and great for taking photos. Definitely worth a visit!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"The kids loved scrambling around the rocks. may be considered culturally inappropriate, but after a couple of hours in the car it was a welcome break and we saw no signs prohibiting climbing. The gum trees look lovely against the rocks, which are interesting to see."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Amazing rock formations. Well worth exploring. Not out of the way at all! Don't need to get out of your car at all if you don't wish too, but I would recommend to do so."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"I hadn't realised there were so many marbles strewn across several acres - generally, it's the same ones that appear online or on postcards. It's a fascinating and beautiful place, especially at sunrise/sunset. Give yourself enough time to explore, or stay a night at the Devils Marbles Hotel - fantastic place with a very decent restaurant - you won't do better."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),...you are driving from Darwin to Alice Springs. It is only a short way from the Stuart Highway and you can take spectacular photos
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),I've heard about this place but couldn't believe my eyes. The sheer size of these boulders and the way they are just perched or resting on others is incredible. Was just passing through but we will spend more time on the way back to do the walks. Husband was standing on one of the rocks....looked down at his shadow and thought.....'selfie'. Don't think he quite got the idea but funny anyway. They have a free wifi spot for you to post your best photo experience at Devil's Marbles too. Great idea.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"This place is fantastic. After already visiting Uluru and the The Olgas I can honestly say that this natural wonder was my favourite. We visited for sunset one day then went back for an early morning picnic on the rocks the next. There are spots for basic camping if you want to stay overnight and public toilets available on both sides of the road. Interestingly there is also free wifi at the hut on the smaller side of the marbles. So a great place to skype home from if you have been without for some time. I truly hope that I can return here one day and stay overnight, it is such a wonderful spot."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),After a long day of travelling we stayed behind the Devil's Marbles. Very quiet and serene and an amazing sunset over the stunning rock formation. Great walks also.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Very bizarre rock formations, definitely worth the stop to spend looking around these rocks and learning a bit of their history."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),I grew up seeing pictures of this geological phenomenon in my textbooks and have always wanted to come here. The site was huge and we wandered happily here at sunset and took some fabulous photos. If you camped here you could get some great sunrise photos or sillouhettes against the starry night sky.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),The Devils Marbles are definitely worth a look. Our group of 14 adults and 13 children (aged 3 - 13) spent almost 3 hours exploring the rocks. I would be more than happy to visit again as there is still so much more to see... I never would have thought that rocks would be so interesting!
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"This place is amazing. Stayed overnight and watched the sun rise. Breathtaking! Even the kids were impressed, it's a great place to explore and play. A destination in itself, blown away!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"I think this is a must see if travelling through. We stayed in the campground ($7.70 for a family) and got to experience the boulders changing colours, orange/reds to purple/pink reds over the afternoon and for sunset. Great chance for fantastic sunset photos and very peaceful surroundings, even with many other campers around. The only downside was the non-flushing amenities were in need of pumping and the smell was difficult to face when needing them."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"You cannot drive past this without stopping. Now able to camp here - although we didn't this time. Great scenery and they now have wi-fi to upload your travel photos straight away! Plenty of parking, even for vans, good stop for lunch if you've got it with you. No kiosk or anything - which is good, but toilets and shade."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),BUT walking around the rocks (marbles) and the campsite so many so much to see. great for star gazing and the sunsets on the Orange rocks were fantastic. No showers and BYO water Drop toilet is provided. There were nearly 40 camps set up the night I stayed
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Had a great time there. It is easily accessed from the highway. It was great for us as we stayed at the Wauchope hotel, which was fantastic by the way. The rock formations are fabulous and we took some great pictures."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"What a special place this is for either a quick stop or a camping spot in the great camping ground. Our children were 8,6 & 3 and all loved the rock formations."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"A must see in the N.T. the Devils Marbles is on the main Stuart Highway and the detour is also bitumen, The main area now has free WiFi so you can share your photos with your friends."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"No need to dedicate a day to visit this place, we drove out from Tennant Creek to check them out and back, to only drive past them again to go to Alice Springs. I recommend all that is needed is a quick (20-30mins approx.) stop on your way to either township. Their formation is pretty impressive though."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),We camped overnight here recently and really enjoyed it. The marbles are so fascinating and the kids spent hours exploring. Arrive as early as possible to get a good campsite and enjoy the sunset from the top of the marbles. Highly recommend a stop here.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Amazing nature place on the long road from Uluru to Darwin. Stretch the leg do some walking and climbing. Great spot for some Sunrise or sunset drinks but unfortunately several people do not now how to behave and broken glass is all over the place. Will not take long until they but a glass ban to the place same as in other great spots in NT.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We stopped off at this site on our way to Tennant Creek. We were pleased to find that it is just off the road, actually visible from the highway. Amazing rock formations!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Stopped by here not really knowing what we were in for.Little did we know what a surprise we were in for. You can stroll around the rocks at your own speed. There is a static display to explain how the rocks were formed and the history of the area. Its great to be able to get photos of the rocks from every possible angle. Watch out for the snakes in the long grass though.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"I love this place, and for me, very spiritual. Every time I visit, I do a different walk, and get heaps of photos, this time was not exception. I can't recommend this highly enough."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We had seen photos of these bolders however were surprised when we arrived and saw the huge area they covered. Don't drive past without calling in to see this natural wonder. We stayed at Wauchope Hotel overnight which allowed us to make late evening and morning visits to the marbles, both is a good time to visit. Caravans can stay in the park overnight for a small charge."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Visit later in the day near sun set if you can for the best pictures, and stroll around. Stunning site and marvel at the large boulders and the way they balance on each other. There is also a free wifi hot spot. A good free camping area is at the rear of Devils Marbles or it is a 20 minute drive from Wycliffe Well Holiday Park."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Lovely place to see and very beautiful romantic place to watch the sun come up. Even if you are just driving past it is a must to see
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"This is a stop just off the highway between Darwin and Alice Springs, the rocks are a very neat sight to see and great for pictures, it's also a good reason to get out and give the legs a stretch on the never ending drive down the middle! Beware the 10000000 flies of the outback!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Awesome is the best to describe the Devils marbles. Take water with you as you explore thus natural wonder!!!
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"You carn't go past this it is amazing to see these huge boulders out in the middle of no ware, we stayed over night at the caravan park there is a toilet but no showers for a small fee, after going there we took our Son there to show him and it was one of the high lights of our trip to Darwin we walked around all afternoon taking photos then watched the sun go down, it was such a beautiful sky, pitch black at night so all the stars shone so brightly then up early to see the sun rise, it truly is the most interesting and one of the most scenic places to visit in Australia loved every minute of the magical place, o yea and we never got one bad photo happy travelling"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Defiantly a must for everyone!! An absolutely mesmerising site in our beautiful country. The sun hits the rocks at different angles throughout the day and it feels like the landscape is changing! Just glorious
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Devil's Marbles are most certainly worth stopping to see when travelling along the Stuart Highway in the Northern Territories. There are a couple of car parks, one near the highway and one around the back for overnight campers. There is no fee to visit these boulders of varying sizes scattered over quite a large area. We visited midday and the colour of the rocks set well against the blue sky. I would imagine it is a great place to be at sunrise or sunset. You can walk freely amongst the boulders and it is possible to climb some of them. There is information displayed with the Aboriginal story of the Marbles."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We luckily past it at sunset time, which gives the rocks nice colors but I must confess that after Uluru, Olgas, Kings Canyon... you get a bit sick of seing red rocks."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"This is the perfect overnight stop in between Alice Springs and Katherine (we were advised not to stay at Tennant Creek and we’re glad we didn’t). This is bush camping at its best – simple, unpowered sites with fire places and pit toilets. No water or firewood supplied. Generators not permitted. Keep in mind it’s dirt, hot, and flies/dingoes are present! It’s a must do to see the sun set on the marbles – very pretty indeed! Only $6.60/night"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Stay overnight, that way you can catch both the sunset and sunrise on the marbles. Both times of the day offer some great photo opportunities. Camp fees apply here because it is a national park. Approx $7 pp p.n."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),This is a must stop for both sunset and sunrise. It is almost mystical and spiritual as it was very quiet and beautiful
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),just visit shortly after sunrise or just before sunset...much better in these hours. take at least an hour to walk around them. fantastic.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Such an amazing place that is very accessible. We camped one night and kids were fascinated by a Dingo that was sleeping in the shade of the information hut. The Dingo stayed until the campground became quite busy. He then returned the next morning. Kids burned off energy climbing all over the rocks so slept well. Cost was $7.70 for a family. Toilets (pit) are a bit smelly. The toilet further away was the better one as used less. Very popular place for backpackers.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Just a very short distance from the main highway, and well worth a visit. They even have camp sites here."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),You're on the only road around. You literally drive right past the things. Do yourself a favor and pull in for a look. We got there at sunset and the pics we took were great. Camped the night for a small 'honesty box' fee of $5 or so and woke to a pretty impressive view. Some of the formations defy logic. Only downside were the flies. Bang on sunrise they were out in droves.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Interesting and incredibly photogenic boulders in a field of low grass. Easy to walk around or scramble over. Some nice native trees and wildflowers Take your own everything camping with drop toilets. No water available. So BYO Plenty of room in this inexpensive and popular campground. Fire grates provided, so load up with wood well before the turn off to the park Ants were a bit annoying when they got into the swags though."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Both sunrise and sunset are beautiful, get your camera ready for some great photos. There are some walks as well."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"You can see the Marbles from the highway but it is worthwhile spending the night in the camping area so you have plenty of time to explore and take lots of photos. The light on the rocks at sunset and sunrise is breathtaking. The camp ground is clean and well maintained, there is a nominal fee of $3.30 per person per night, camp fires are allowed."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"You can drive right up the the 2 most photographed ""marbles"" in this area, but there is much more to this 1,820 hectare site than just that. The rock formations are well worth spending some time walking around."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Conveniently located close to the highway, these rocks are quite awesome up close and provide great scope for photography. A good diagram provides information on how the rocks were formed."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),These interesting array of rocks are quite close to the highway so makes it easy to pull off the road and stop and explore for half an hour. They're quite stunning up close and make for some great photos.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"You can see some of the Devils Marbles from the highway, but turn off and there is so much more to exlplore. We didn't camp here, but will do another time. Very peaceful"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Basic amenities - but gorgeous stars and wonderful 'vibe'. I sat outside in the open on a moonless night just drinking in the Milky Way. It my new happy place.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),These rock formations are absolutely stunning and a must see for anyone travelling through. Overnight camping is available at $3.30 per head but you need to get there by mid afternoon otherwise you may struggle to get a spot. No dogs or generators permitted.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"any one who says you can 'do' karlu karlu in an hour doesn't get the the australian outback and is a tick and flick visitor! spend some time wandering the landscape, appreciate the sacred nature of the sight to the traditional owners"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Fantastic place to pull in with caravan for an overnight stop. Well maintained area, with fire places, toilets, and the view of the fabulous Marbles. The fees are now $ 3.50 per person, which is very reasonable. Rangers patrol the area, and the garbage bins are emptied regularly. This area fills very quickly during the day, so get in early, on this visit the park was very full, by mid afternoon. The area is National Park so heed all warnings regarding the collection of firewood, and pet dogs, on this visit the Ranger had to deal with both issues, and was met with quite a bit of aggro, but he was firm and warned all concerned. Top Location."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Incredible rock formations. Worth an hours' stay. Problem was flies but with one of those fly screens on your hat it was bearable. Got some fantastic photo's of these boulders. Better than Stonehenge.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),We stopped to have a look and liked it so much we camped overnight. The camping ground only provides a drop toilet so it's necessary to be self sufficient with everything else including water. For the grand cost of $6.60 we got to wake up with Karlu Karlu as our back drop.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"One of the top places to visit or camp at if you are heading to either Alice Springs or Darwin along the Stuart Highway. We have stayed a few times here during our travels. Camping fees are minimal with toilets available. There are no fees however to enter the park, see the views or climb the rocks. Ensure you visit on both sides of the road. Some eerie winds can form during the night and also some distant dingo howls. Be self-sufficient here as there is nothing else, although Wauchope roadhouse is only 8km away which do some big pub meals. The best photos are available in the evening with the rocks a fiery glowing red."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"might look like a bunch of rocks. or as a mate very unkindly said ""like someone took a d**p"" cos he was jealous he didnt get to go. YOU HAVE TO DO IT! it is worth the time you spend having a look around/getting a photo. they are natural wonders and defy the odds of gravity and all of nature's wrath. the light of the sun play these rocks to different colours and the same rocks never look alike at different times of the day."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"It's right on the highway, keep an eye out for the signs and pull over for a look, as you won't be disappointed. Only takes 15 minutes to jump out and take a few photos even if you are in a hurry!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Pretty flippen awesome. It is after all a bunch of round rocks stacked on one another but it is very cool. Sunrise and Sunset make them shine a deep red. There camping there is in a neat spot as well a very cheap!
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),devils marbles is a must see with any trip up the stuart highway and looking at it during sunset/sunrise is a perfect time the views are amazing
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Stayed overnight in a van with on board everything as there is no power or water to plug into, and the long drop toilets are not pleasant at all. That said the 'Marbles' are spectacular at both sunset and sunrise and the overnight parking/camping area is ideally located. You do need to get there early arvo for a good spot, which we did, then sat back and chilled out with everything we needed from our glam vans. Great chance to make a new friends also. Note that dingos are around the camping area at night so a good chance to try out the new torch for a game of 'spot the dingo'. Whether you stay the night or not, do not miss visiting the 'Marbles'."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We really enjoyed the side trip to see these, some really spectacular formations, reminded me of Stonehenge ... how did the marbles get to balance so perfectly ??"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"It was cold, raning a dreary the morning we visted so we didn't spend very long here, but it was worth getting a little wet for. These are an amazing geological formation, and really interesting to find out how they came about."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"This area was larger than I expected, you could wander around for hours if you wanted to. You can also camp overnight for a minimal charge, no power but there are toilets. Would be a great place for a picnic especially if you have children to play hide and seek, so don't just drive past"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),This stop is incredible. It would be a shame to drive past this natural wonder and not be taken by it's beauty. You can stop and camp here but there are no powered sites but there is a drop toilet. Awesome !!
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),These are some of the most impressive boulders i have ever seen. It is a great place to take the family as you can play hide and seek in amongst the boulders and it will take a lot to find you. It is a great place to take photos as the colors in the rocks change depending what time it is. It is also a great place to get your photo taken. You can climb between the boulders and also climb up on top of them. There are toilets but no food outlet close by. Take the family for a day and enjoy the area. .
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We arrived just as the sun rose; the site was very peaceful and as the early morning light lit up the marbles it created a very memorable sight. There is a short, well maintained walk around the marbles with information boards explaining their formation and discovery. There is also information on the well adapted local wildlife, for example frogs that survive without water for months on end. The marbles are well worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),I have been there twice this year (2013) and as a photographer it is great. This last time was with my family and everyone had a great time.It is ok to camp there but you will need all our own gear as it is not set up as a roadhouse or van park etc. The best time of day is at dawn or dusk however as a natural attraction any time is great. Walking around you will fill in a couple of hours easy. If you are not used to the climate make sure that you carry water.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Loved the Devils Marbles. Visited during the day, and could see how it would be nice to camp there overnight for $3.30 per person. But.... no water, no powered sites, ""long drop"" toilets would make it a suitable option only for some travellers - eg with self contained caravans, or photography buffs wanting to get dawn or dusk photos of the colour changes on the rocks."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"It was worth doing the drive from Darwin to Alice just to see these amazing rock formations. In the middle of nowhere with the most amazing colours and shapes. An upspoilt beauty, presumably because few people know about it."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),We arrives at the Devils Marbles very early in the morning. The light was just right for photographing the intense colours. There were no other visitors walking around and it was a very pleasing experience. I was impressed by the way the visitor parking and visiting areas were laid out to spread the impact across several areas rather than concentrate on one section. A truly beautiful area.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),This place is hard to get to from Tennant creek no tours now but try local shops near supermarket ask for nigel or another local one hour south agree a price onlynway now but do not miss it it is a wonderful place quite large and hot can also camp there a sacred site indigenous people will not go there
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"I always love to go to the Devils Marbles, you have to see them to believe...amazing is all I can say. Take the opportunity and go and have a look for yourself you will not regret it."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"If rock formations are your thing, or even if there not, most people should like this place. The formations of rocks sitting precariously on top of one another defies grafity at times. at the right time of day(sunset) this place comes in to its own."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),This wonder is located on the side of the Stuart Highway.There are so many of these smooth rounded rocks.Some of them are very tall.They are arranged in the most perfect way and catch the light on many angles.You can park and explore at your leisure.The marbles extend for a long way with lookouts along the way.There's a carpark available and the access is good.These old rocks are as good if not better than Stonehenge!! Nature's Wonder!!:)
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),drop in and have a look around at the many Rocks Precariously balancing on their edges. Make it look like you are holding it up ;)
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"these rocks are fascinating it makes you wonder if they are serpent eggs , the colours are amazing, it was a great place to stop the journey."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),This place is massive and great for taking good photo shots. One of the best attractions between Alice Springs and T.C. It's a must stop if you don't mind the heat.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"It is a huge area with many, many of these weirdly interesting rock formations. Some of them are split in half which has you wondering how and why! There is an eerie ambience. We were the only ones there at the time. It was very hot with lots of darn flies. I took a few videos. We could have investigated more but had to hit the road. Go there for sure."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"It was interesting for the hour we stayed. Probably could have been 20 minutes, but if you walk all the way around and stop and read all the info it takes about 1 hour. There is a camping area around the back for $3.30 per night per person. Honesty system. If you are passing by, stop for lunch and have a look, then keep going... not much else to see around there...."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"In between Tenant Creek and Alice Springs there is basically a lot of (quite scenic but monotonous) wilderness, and this. Even if it weren't the only feature of the area though, it would be well worth a stop. It's a dramatic collection of red boulders, where the surrounding softer rock has been eroded away to leave striking shapes and towers balanced one on top of another. It is quite spectacular visually and geologically, but also a great place for kids to clamber around and work off some energy. Be aware though, that if your kids do this, you may be accused of disrespecting a religious site: some snotty elderly (white) Australians said this to us, and then proceeded to climb all over it themselves, just not right to the top. Still, you can't be criticised for grabbing a few photos, so if you do nothing else, take a good look and snap a few frames."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"What a fascinating place, and FREE! It was wonderful to just roam around at leisure and feel the texture and breath in the history of this fabulous place"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"On the long desert drive from Tenant Creek to Alice Springs this is the only real place of interest. A remarkable collection of huge natural boulders beside the Stuart Highway, some seemingly balancing only on a small stone, and creating fantastic photo opportunities, this is a religious Aborigine site. Worth stopping on your long drive but no need to spend more than half a hour here to get a feel for the majesty of the place"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Spent a night here in July. Not long enough!! Could easily have spent another night/day here exploring and just soaking up the atmosphere.The whole conservation area is magical, and well worth a visit. The different colours as the sun rises and sets have to be seen to be believed. The camping area fills up pretty quickly in the cooler months, so best to get there before 3pm. We camped on the eastern side of the ground, lit our fire and watched the moon come up. Saw a dingo or two but they are quite timid and nothing to be concerned about. Make sure you have enough firewood on you as it is illegal to collect wood there. Payment for camping is an honesty system, and cost us $7.70 for our family of four. If you don't have time to camp though, the area is free to enter and explore. No showers, just toilets."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"As there isn't much more between Alice Springs and Tennant Creek than these giant boulders, it is easily the highlight in the region. That said, half a hour is enough to appreciate them and take a few shots. I would be a shame to miss it."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"As you pass right by on the highway out of Tennant Creek, you'd be silly to not stop and have a look at these great rock formations. Camping is available."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We visited the Devils Marbles on the 29th and 30th May 2012. We actually went there 3 times, once on the way to Wauchope Hotel and then came back for the Sunset and Sunrise the next day. The rocks, colour, light and feel are just superb. A definate ""must see"" on any ones list. What really did surprise us however was the great number of caravans parked at the rear of the site, but noone in sight. We seemed to have the whole area to ourselves and were able to take heaps of fantastic photos. For photographers.. it is magical. Maybe the very cold wind had something to do keeping people away."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"The information displayed was very informative, the whole area is unbelievable."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Stay a night at the Marbles, camp with only a mozzie net and see the stars, the sunset and the sun rise. Spend time feeling the rocks, taking photos, be astounded by their beauty and how they came to be. Don't be tempted to just fly through spend a night or two."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),If your camping watch out for the thorns!! We managed to put about 10 holes in each if our expensive air mats. The bad news is these holes are now also in our tent floor!!
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Definitely worth the drive, great Ozzy icon in the desert!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"The Devil's Marbles is a very special place. Walking around it I could feel the spirituality of the place. The Marbles themselves are stunning to look at, especially at dawn and dusk. There is a wonderful little campground at the back that is worth a night. So many stars and so much space. Unfortunately when I stayed there a large campervan/bus decided to also play films on a projector at night, using their generator for power. Less spiritual. The signs are clear but some people don't care. Shame."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),It feels so peaceful there and you feel so in touch with the earth. Nothing beats the bush!
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"A great place to visit on your way north or south. A good camping ground that is extremely popular in the southern winter months, get there early for a good park. The rocks at dawn and dusk are a fantastic sight."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Very unusual formation and some lovely photos can be taken around the Marbles or Serpents Eggs as the original inhabitants called them.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"Grea place to stop for a quick look around or an overnight camp - watching the sun set from atop one of the big boulders is a great way to end the day, but be warned it is over 1,000 km's and 10 hours drive from Darwin. I have no idea how it came be be included under Darwin attractions - it should be under Tennant Creek."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),The Devil's marbles are actually 1100 km from Darwin being a short distance south of Tennant Creek But they're well worth a visit. So good this was our second visit.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"A great spot to visit on your way to Alice. Just a bunch of massive round boulders but they asure are impressive, especially dawn or dusk as usual."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"we stayed till almost dark, got amazing photos as the rocks seemed to glow as the sun set on them. The carpark had alot of tourists camping there, so we felt completly safe, and was only about 14min drive back to the Wauchope Hotel. This is a must if you have the time, one of thew highluights of our oz trip. Take a torch, water and sunhat, and enjoy!"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),fancy having such an amazingly strange yet beautiful site out in the middle of no-where. Our 13 year old was mezmerized by the perching of these rocks on top of each other that seemed to be hanging by a thread. We didnt camp the night or anything but did note there is a small camping fee to pay in the honest box. A definate desert beauty!
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),We stopped at Devil's Marbles on July 30th. The weather was perfect not too hot and not too cool. We parked in the car park and explored. We were there with our 4 year old daughter and she enjoyed climbing on the rocks. We spent about an hour climbing on the rocks and taking photos. The scenery was amazing. We could have stayed longer but we were trying to avoid driving after dark and it was another hour an a half to Tennant Creek from the site. I highly recommend for people of all ages.
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We were travelling by road from Alice Springs to Darwin and made an overnight camping stop at Devil's Marbles. It is a long drive, so this was a welcome stopover for our three children, who greatly enjoyed the ability to climb the rocks and play hide and seek. A note of caution, in that the dreaming story posted on interpretative signage talked about spirits who lived in the rocks stealing aboriginal children, and the need to be cautious. We greatly enjoyed climbing on the many (unbelieveable) rocks, as well as walking around the immediate area. The sunset and sunrise with the rocks were magnificent. There are two carparks, one at the front as you pull off the main highway, designed for day visitors, and around the back for caravans and campers who are staying overnight (for a small National Park camping fee). A welcome break on the long road! Recommend planning an overnight camping stay."
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"I spent a night at devils marbles whilst on a tour of Australia. It was fantastic. These huge boulders make for a natural playground for the young at heart! Sturdy shoes are pretty essential as climbing these boulders can be tricky, as is often more of a scramble than a climb - well worth it though! I spent both sunset and sunrise marvelling at the marbles changing colours, it was a spectacular sight and definitely one not to be missed :)"
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"You'd be crazy to miss out on stopping in for a few hours at the Devils Marbles when doing a top end trip. They are a patch of rocks which have eroded into seemingly impossible round stacks and boulders. It's free and there are toilet/water facilities for a nice stop. It will take the keen explorer at least a couple of hours to poke you head around and while we didnt stop there the camp site (run by National Parks, only a few dollars a night) looked immaculate and well thought out. Be sure to pack the sunscreen as the heat can be a killer in the warmer months and either pack a fly net or take a dose of cement in the morning and harden up as the little buggers can be in swarm proportions. Sunrise and Sunset are definately the best times to be there so stay the night if you can."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,This waterhole has been closed the previous 6 years so it was fantastic to be here on its opening for season 2025. Definitely worth the drive.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The view from the upper falls was absolutely remarkable when my eyes were open it looked amazing but when they were closed I had some trouble seeing the edge of the waterfall. And then somehow I ended up in the croc trap because I thought there was a kfc chicken in there and I was hungry, if they didn’t want me in there they could have left it closed. I stubbed my toe on the rock coming out, hit a buffalo and damaged my bullbar. My front diff fell out caused from the corrugation on the road. Also I had to put down my tyre pressures because it was so bad and my tyre popped. Very disappointed. Under the water the rocks were very slippery and I fell over in the water. Don’t recommend coming here unless you are a barramundi looking for a feast upon other fish in the vicinity. NEVER AGAIN AM I COMING HERE. Signing off Karen"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Drive in was a 37km gravel road with some corrugation that improved after the first few km’s. We arrived at 9am before the crowds but met a lot of traffic when we left at midday. The walk up to the upper pools was an easy 650 metres but with a lot of steps. Well formed path with railings. The swim and the view was absolutely worth the drive. There is a campground and ammenities at Gunlom.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The sign posting wasnt very good and when we asked someone about the track out there they said it was awful.We drive out the 40kms to get there only to be greeted with a closed barrier over it.Track out there had corrigations but was good?????Can really comment on the falls but at the moment closed
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We were planning to visit Kakadu but when we were informed that two of its top attractions were closed, one for cultural reasons and the other due to road conditions, we thought we would give it the miss. The Kimberly region has the same, if not more and equally beautiful, on offer without being subject to these restrictions. Photos of the Kimberley."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The care takers are worse than a salty they totally kill the place and any fun to be had. No music, $15 bucks per head just for arriving not even advertised. You can't even talk after 8pm without the Sheila complaining and telling us she will call the police if she hears us laugh again. New care takers needed they are extremely rude and controlling."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"I really think people who are super entitled and having a whinge about the top pools being closed should really just jog on. For starters, who goes anywhere without doing research these days? Gunlom top pools have been closed for quite some time, so how can anyone with the internet not know that. Secondly, There is so much more that Kakadu has to offer, than a few, overdone, instagram shots. Sure it is a nice place, but If you have any type of intelligence, or cultural awareness, you will remember that Kakadu is ABORIGINAL land. It is a sacred place, and if the traditional owners want to close part of it, then respect that and stop complaining. Not only is Kakadu their home, it is their sacred land. In your own home, you have decisions about who visits and who doesn't. It's the same thing. Entitled people, unfortunately seem to think the world is theirs to access at all times. You forget, it is not an open, public spot and the only reason you have access to any of it, is because the Traditional owners have allowed you to come in. If you're only at Kakadu for the Gunlom top pools, then you're really missing out on all that Kakadu has to offer. Go do something else. Everyone has seen photos of the top pools to death. And we all know that's why you're there. Instagram shots. Go do something cultural for a change."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Visited here Sept 2019 when the top access was open. Its such a beautiful spot and amazing experience to swim in the pools. I was very sad to see that the access has been cut on my last visit July 2020 due to 'cultural' reasons even though the stairs have been there for many many years. I would recommend visitor not from the NT to boycott Kakadu as a result and punish the decision to close such a perfect spot. Its the same as Ulurru, that climb had also been closed a few months before. Coincidence????"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"My sister and I had a great day tour of Kakadu with Chizo from Never Never Safari Tours. He had lots of knowledge to share, particularly about the native flora and fauna. He found us some beautiful and safe places to swim! Lunch was also amazing (and well catered to vegetarians)! He was very flexible in what we wanted to do for the day and even took some bonus photos for us. Thanks Chizo!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Would of been nice to know that you can no longer access these pools above the water fall, its the only reason I did the long drive down a horrible dirt road, no signs on the way in saying they are closed just a small sign before the walking track! Not happy at all and a total waste of time."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Overnight stop here whilst traveling around Kakadu. Really good campsite with showers/toilets. Spread out sites with pit fires so you can enjoy some space from other campers. The falls itself is really nice, huge swimming area down the bottom, good for a splash throughout the day and a short walk from the campsite. There’s also a walk up the top to a lookout and plunge pools although this is currently/temporarily closed at the request of local indigenous population."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,All advices said Falls were open but alas after the long dirt road trip..plunge pool only. Still great place and had a nice swim
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Such a stunning area. Worth the 35km on gravel road. This makes it quite secluded. Unfortunately the track leading up to the pool at the top of the falls was closed. Next time...
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Incredible views and rock pools here now with a brilliant walking route making it easy for everyone to see it. There is a ranger led walk here on certain days, we opted not to do it as it would have meant us driving back to the hotel in the dark."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We visited in August and the stairs as mentioned in other reviews was not yet complete so we had to scramble over the rocks. Certainly strenous on a 38 degree day but definitely worth the effort once there. We were lucky that all the pools were open at the top and the infinity pool is simply amazing with the views over the campground etc below. We were disappointed however that we didn't take a picnic of some sort to enjoy whilst up there, so highly recommend you doing this if you go. But even if you don't go up to the top pools, the plunge pool at the bottom is amazing enough in it's own right. The top pools is probably more just one of those things you do to say you've done it. The road in was certainly challenging in places and we were lucky to go only a few days after it had been graded. Some people just drive too fast and you come around a corner to find them on your side of the road....so just be careful, but enjoy as it's a truly beautiful place."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Beautiful pools, refreshing swim. Worth the journey. Very few people there. Did not hike to top of falls but there is a path up"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"A cultural and educational visit. Steps have been erected going up the escarpment. When at the top there are 3 pools. 2 were closed due to renovation to the tracks leading to the pool. The infinity pool is a must see. Unfortunately we didn't get to go in it as it was closed. The ranger Adrian was a knowledgeable guy. Very much a people's person. The pool at the base of the escarpment is the resting place of the rainbow serpent, very sacred. An absolute must see, nature at its best. Toilets and camping at the bottom."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We did a day trip with Cooinda Lodge and Glenn our guide was friendly, caring and a fountain of knowledge. Fortunately the road had just been graded after being closed so our 37km dirt road drive in was well worth it. The bottom pool was beautiful. The waterfall wasn't flowing too much but it was the dry season.....we had two choices of getting to the top to a selection of wonderful swimming holes....climbing up through the rocks or the using the new staircase (far easier). Felt like we were in an infinity pool at the top and the view was stunning. Loved our swim. Had a picnic lunch provided and sat under the trees on the camping ground level. Bathrooms were very clean. It would be great to camp here and stay for longer. Definitely worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The road in is really poor and once we got there, it was very difficult to find a trickle of water apparently due to the past 2 wet seasons. check the road and if the falls are running before visiting. The rock pool at the bottom had a few swimming in it. The climb to the top is difficult and not worth the effort unless the falls have water."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This place is amazing and they were installing better railed walkways to the top when we were there, Lovely swimming at the bottom and top"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Falls are stunning. Walk was straight up but fairly easy. Heaps of room at the camping ground. Showers aren’t fantastic but the area is stunning.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"A natural infinity pool with views over Kakadu, a stunning plunge pool at the bottom of the falls. It is breathtaking sitting atop a waterfall with the most amazing backdrop there is a reason it’s on sooo many brochures. The walk to the top would now be staired as it was almost finished when we went, there is still a bit of an effort over rocks to get there once over the top but so worth it. Great facilities at the bottom, picnic area and toilets etc, well worth the incredibly bumpy 4wd trip in. Just go here."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Wife and were really looking forward to this adventure. Turned off the Hwy to immediately hit the worst road ever. We have a 4wd but we respect our truck and it is our life line. Spoke to a passing motorist in a 4wd who turned back as the road got worst. We turned around. I would suggest that the information centres do regular check up on the roads and fix their maps as they show several kilometres of bitumen then corroded road for 30 klms. Not all corrogation as you turn off Hwy. Very disappointing.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Camped up at Gunlom campgrounds in a lovely shady spot before a short walk to the bottom pool for a swim and shower under trickling Falls. This is such a beautiful place. Then climbed to the top pool, had it to myself to enjoy the tranquility in the infinity pool and the crystal clear water under the Falls. Aaaaahhh the serenity!!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The waterhole is beautiful and the water was cold which was appreciated after a hot day of travelling. Definitely worth visiting
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,After a steep climb this rock pool is like a little bit of magic oasis. My kids 4 and 6 loved the rock climb and we loved the view from the top. Well worth a visit.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"I was most looking forward to visiting Gunlom falls and the plunge pool probably mores than anything else while we were going to be in Kakadu. We set out early from our hotel at Cooinda Lodge (around 8:45am) and arrived at the parking area of the falls by 10:15am. You do NOT need a 4WD - AWD vehicle is fine. More on that later. This turned out to be perfect, because as we were driving in on the dirt road there was a mass exodus of camper vans. They had had their sunrise and morning swim and everyone was vacating when we arrived at 10:15. Most people go straight to the base of the falls, but we made it straight for the top. It took maybe 20 minutes to get to the top. It was actually quite easy. They have built stairs and amazing paths so in a few months those will be finished and it even easier to get to the top of the falls. Only a little bit of rock scrambling when we were there. We had the plunge pool to ourselves because a family thought it was too cool to swim and they went to the upper pools. We easily swam for about 50 minutes with hardly anyone else there. Then it started getting busy (a lot of people came without swimmers) but they just looked at the place from the side of the water. We went to the upper pools at this time and surprise - no one there! We plopped down for a nice swim and then had lunch. It was so wonderful. Now, let's talk about the drive in. We were there on June 1, and the road had been recently grated and we thought it was very manageable for our all wheel drive subaru. The road was wide at some points, skinny at others, and whenever there was a rock or big divit in the road they had a sign warning you. There was some bumpy washboard effect on the road - but I get that all the time in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia, USA. the roads here were better. What really damages the road are the locals who speed like crazy down the road. You get the sense they had these ridiculous trucks with snorkels and they were just showing off trying to use their off road vehicles for a change. Please do yourself a favor, and others, and slow down when someone passes in the opposite direction. It's very unsafe when the locals would fly by, kick up dust, and then you could not see at all for a few seconds. Just go slow, and you'll do fine on this road. I did notice that they removed the signs on the road which said 4WD recommended, as an all wheel drive vehicle (all wheel drive means all 4 wheels are engaged) can navigate it just fine. We even saw some 2WD cars make the journey - though I'm not sure I would have felt comfortable due to the crazy locals who speed and tear up the road."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The new constructed way with stairs to the pools make it easier to reach the upper pools. If you are fit it is possible to reach the pools in 20 min. But don't miss the view at the lake below.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"A beautiful view and a swim in crystal clear water in (sometimes) your own infiniti pool. The walk up to the lookout and down to the pools is a bit challenging but worth the effort. By now (middle of June) I believe the path up should be all steps. Go with a guide for the first part of the walk as they have some great knowledge of the area including where a particular scene from ""Crocodile Dundee"" was filmed."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,My family and I stayed at the National Park for a night and it was an amazing experience! Incredibly cheap and definitely worth it! It was a bumpy ride to get to the park and it takes about 40 minutes to get back to the main highway. It’s an easy walk for around ten minutes but then starts to get stepper and rockier. It’s a set path except for the end which you had to climb rocks but they are putting in place stairs. The rock pools were just amazing! Can’t describe how great they were and the sublime view that came with it. Once in a lifetime opportunity!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"A natural beauty in Kakadu. Pool after pool a d a wonderful infinity pool to enjoy. The climb up is tough but worth the effort. Part of the walk is an easy track, but the last part requires scrambling over rocks and is a decent climb. I’d highly recommend as this was my favourite of all the waterholes in Kakadu!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"If you think the drive in is already troublesome, wait till you have to do the climb up to the top. The pool at the top is however worth the arduous climb up. The initial part is easy with some stairs and gravel but it gets a little tricky when you get nearer the top. You'll need to negotiate rocks and narrow paths which can be quite a challenge for young children or people with some disabilities. To access the pools at the top, you would need to climb down another series of rocks but once you're there all the effort seemed worthwhile. You'll need about 30 minutes if you're averagely fit There are quite a number of small pools separated by rock bars so there is always one that you can make your own. Be forewarned that some can be quite deep and the rocks beneath are slippery and have crevices where one can get your ankle badly twisted if you're not careful. So if you're not a good swimmer, I suggest staying close to the edge. There is another pool at ground level but you'll be missing out completely. A couple we met at the top even told us that they spotted a croc while they were there. The views are astonishing and breathtaking. This is definitely the best of the lot and well worth the drive and climb. There are toilets and showers at the base next to the car park. Kakadu is not without Gunlom."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,We climbed to the top of the falls and swam in the waterhole below the falls. The track up was well marked and mostly pathed with more walkways being built. The view from the top was spectacular and the infinity pool...incredible.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"UNREAL! 10/10! A serious MUST DO! A highlight on our trip and one for yours, wont be disappointed 🙌"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The infinity pool of the top of Gunlom was fantastic. Amazing views and we were lucky enough to be the only ones there.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Last stop for our day as the falls are located a long way in off the beaten track. Road in was fairly well corrugated and 4wd a must. The good thing along the way in was seeing some of the locals from wild donkeys,Bush cattle and dingoes made the slow kilometres tick away. At the falls there is an awesome campground with warm showers and toilet facilities. There is also a day use area which was fairly busy in the mid afternoon. The walk up to the top pools is clearly marked and in sections quit steep.They are currently installing stairs over these steeper section which will make accessibility easier. But..when at the top sweeping views to the surrounding countryside await. The falls were not raging at this time of year but held plenty of water for a cool swim. At the bottom plunge pool the access is far easier for anybody and it to is worth a swim."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Found down the southern end of Kakadu is the Gumlon Waterfalls and creek. Part of this scenery appeared in the movie Crocodile Dundee and it is a truly great swimming hole and tourist spot. There are magnificent views plus other swimming spots for those who hike to the top. The track is steep in places but currently being improved with walkways and metal bridges to make it more accessible to walk to the top. Scenery from the top is truly magnificent and the park area caters for campers and picnickers. There is about 30 kms of dirt road to get there after leaving the bitumen.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,There is a campsite close to the falls. It has good facilities. Hot showers and flushing toilets. Generator area away from non generator area. Fire pits. Nice view. Short walk to the plunge pool at the base of the garden falls. Campsite was expensive but it does have good facilities. The walk to the top of the falls is really worth it. There are a few pools to swim in at the top. The water is lovely. If you camp you can eat up there early before any tours arrive. It’s perfect when you have it to yourself or with a couple of people.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Lucky to be able to enjoy this beautiful waterfall and pools. Worth the drive and climb to the upper pools. A new path is being built which will make it even easier. We were advised to use the upper pools as no chance of crocodiles! Don't even think of doing the drive without 4WD....
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We have a 3 and 1/2 year old and was worried about doing the lookout walk but she was totally fine, took us about 20min. Very steep in some parts just take your time. The walk is amazing and worth it. Take plenty of water and some snacks so you can relax whilst up there. The pools up the top are stunning!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Gunlom has panoramic view of country from standing inside one of the infinity cascading rock pools at the top of the falls. The plunge pool below has a fair bit of shallow beach area. Best camp site ever. Clean toilet and shower faculties. We were parked and camped where we could view the top part of the falls and hearing the sound of many waters! It took our camping experience to a whole new level. This should on anyone's A list for NT.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We visited Gunlom for a swim during our visit to Kakadu. Although part of the trip is over 30km of dirt road,there were plenty of cars & people there. The walk up to the pool is steep, rugged & scary. Once you make the effort the reward is remarkable!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Do not miss this place - absolutely one of the most superb places I've ever been to. Dont be put off by the steep walk - they've graded the track with a machine so its a pretty smooth path for most of the way but there is a steep rocky bit toward the end - wear stable shoes.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom is off the main highway about 39km on an unsealed road; however, it was perfectly fine to drive with a Rav4. I even saw a Toyota Camry make the trip - the visitors center will tell you that you have to have a 4x4, but that's generally not required. However, let me also state that the road was just graded a few days before I went and I would recommend checking on the status/condition before going. Hike up is not bad and waterfall pools are amazing. I wish that I had camped out at Gunlom, but had to get back to Jabiru so just missed sunset. Make time to see this place!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This is my favorite spot in NT you do walking climbing swimming offroading and mostly you will enjoy the magical nature! Dont miss this place when your in NT! I highly recommend this place, go there and enjoy your time with family and friends, as they have camping area and other turist facility!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Kakadu is full of beautiful nature spots, Gunlom is definitely a highlight. Beautiful waterfall and pool at the bottom of the cliff and gorgeous infinity pools at the top. It is a short but steep walk up to the top, locals do it in flip flops but I recommend proper shoes, some parts of the climb are slippery. The road to gunlom is not recommended for 2 wheel drive or caravans. The area has good camping facilities. It is very busy, it is not a hidden treasure in the NT, and is heavily touristed in the dry season."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"If you are heading to Kakadu, Gunlom Falls is a must do. We also recommend 100% taking a 4x4. There are 2wd tracks aswell but it really limits what you can see especially when paying to enter the park you want to maximise your stay. A guide told us we couls take our van to Gunlom Falls as its 2wd accessible but it was the most awful horrible drive and causes suspension damage so definitely go 4x4. However once we made it to the falls it was so magical. It's a very steep hike up so be prepared. Take water and sturdy shoes and a hat. The reward is an infinity pool overlooking the Kakadu national park and it's very beautiful."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Leaving the motel at five in the morning, bleary-eyed and yawning, we were oddly thrilled to be awake so early. We were on our way to Gunlom falls, and it was to be my first visit. 18 years in the NT, and I'd never been to one of the most iconic locations in my backyard. I was determined for this trip to be a perfect final memory of the NT before I moved south for university. Pulling up in the quiet car park at the foot of the cliff, not another person was in sight. The falls had only just been opened to the public again following the wet season, and we had anticipated a lot more foot traffic on our hike to the still creek. Instead, we were accompanied by the early morning songs of birds and the soft buzzing of flies and mosquitoes. Sweat dripped into our eyes as we climbed the uneven path, our legs aching and lungs burning. 30 minutes passed, and our limbs filled with the heavy weight of exhaustion. Finally, the ground levelled and dipped, leading down to the crystal clear waters of Gunlom. We piled our backpacks onto the flattest and shadiest rock we could find, stripped away from our swimmers, and jumped into the freezing water. We let the cold water wash over our heat flushed skin. We stayed in the water for hours, with no one else around until we were leaving. It was like a hidden paradise."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Like so much of the NT, Gunlom falls is not easy to get to without a 4WD. But the effort it takes to get there makes it all the better. There is a large pool at the bottom of the waterfall, although we were warned by a local guide that there is a freshwater croc that has made that pool it's home. Freshies are (supposedly) harmless, but I wouldn't like to see one when I'm swimming. We were also warned that every year they set traps for salties and usually have to relocate 1 or 2 every year from close to the waterfall. That said, there were plenty people (myself included) that took a dip in the bottom pool to cool off. The climb to the top of the waterfall is HARD. It is very steep, with no clearly marked path at times. You'll need a decent level of fitness and good shoes to do this climb. Once you get to the top there are a series of connected pools that lead to the top of the waterfall. Absolutely spectacular. Swimming in the pools at the top made the climb totally worth it. Highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,My vocabulary runs out of superlatives to describe this place. Just go and experience it yourself. You won’t be disappointed.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"As with anywhere in Kakadu, you must travel, often along long and dusty corrugated roads, to get to the real gems of this place. Gunlom is one of them. But well worth it. And the hike up to the rock holes up the top of the waterfall are well worth the effort as well. The view is amazing and the infinity pool is something truly special. If you don't want to hike it up the hill there is a plunge pool at the bottom of the waterfall with a lovely view of the falls which you can swim in. The campground is large and amenities block clean and well looked after. A small station for washing up."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This is a beautiful spot. The only draw back is that it is around 30kms of extremely corrugated road. The maps say you can take 2 wheel drives in which you can, but I wouldn't expect to come out unscathed. It is really a 4 wheel drive track. The water fall and plunge pool at the bottom are great. It is however worth the walk to the top to have a dip in the cascading pools at the top. It is a steep walk but worth it zdx make sure you take water."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,It is a fairly rough road in but all 4wds are fine and probably most 2wds if they take it easy. A large lagoon at the bottom but the highlight are the rock pools at the top. It is a steep rock hopping climb to the top but our 9yo girl managed it fine. An average level of fitness and mobility is needed. You are then rewarded by some great views and a series of rock pools one of which has the look of an infinity edge. Must see.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Even though we visited during end of the dry season and the waterfall was only a trickle, this is still an amazing place. There is a campsite and parking right next to the bottom of the falls with a large pool that is safe to swim in and it is lovely. A steep, rocky and hot climb of about 1km takes you straight up to the top of the falls where there are a series of pools you can swim in that give you astonishing views across the landscape. Probably the best natural infinity pool you will see anywhere. A must see location if you can."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Great place to spend the say, get there early, pick your spot and spend the day on the beach under the trees. You can also take a hike up to the top and enjoy the views. Not for the light hearted. Its rocky and hot. So do the climb earlier in the day."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This place is incredible and so worth the hike up the hill. It is a bucket list place you will never forget. Suggest you don't do what I did and hime up at 1.30pm. It is incredibly hot to climb a rock goat track. If you like rock scrabbling like I do, its only a 15-20 mins hike. Most take a solid 30mins. Take water and wear good shoes. You could easily pack a lunch, walk up in the morning, down in the afternoon. Its a lovely place to relax."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Was recommended by friends to visit. Was not disappointed. The road in was about 35km of corrugated roads which was rough but doable in a standard car. And hey you're in the territory so it's part of the adventure. While near the later half of the dry season there are still beautiful ponds to swim in and magnificent views.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Driving from Cooinda, Kakadu, down to Katherine we wanted to see the much raved about Gunlom falls and the Infinity pools and it didn't disappoint. Firstly the drive in is a good 20 to 40 minutes over corrugated roads, it pays to let a bit of air out of the tires (10psi is just enough if you don't have your own compressor) to make it more bearable though you won't be able to air back up until Pine Creek some 40mins down the highway or Cooinda lodge some 1hr 20 toward the north. We decided to trek to the top first which would be quite challenging for some but taking your time most people could do it. You do have to climb over rocks on the walk so be aware of that and even though i didn't id recommend most people wear shoes to make it easier. Being late in the season the water wasn't flowing so much and the water was a bit green from algae but it was amazing to lay in and take in the views. Saying this we did walk back down and swim in the water hole at the bottom which is right near the carpark and was absolutely stunning with a nice sandy bottom ...and the water was cleaner too. I would recommend anyone with health issues or troubles walking just to enjoy the water hole down the bottom..its just as pretty."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The pools at Gunlom are outstanding, a little busier than at Majuk but we still had the pools to ourselves for most of the time. There are croc warning sings but we swam in dry season, made sure the waters were clear and swam where we could see other people had swam. Lovely walk up to the pools although a little steep in places but take your time and it’s fine."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Really worth the 4WD trek out there; but would definitely recommend a 4WD, particularly at the end of the dry season when the road is quite bad. The walk to the top isn’t long, but is quite steep, although I wouldn’t say too challenging. Infinity pool gets super busy, so I’d recommend going early if you want to take pictures. We didn’t swim in the bottom pool because we ran out time; but there was a freshy in the bottom pool on the particular day we were there. So I would just say to be careful around the bottom pool."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Let's start with the road in. 35 kms of the worst corrugations in Australia. And what do the entry signs say? 40kmh speed limit and 4wd recommended. Yet people rocket along at 80kmh, no one drops their tyre pressures and each of these people make the road worse for the next visitor. Get some common sense please and realise this road demands a crawl and will take an hour or more. We saw a wrecked Nissan Xtrail on the way in and a wrecked Hilux on the way out - it's that dangerous. Then there is the campground. Zero privacy and some of the worst behaviour anywhere. Multiple groups laying music loudly. Fires everywhere despite no mozzies and 30 degree plus temperatures. People illegally scouting nearby wetlands for kindling. Drones being flown. And people arriving at midnight with 4wd spotlights on. Seriously Australia, what has happened to campground etiquette? Expect the worst here, but the showers and toilets are good. Even the campground manager was resigned to expecting bad behaviour when we asked him if he could ask people to turn down their music. The falls themselves are amazing, but go up at the end lf the day to avoid the masses and people strugfling up the slippery, dusty track in thongs and sandals. This really is the place to see tourists behaving their worst. So disappointing."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom Falls is not one of the easiest places to access but it is well worth the effort. The road in is 36 km of dirt, quite corrugated in places and the 1km climb up is very steep. On reaching the top you then have to negotiate a steep descent into the pools. However, once you arrive it’s well worth it. The pools are clear and although quite cool, once you get in you don’t want to get out."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"It's our favourite spot, always beautiful. About 20-30 minute walk to the top, there are rock pools on the top, the water just beautiful. Bring some snack and spend the arvo up there. Bottom pool is nice as well, it's a bit cold in dry season but once you jump in, the water just beautiful. Highly recommend this place."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Agree...leave your caravan behind...the road has DEEP corrugations that shake every screw ,every joint and even sets your teeth on edge.Then there is the dust! Its 40kms but can take an hour! Enough of the road...the campsite is fantastic...great toilet block and even recycling for bottles! The Falls are beautiful, the walk up rough and rocky so need good shoes. The pools at the top are stunning. Check out the lookouts, down to the plunge pool! Swimming safe top pools and bottom plunge pool. Nice shady picnic spots top and bottom. Toilet block at car park, for day trippers too."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"For a quick walk up it is 15-20 min up. Not too bad. Steep, so if bad knees or poor shape do skip. Worth a good view if you are able. Can jump in or just put your feet in."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Don’t believe google maps. This road only takes maximum 45 minutes each way. It is so beautiful at the top infinity pool. A must see in Kakadu. Take a picnic in the green grass car park and head up the hill with snacks and water. We hiked up with an 8 year old. Steep but fun!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,This was on my bucket list and so glad I have ticked it off. Just gorgeous. A collection of pools with beautiful views over Kakadu. Try to go nice and early in the morning before the crowds get there. Just magic.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Easily accessible area, a magical combination of waterfalls and serene plunge pool with great picnic area amongst shady trees. Fantastic for a day picnic here with plenty to do. Come to Gunlom means you must make this fairly steep 2km return hike to the top of a series of small waterfals and rockholesl for that spectacular views surround and below. Brave into the Infinity Pool to experience that 'up in the sky' feeling swimming at the edge of the falls up in the escarpment. Just don't forget your camera, swimmers and good walking shoe. Truly spectacular. Not to be missed."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,This is the place to come. A pretty tough scramble of 40 minutes up a hillside takes you to a croc-free natural infinity pool with stunning views. Come here but avoid the hottest parts of the day!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We visited in the early dry season. Two wheel drive accessible but four wheel drive preferable to reach this stunning spot in the Kakadu National Park. Whilst we didn’t camp this would make a lovely spot for camping as there are good facilities including natural swimming pools. The plunge pool at the bottom of the falls is accessible for all. Would highly recommend making the climb to the top of the falls where there’s a lookout over the vast beauty that is the Kakadu, and some beautiful pools to swim in and cool off once you get there. You would need good mobility and fitness to make it up as it’s a steep climb. The water levels in the top pools had dropped a little but with higher levels these pools form a natural infinity pool looking out over the unspoilt Kakadu. Would definitely recommend."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The drive took us about 45-50 minutes in a 2wd from the turn off down the dirt track. The road Is corrugated and a little rough in a few patches but it is not too rough. Once there there are toilets and a large grassed area. The walk to the top of the falls is steep but not overly long. I think it would be a harder walk down for some as some of the steps are large. The pools at the top are amazing. The rocks in them were a little slippery so some care is needed. The pools were over head height in places but if you are not confident in the water there are plenty of areas where you were able to stand. There was a Golden tree python 🐍 on the rocks whilst we were there and someone else had seen a snake on the path near the pool. There is a pool at the bottom which has a sandy beach that gradually get deeper. The visibility is very good in the shallows so is a good spot for younger swimmers.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Google got us worried and we almost didn’t visit when it was suggested a trip to Gunlom would take us 3 hours! Luckily, the rangers told us it’s 3 hours return. We drove in a 2WD to Gunlom from Cooinda lodge, leaving early so we could avoid the peak of the heat. Visiting at the end of May, the track was open to 2WD. The first hour of the drive is the highway so no issue. Once you reach the turnoff the unsealed road begins. We were very lucky as yesterday when we visited, the road was being ‘compressed’ and it made it a lot easier to drive. We took it slow on the way there so it took around 45-50 minutes. A 4WD could do it in 30 minutes. Once there, there is ample parking, toilets, a grassed shaded picnic area and tables. The main swimming area at the bottom of the falls is ideal for kids with a sandy bank, and areas that are shallow. Only 200m from the carpark, it’s very easy to access for everyone. Swimming all the way to the base of the fall the water gets deep. It’s a beautiful, postcard place to swim in Kakadu. If you can’t make it to the top, don’t feel too disappointed, the bottom is still wonderful. The infinity pools at the top of the falls are amazing and if you up for it, worth the hike. We had our 10 month old baby with us and my husband carried her in a MacPac to the top. He is fit and a confident walker so managed with no problem. The walk up has a few ‘bums and hands moments’ for some but if you take it slow you’ll be fine. I’m not overly confident, and managed without any issues. People did the climb in thongs when we were there and we saw other babies in carriers and children ranging in age from 6 to 12 who all managed. (I don’t think carrying a baby up would be possible if they couldn’t walk so a carrier of some kind seemed like a must). As a guide, allow 30 minutes to walk up. Taking drinks and food is a great idea so you can enjoy your swim and not feel rushed to make the trip back down. At the steepest parts of the walk, closest to the pools, there are rails and at other points trees or rocks you can grab to help give you some support. If you have visited Ubir and found that difficult, then the walk/climb is perhaps not for you. The infinity pools are beautiful to swim in and we are very glad we visited. Swimming at Kakadu was on our bucket list of experiences and without doubt a highlight of our trip up North. A couple of tips for those with small kids - the rocks are slippery, the water is deep in parts and the water is naturally quite cold. Taking float toys and float safety rings/vests makes it a lot easier for babies/toddlers! Unless you can confidently tread water and get in and out of the water holding them, on slippery rocks then it’s worth lugging few extra things up. There are some parts that small children can stand up in if helped there. The walk up is quite sunny but once at the top there are shaded parts to sit & swim."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,I have been wanting to do this place for a while. A little rough on the 2 wheel drive car but it made it. The walk up is steep but worth the hard slog. Cool down with a nice swim. So worth the trip.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The place is not easy to reach. You must drive around 35 Km on a unsealed road to arrive there. Close to the car park there is a lagoon where you can swim and the view of the waterfall is amazing. There is a picnic area with toilets and BBQs. For me the best area of this place is the upper pools. It takes about 30 min to get there and the trail is quite steep. Be sure to wear appropriate footwear. But don't discourage about that. We made the trail with children without problems. We saw also aged person and even a couple with a baby. The view pays the effort. The pools are awesome and the view from the top of the waterfall is espectacular. I definitely recommend it.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"After a moderate walk up a steep path beside the falls, you arrive an infinity-like pool on the edge of the main drop of the falls, overlooking the plains of this beautiful country"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The climb to the top is very steep and over lots of rocks but worth every bead of sweat as the views are magnificent. The pools and fall at the top are a wonderful reward for the climb up. I have been in nicer pools, clearer and deeper but the setting is magic. Not to be missed. Lovely picnic area with toilets and BBQs at the bottom. Unfortunately the pool at the bottom had a croc sighting so it was closed. That's the territory."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The hike to the top of the gorge to get to the pools is quite difficult and there are many many flies which pester you constantly. But it is all worth it when you get to the top. There are amazing pools there, which give 'infinity pools' views when you in them. We spent over 2 hours there as it was so spectacular. Also it was very quiet (only a few people bother to go up) so you can have the pools to yourself if you are lucky. A tip: Only when you are inside the pools do the flies stop bothering you! One of the most memorable sights of my trip to the park and well worth the effort."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Make sure you take a comfy car that can handle the extremely rough drive over dirt road. The climb to the top of the water fall is hard especially in hot temps but once you are up there it is a great view and amazing to see the natural infinity pools. Was as nice as Edith to swim in but nice to see.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This would have to be one of my favourite places in Kakadu. Stunning, beautiful cascading swimming holes. Very steep 900m or so climb to the top so those without a reasonable level of fitness may struggle to get up there. The water was clear and warm and the view from the lower pool was just incredible. There are beautiful picnic grounds and very modern amenities block as well. Highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Travelled the 37km of rough corrugated road. Did it in a 2wd (not for the faint hearted). Once at Gunlom we parked and started to 1km steep and rocky bush climb to the lookout and top plunge pools. Lovely swim on such a hot day. For a terrible drive the view made up for it.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The plunge pool was great, I didn't walk to the top but hubby said it was really nice but pretty steep. If you intend to camp and want to use a generator you need to turn it off by about 6pm & be prepared for near cold showers. Road in was very dusty but otherwise not too bad."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Gunlom is well worth the bumpy 37 km trip of corrugated road in to an oasis. We swam in the infinity pools at the top of the climb as well as the waterhole at the bottom. It is truly spectacular. I do recommend decent footwear on the climb up s a few wearing thongs were struggling on the steep but doable climb!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Loved Gunlom. It is about 40km off the main road. The road is corrugated but not too bad. The hike to the top is steep & if going a little later in the morning can get quite hot as you are in the sun, but once you get to the top you can swim in one or all of the many pools there. It is a postcard view from the top so make sure you have your camera. There is a pool down the bottom as well to cool off once you climb back down. There is a lovely grassed area with trees & BBQ's to enjoy some lunch. Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Probably because it's down a 4WD track there were not many people at the site when we visited. At the end of the dry season the waterfall was just a trickle but looking at the pictures of it in full flow, it must be quite spectacular then. Nice lagoon for a swim on a hot day."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Crocodiles are a hazard in Kakadu and you have to be careful where you swim. At Gunlom, there are a number of small pools at the top of the falls which form a natural 'infinity pool'. No chance of a croc up here! At the bottom there is a shaded grassy area perfect for a picnic or relaxing on a hot day. Be prepared, the path up to the top rises some 80 metres or so and on a hot day it can be exhausting. The road to Gunlom is unsealed so can be a trial for drivers nit used to corrugated roads - drive at a stead 40km to reduce the shaking."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Beautiful swimming plunge pool, steep walk to the top, but is a MUST DO! Amazing views, great swimming pools and a couple of small water falls."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"I do not think it was worth the long drive from Cooinda, but mostly because when they say that the climb is 1 hour steep and strenuous, you should take it very serious. We climbed to what I thought was the top and then there was a really steep down climb, that made me give up! At least the view was beautiful and the lake under the waterfall beautiful."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Thankyou to the Bininj/Mungguy people for letting us view this park. Gunlom is a bit of a drive. If you are in the planning phase and want to do a day trip look to stay at Cooinda. It is 50km closer than Jabiru. The last 35km into Gunlom is dirt with lots of corrugations. We drove in with a small Hyundai, it is safe but can take a bit of time as you need to look at ground clearance for small rocks and smaller wheels dont soak up the bumps so well. Gunlom is so pretty. Lots of greenery while we were there in contrast with the red dust and dark rocks. We started with the climb up to the pools. Its not too steep or difficult. Lots of families going up. When you get to the top and look to drop down to the pools, look to the right. There is a path that leads up to the lake at the top. I am not sure if that lake is croc free, but we didnt risk a swim there. The pools are safe, about 2m deepest with lots of shallow bits to sit. Chilly to get in but you soon get used to it .And the views are stunning, especially after the walk up. Back down at the bottom we popped over to the small lake. Fantastic setting with clear water, small fish, white sandy beach and shady trees. We got a bit pressed for time and had to be in Darwin that night. Just for anyone interested we left Jabiru early, about 7.30 and got down to Gunlom, then drove down to Pine creek and up to Darwin on the Stuart highway, getting in about 6pm with a few stops for coffee and petrol. Big day but not too hard."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Very very nice place to stop. Unfortunately, you have to drive on a gravel road (but it was fine in Winter, with no rain/mud to degrade the experience). Recommended even with a family group."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The road Into Gunlom is 37 km of bone jarring corrugations with a lot of river and floodway crossings which would mean this site would be closed in the wet season. 4WD is the perfect vehicle for this trip, but plenty of cars get through, all be it, very slowly. Once you get there, there is a gorgeous green, watered camp site with toilet facilities. The pool at the base of the falls is gorgeous with a beach area which is wheelchair accessible and great for kids and those with limited mobility. If your more energetic, the climb to the top of the falls is worth the effort. This is where the Infinity pools are situated. It is lovely, but go early, because it gets busy, and the pools are not big. Be a little adventurous and scramble a little higher than the rest of the hoards, and you will be rewarded with your own private swimming hole!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Swimming in the elevated pool looking out over the countryside, an amazing experience. Unlike the young ones I didn't swim too close to the edge. After the climb up you definitely needed to cool off. Swimming in the lower pool was also fun except for the small fish which were biting our legs. We visited late at night and saw freshwater crocodiles. There was a ranger giving a slide presentation that evening which was very informative and interesting. Thankful that the camp area had hot showers and flushing toilets,"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Great little swimming hole but take the walking track to the top of the falls for more swimming and a great view of Kakadu
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"FANTASTIC!! When you get there you are greeted with a fantastic almost circular gorge, waterfall and pristine crystal clear water. A perfect place for a swim. Bring a noodle or a float of some kind because it is just great to be able to float and relax. A walk to the top of the falls is steep but the view is spectacular."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"There are two options, there is a flat walk to the plunge pool at the bottom or a steep walk to the top infinity pools. I suggest the steep walk, it is hard but definitely worth it! the views are amazing and breathtaking. A camera and comfortable shoes are a must as the track is rocky and sandy. One of my favourite places in Kakadu."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The steep sandy and rocky walk was a bit challenging at times however the reward of the multilevel Falls and views was worth it and very refreshing Camping grounds for lunch but a very bumpy drive in
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The road to the creek is an easy one but not very short. There are tw options. You can take a dive in the pool at the bottom of the falls. This is allready great. Or you can climb up towarfs the upper pools. This is not an easy climb and i would not advise it if you are afraid of heights. Take wayer with you, the right shoes for climbingbup the rocks and your bathing gear. It s difficult but worth it if you can reach the top."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We did this very steep, rocky climb to discover an amazing group of pools with spectacular views. The rocks are dusty and slippery so be aware with little kids but the rock climbing was great and the kids loved it. Take snacks, water and a blow up ring for the kids to float. Once you're back to the bottom enjoy a picnic (that you packed earlier :) with some nice cold water."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,short but steep walk to a lookout and the most amazing infinity pools. there is also a shaded pool at the bottom and lovely grassy shady picnic area. it is very busy around lunch time but otherwise not too packed. it is a long corrugated dirt road in there also
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Lovely spot off the beaten track but well worth the effort. Beautiful sandy area perfect for a dip on a hot day!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We drove in our 28ft caravan after two recommendations from Katherine information and bowali information centre. 40km of dirt Rd mostly rough and corrugated. Horrible drive with the van. I'd never recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a true off road setup. Thankfully the plunge pool and waterfall were spectacular. Our kids loved it. We explored the waterway above the falls as far in as we could. The campgrounds have hot showers, toilets, rubbish bins and fire pits. A ranger will come by to collect payment. For a family it was $38 per night. The climb up to the top of the falls was incredibly steep and slippery in places. Wear shoes with good grip."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Gunlom is easy to get to. The campsite is large with plenty of room. Campsites have fire places. Large toilet and shower block. Grassed day area and separate toilet block. Ranger talks are interesting. Climb to the top is easy enough and you can spend a whole day up there if you wish. The Infinity pool is amazing. We don't swim in the pool at the bottom due to croc trap. We have been here many times and enjoy it every time. A must on your Kakadu itinerary.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The climb can be a bit slippery on the rocky path. We saw twisted ankles and sore knees. The view from the top is wonderful over the edge of the pools. Great safe swimming opportunities in such an iconic place. Bring your swimmers and camera.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,One of my favourite places in kakadu. A short steep but fun walk to the top of the falls. Several pools to swim in on top all really nice. There was a shallow rock pool good for the smaller kids and deep ones to enjoy for the bigger ones too. Road in was corrugated and rough in some spots but still good enough to be able to tow our van. 2wd could get there. Pool at the bottom of falls looked beautiful too we didn't swim here but there were plenty of other ppl swimming. A must see destination in kakadu.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"After visiting Gunlom 12 years ago we were keen to return this time. The camp ground was dustier and busier than we remembered, but the camp manager was nice and the facilities in good order. One disappointment was the lack of ANY BBQ facilities (no fire hot plates and gas bbqs out of order). The scenery is spectacular, beautiful swimming and a nice walk to the top of the waterfall rewards you with the amazing infinity view."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Access takes twenty minutes via a dusty, corrugated road. The campground was basic but had plenty of space first week of July (peak season). It is an easy five-minute walk to the pond. The waterfall rock pools above, take 15 minutes to reach on an uneven trail. The view is spectacular looking across the pools to the horizon. Great photo ops."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"My husband and I had a fantastic day there, we walked to the top of the falls, it is a steep narrow path, but if you take your time most people with a reasonable level of fitness can make it up and. Ack, at the top is a water hole you can swim in which after the climb is most welcome, the view from the top is stunning to say the least - a huge thank you to #kakadutourism for a fantastic day Kevin our guide for the day was fantastic- would recommend them to any one wanting a day tour. We even had a sundowner near the billabong - all in all a great day."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Gunlom Waterfall Creek is a fantastic away from it all adventure for the whole family. From heavy-duty 4WDs to small hatchbacks this is one of the many amazing places to visit in Kakadu National Park. Campers to day-trippers make the journey on the corrugated unsealed road. It's a 47km drive off the Kakadu Highway but well worth it to make the climb to the infinity pools. The steep climb is challenging at times but parents with babies in backpacks and people hauling giant pool toys are not deterred. If that's too much there is a beautiful swimming hole at the bottom of the falls and easily accessible. Lots of great camping sites with fire pits and clean basic shower and toilet facilities. If you plan to camp and stay a couple of days take a tent and plenty of water. Camping fees are $38.50 for a family. You should also note there is no mobile service in this area however that adds to the getting away from it all! Highly recommend taking this trip in the Top End dry season as the area is not always accessible in the wet season.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The creek is above the pool below the falls. The pool is a family friendly place to take a swim. A pool with a soft sand bottom which is shallow, to begin with, but gets deeper further out. Toilets at the parking and a camping with its own facilities too. Easy road to the place. A bit bumpy but could be driven with any vehicle that day. The horizon pool on top of the fall demands a step climb to get to. Not for the unfit to try."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"If you can get here without the hordes it is fantasmagorical!!! Avoid weekends, school and public holidays. Definately need 4WD. You need to be fit to climb to the top (& most famous) swimming hole. It is super steep and narrow. Take your time. People have died on this track. Not suitable for littlies people. Keep them safe."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,We visited here as part of a tour as our second stop for the day where we had our picnic lunch before tackling the very steep and rocky 1.5 km return climb of 20 floors but again at the end the reward was spectacular. There were several levels to the rock pools and you could even get to the infinity rock pool that was featured in crocodile Dundee. It was amazing to swim up there and also take in the great views back over Kakadu. Unfortunately the lower pool was still closed as the rangers were not sure that it was clear of crocodiles yet but it was still magic. One of the Highlights of our NT trip.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Hard walk to the top. Didn't want to risk it with the kids (3, 1) so we stayed at the bottom pool while Dad went up. Pools at the top looked amazing. Pool at the bottom was ok. Good for kids with a sandy beach and easy access to the water."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,A beautiful shady place with 2 swimming holes. The lower one is very easy walking access. You probably need a 4wd unless it's the best of weather. Great place for a picnic.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"think the road had been graded recently as the corrugations were manageable without being distressing. Bit dusty following another car, but a wee breeze helped. the walk up to the top of the falls is steep and rocky with some areas you need to hang on, but its over fairly quickly, to come out at the best place in Kakadu!. several pools to the postcard infinity pool. magic. Fair amount of shade to picnic under. Back at car park there is a toilet block, and a campground. you can swim in bottom plunge pool ...go left to beach area."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Just a stunning location. A long drive on a corrugated dirt road - we managed it in a 2 wheel drive, but it is uncomfortable! The drive is well worth it with a stunning waterfall into a swimming pool. We suggest you push yourself and do the walk to the top (it is rated a hard walk), but is marked and again stunning. It offers views for hundreds of miles over Kakadu and some stunning swimming pools at the top of the Falls. Beautiful red rock and lovely green pools with little waterfalls. A definite walk to do."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"fantastic, highlight of Kakadu, the swimming pools at the top make the short steep walk/climb well worth it, must do."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We were told it was an moderate climb to reach the infinity pool,it was not.I had to stop after 10 minutes and make my way back down,my friends carried on and when they returned they said the pool was amazing but the climb was extremely hard and dangerous. Be warned"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,After a 1km vertical climb the reward at the top is incredible infinity pools to swim in. The view from up here are amazing. Plenty of energy to climb after gourmet lunch provided by kakadu tourism. Tour guide Luke was brilliant
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"A rather tough climb in parts up the escarpment, so wear good shoes, hat, sunscreen and take water. Wear your swimmers - the Infinity Pool is gorgeous. Wonderful to plunge into the crystal water after a sturdy hike."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"My partner and I took my mum out to Gunlom for a 2 night camp and it was brilliant. My partner and I gunned it to the top of the falls just before sunset which took about 20 mins at a fast pace, but it was totally worth it. We had the top of the falls and the inifinity pool to ourselves for sunset overlooking the breathtaking birds eye view of Kakadu National Park. We just made it back down as it got dark, so take a torch if you go at sunset! Next morning we three went back to the top - mum had a bad knee so we took the climb slowly (it is a rocky and steep trail) and after about an hour we were at the top. Busier this time of day (about 11am) with tourists, but still amazing and great to see the view again by day. Lots of little parts of the creek to swim in and falls to dip your head under. Worth a couple of hours at the top so take water and snacks. Around lunchtime as we left it was getting quite crowded so I'd suggest the sunset and morning treks up the top are the way to go! Worth mentioning the campsite facilities were good, plenty of space, fire pits, places to wash up, decent showers and toilets. Also a must is the swimming hole at the bottom of the falls, however not as clear and refreshing as the top pools."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,rough road in. No power. Showers clean. very dusty (might be better earlier in dry season though. the falls are awesome though. Walk NOT suitable for very young or elderly.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The road in July was one of the worst we encountered, and that included the Gibb River Road. I wouldn't have done it if I didn't have a 4WD. I did see a Mazda 6 in the car park and we passed a VW beetle on the way out. I hope they made it without serious damage. The falls were not running, and the climb up to the pools at the top of the falls was reasonably difficult at times. The view from the top was worth the effort and water was clean and refreshing."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"If you like hiking and also swimming then Gunlom is the perfect option for a day out. The carpark area has toilets, WiFi, and picnic areas. The walk to the top of the swimming holes is about 30 minutes for a fit person. The Swimming holes are great and the view terrific."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The water holes size is quite large, you have plenty of space to yourself and off trails to explore."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Have been coming here since school camp and the novelty doesn't wear off. You have to climb up the top. It only takes 20-30 minutes to climb, and allow yourself atleast an hour or two at the top for a swim and explore. We took a couple of coldies up with us to enjoy at the edge and it is gorgeous. Make sure you wear your climbing shoes and take a camelback if you have one 😊"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Best investment on this trip is our trekking poles. As we watched young kids race up the hill we were glad for the extra help. Well worth the effort to the top. Views are spectacular and the swim in the pools so welcomed. Do it.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Steep climb to the swimming holes but absolutely worth it. My 6 year old managed it. We were the only ones there and it was just perfect.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,3 of us did the walk upto the top to see the pools. It is a hard hot walk. Take plenty of water. Dont forget your bathers. At the top swim in the pools and check out the infinitey pool. Beware the rocks beneath the water. Take it slow. And take it slow on the way down.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,It was quiet hot and a very steep climb to the falls. A must to pack water and have your swimmers on ready to swim as soon as you reach the top. The views were lovely and the water was very refreshing.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"To experience Kakadu I really recommend visiting the southern part of the park, including this amazing oasis. The walk to the top of the falls done early gave us the infinity pool section basically to ourselves. It really is wonderful! We took floating tyres which was relaxing."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,This hike rises quickly so pack plenty of water. It can be done by families easily with kids. Pack togs and towel. Allow 30min each way and 60min to swim and take photos
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"It's a hard climb in hot conditions but the treat waits at the top. Great views over the valley from a group of 3 natural rock pools. You need to be fit and agile, bring your togs and camera."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,This is a vertical climb and we made the mistake of doing it in the middle of the day. My Aussie husband was certain we couldn't swim in the falls because of crocs. Big mistake. The dip would have made the climb worthwhile and the view really requires you swim out to the edge.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Of all the Kakadu watefalls and gorges, Gunlom is the most accessible and right near the camping ground. families were having great fun swimming and the more adventurous walked to the top of the falls but it lacked the pristine water and remoteness of other falls such as Maguk."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The 30km road in was quite variable with the first portion very poor, after that it improved. Still worth it but road needs some TLC. The lower pool was very special with 70m sheer cliffs and a waterfall. Almost anyone could access the lower pool. It is bordered on one side by a white sand beach which make water access easy. The upper pool requires a level of fitness but take your time and enjoy the view going up. The upper pool has the famous waterfall edge and has panaramic views over the surrounds. But don't stop there. There is a further pool above this which can be accessed from a side track to the right as you decend into the first upper pool. The second upper pool has a great swim in between sheer rocks which is very special. Spend some time and you will start to feel the essence of Kakadu."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We did the Gunlom Waterfall Creek hike just over a week ago, the hike is easy but steep, take your time to get up, stop along the way to see the vistas and enjoy the nature around you. Some great rockpools along the way and at the top in the infinity pool with some amazing views of the surrounding area. Definitely worth the time to get there and please don’t leave your trash or we will lose nice things like this."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Not the easiest of walks due to the number of rocks covered in sand making it slippery. Mostly a flat walk in a very pretty gorge. This is the pick at this time of year due to the lack of water prior to the wet season. Highly recomended for the able body person. During the walk to the falls, we noticed the bark of a tree move all by itself. Note the picture of a tree where there is a bark coloured grass hopper. I have know idea what it's called."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This is my 2nd visit here, lovely green grass in the common area, ok toilets, steep hike to the top of the falls and the signage could be a little better on the way up, the arrows have faded, but the view up the top is very special"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"It was a fairly long drive into Gunlom. Unhooked the caravan at a free camp just down the road and drive in on the dusty and corrugated road. (Not as bad as some) After the toughest climb I've done in a while I reached the top (I had been soooooo excited to see this place and wanted my photo on the edge of the infinity pool. I found the waterfall barely flowing and the water was green and not very inviting. I looked down on the bottom pool which was green also, do after the climb down I decided to move on without going there for a swim. Maybe we left it a bit too late after the wet, but then all other places we visited had beautiful clear water. Not sure what to make of this place. (The water in this pic looks blue but was green ) Amazing views."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The climb up to the top was not too bad, wear runners, some people were climbing up in thongs but makes it easier to slip. The pools are fantastic up the top, you could spend quite some time up here cooling down, can't wait to go back."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom falls is a 30 odd km drive down a dirt road that 2WD vehicles are suppose to be able to go, but when we were there the corrugations in the road would break may 4WDs let alone 2WDs. Shocking road - needs grading. Having said that the drive is well worth it. The campground is fairly basic, but the facilities are good and in the day-use area there is free WI-FI for those that want to know what is going on in the world. The waterfall is very pretty but you are advised not to swim in the Plunge Pool at the bottom, but the short walk to the top is well worth it. Not only because you can swim in the infinity pools at the top, but the vista over the park is spectacular."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Great camping area. Basic amenities. The camp is a short walk to the falls and nice swimming here. Really enjoyed the walk to the top of the falls, excellent views and refreshing swim."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This was a lovely place. The campsite there includes toilets and showers and it is a lovely stay, with the night stars being incredibly bright. The waterfall wasn't running much when we were there bit would be lovely after rain. The lower plunge pool would normally be a lovely swim but when we were there a crocodile had been spotted that morning so no swimming allowed. The climb to the upper lookout and plunge pool was steep and not for the faint hearted...we didn't attempt it. The main issue with Gunlom was the road access. The road was badly corrugated and quite rough in places. While listed as accessible by 2WD I would not do it - some parts would easily trash a normal vehicle's suspension. The road is on bad need of a grader and drivers need to act a little more responsibly by driving slower to reduce the corrugations forming. A pleasant stay but 4WD recommended only."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Bush waking mountain climbing swimming and watching amazing view for sure its exactly what you want to do when you go outdoor. I highly recommend this place . Me and my friends enjoyed everything that was there
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Visited to camp overnight with son and grandson. Road in is a corrugated red dust shocker but 4wd with pressure in tyres lowered by 10lbs (restored with with compressor when returned to sealed road) coped well. Camp ground at base of falls is well maintained with the $15 per adult overnight charge. This is collected by rangers who visit each camper at day's end. Amenities have hot water and flushing toilets. We swam the base pool in the afternoon and trekked to the top pools the next morning as sun rose over the mountain. The steep climb is best attempted in joggers rather than thongs or sandals, which assists descent too. Once up the top the cool clear pools are a delight and the views out across the bush valley stunning. Take water and fruit because you will need replenishing after the trek up. Much enjoyed."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom is approximately a 500km round trip from Darwin via either Pine Creek or Jabiru and the bitumen roads are good BUT there is a 40km section of dirt which is the worst corrugated road and very hard on 2wd vehicles let alone 4wd. The camp site has toilets and showers but no other facilities like a little shop for ice etc so make sure you are self sufficient. The The Ranger comes around 6pm collects camping fees of $15 per head per night. If you are not a local then you will also be charged an entry fee to Kakadu of $25 per head. The pool below the escarpment is fantastic, only 200m from the camp site and you can also climb to the top of the waterfalls but wear good footwear."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Nice place to see and have a quick dip. The walk up to the top is good. Take your time though. The view is nice however shame tou can see caepark and camp ground. The infinity pool is nice and in my opinion better than the one at lake argyle. The road in was a 30 ks of terrible corrigation.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This place was magical. It was a bit of a trek to get up to the top, but when you got there the views were amazing, the rock pools refreshing and the lovely soft fresh water was soothing. It was just a lovely place to hang and drop from pool to pool as well as sit under the little water fall for a should massage from nature. This is at the bottom end of the park, closer to Pine Creek, and in my opinion, the better end of the park. There was also a pool at the bottom and a park with shade and picnic tables for lunch."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"On my bucket list to reach the infinity pool at Gunlum and what an amazing place this is, don't miss it. Plunge pool easily accessible from the campground , great place to go. Road in very corrugated, 4wd not 2wd"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"There is a 30+km gravel access road to Gunlom, which is quite corrugated at times, and very very dusty, so go slow when passing vehicles travelling in the other direction. If you don't, you lose visibility on a twisty, windy road, which could be dangerous. The camp ground is very good, plenty of camps available (generator and non-generator areas) with good toilets and showers. The climb up to the top of Gunlom waterfall is quite steep and hot at times, so take some drinking water with you. It's worth the climb to experience Gunlom. At the very top, enter the pool, and swim over some shallow rocks to get to the ""back"" where there is a small waterfall. It is just gorgeous. There are several lower and larger pools that are beautiful to swim in, including a pool that is like an ""infinity"" pool. Definitely worth spending a couple of hours there, and I would definitely go again!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,This place is just beautiful! A good workout to get up to the top pool but the view and secluded nature of it makes the hard work worth it! The 37km drive in is a bit rough so whilst you don't need a 4WD I wouldn't do it in a lowered car!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,It's a tough drive in there in a small hire car but worth it. Absolutely beautiful! The climb to the top isn't difficult and well worth the effort. The pools at the top are stunning and the views amazing. Don't miss this.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,a 20 minute walk and you have your self an infinity pool at the top of a waterfall to swim in. you just cant buy that!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We stayed at the Gunlom campsite for 2 nights & was the best camp site we stayed during our 5 nights in tents at Kakadu & Litchfield. The camp site had plenty of space and the toilets, hot showers and washing up areas were all good. It seemed well maintained, with only the showers a little old and dirty (so thongs required). The trek up to the top plunge pool was quite a challenge, but worth it. The water down the bottom with the beach was also very nice - we were advised not to swim the bottom due to crocs, but plenty of people were. Would recommend Gunlom campsite - the 30km dirt road off the main road was not too bad, but makes it a bit less convenient to use as a base camp for day tours around Kakadu."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This is a must do for kakadu visitors. Whilst it's a little out of the way and the road is rough, the views are spectacular and the swimming to die for. It was very busy the day we were there during the school holidays, so either avoid the holidays or get there first thing in the morning or last thing in the day."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"It is worth the drive if you have a 4WD, as it is nearly 40km of corrugated road into this area, which has toilets, grassed picnic area and camping ground. You can visit the pool at the base, which is a short walk from the car park. The ascend to the top is a bit of a climb, average fitness would be fine. At the top there is a fork, go left with the handrail to get to the main infinity pool, this is the iconic picture perfect setting for enjoyment. Trek a little further on and you get to the top pools which are quieter and just as much fun. Don't miss this gem if you can navigate the road...."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Need to be semi fit to climb to top but it's worth it, watch the submerged rocks so no jumping or diving in. Wet season would be spectacular."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,My partner and I visited Gunlom at the end of our day and we spent a couple of hours on top of the waterfall in the pools which was perfect. My suggestion would be to get here mid afternoon to camp for the night. That way you can get the sunset and sunrise from the top which would be a great experience.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom Falls really is as amazing as the pictures suggest. However, there are some issues that you should be aware of before you go: From the highway, it is 37km of unmade roads to get to the falls. I'm sure it's fine in a big 4WD, but it was a bit of a challenge in the small 2WD I had. To get to the pools at the top, it is a bit of a climb on a rocky track. If you are of average fitness, it should be no problem, though. There is also a plunge pool down the bottom of the falls, but it really is worth the hike to get to the top. If you are traveling in peak season, it would probably be best to get there early - despite the difficulty in getting there, it was really busy when we were there."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Be aware that many a rental cannot travel here due to dirt road. To be honest the road is not that bad but if you can make it here its well worth half a day. Would love to come back one day to spend a few days camping here.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Loved this place - we arrived reasonably early before it got too crowded (busloads of tourists were dropped off late morning!) and swam in the highest pools, up through the rocks, climbed some smallish boulders to access more secluded pools and a trickling waterfall and small cave right near the very source. If you're into climbing, you could go further and explore, not difficult for someone with climbing experience. Very slippery and risky for the inexperienced. Incredible place, the pools are full of deep holes, but there's lots of shallow boulders to stand on (be careful jumping off rocks into the water - lots of hidden, shallow sharp rocks around). We went down to the infinity edge pool just for photos, but it was crowded, with lots of screaming kids, and not the peaceful wonderland like in the photos! There's another pool at the base, easy access for crocs, so we didn't go in, but people had their kids in there. We liked that it was not an easy climb to the top, it would have been even more crowded if it was a stroll! You'll break a sweat, but as long as you are able bodied, you can get there at your own pace, makes the swim even better! Plenty of spots to stop and rest if you need it (and to allow people to pass). Remember to be courteous to others on the trail!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Despite the steep walk up to it, Gunlom was definitely worth the effort. Although the water level was low, the views of the National Park were spectacular, and the water was quite refreshing."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,This is a special place.really tranquil and once you have driven the rd a beautiful picnic spot and camping area and easy walk to pool.kids climbed up to infinity pools and totally enjoyed it. Lots of families and kids have a great time.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Not the easiest climb - quite steep in parts and rocky but well worth the effort- the views from the top are amazing and the infinity pool is gorgeous. Because it is in the sun the water is beautiful, not too cold and still very refreshing for a dip after the long climb up. We spent an easy couple of hours up there and in the water- plenty of shaded spots too for a snack and relaxing in without fear of sunburn. Loved it."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Gunlom Falls in Kakadu National Park is stunning..preferably go by 4WD but can do in 2WD but not recommended..severe corrugation and large pot holes in the dry. Bottom of falls is a lovely sandy beach for all ages..a huge climb to the top where there are multiple infinity pools that are popular amongst the fitter and younger people. Has a lovely picnic area where we saw a dingo..and a ranger..lol..there is also a camping ground..just a dream come true to actually have been at this remarkable site..!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Access is via a reasonably long drive on a dirt road which has been recently graded. Some work still going on so watch out for trucks and piles of dirt on the road. Beautiful picnic area and swimming hole at base of falls but don't miss the walk to the top. Quite steep and challenging climb over rocks but so worth it. The infinity pool at the top is amazing. Would suggest going after 2pm or later to avoid crowds and still get back off the dirt road before dark. Take swimmers, water, camera and insect repellent and wear hiking boots or joggers."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Would definitely visit again if travelling Kakadu again. Just so beautiful and untouched! Highly recommend!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This is a remote place which has a large pool, a wonderful waterfall and above a series of natural infinity pool. From the south ranger station it is nearly one hour drive on a reasonably graded dirt road. We did it easily with a normal car but in the wet a 4 wheels may be required. The ride itself is beautiful with hills, vista, small creeks, huge termites nests until you wreathe waterfall Creak Falls and a beautiful lake and a camping area. From there there is a small ride and a steep walk to Gonlom Pool. The view was spectacular and in early December we were the only people around."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Very nice and quiet place during this period of the year. The walk is not easy. You need to be in good condition.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom was probably my favourite place in all of Kakadu (it's hard to choose, everything was impressive). The view across to the mountains from the rock pools at the top are breath taking. Gunlom is considered a very sacred place, and is a well work the trek to the top to relax and soak in all it's natural beauty. It's lovely for sunset but make sure you give yourself enough time to get back down before it is dark. The hike to the top took around 20-25 minutes and was a bit strenuous and vertiginous in some parts. The track is quite well marked with arrows and starts very close to the campsite and parking lot."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We visited Gunlom on our whirlwind one day tour of Kakadu. We started with a dawn visit to Mumukala bird hide - fantastic. Breakfast, then onto Ubirr to see the rock art - also fantastic. Off to the Bowali Visitor centre to get some more information. Then we headed to Gunlom. It is at the southern end of the Park and about 150 km from Jabiru to the turn off, then 37 km on dirt. On arrival, we climbed up the marked walking track to the top of the cliff to the rock pools. We were not disappointed. Water in all the pools early October, with a trickle over the water fall. A great place to float and cool down after a hectic day. The location and afternoon light was stunning. All the places we visited were special, though Gunlom comes near the top of memorable locations in Kakadu for all sorts of reasons for me."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"I was worried that there would be very little water in the pools, as we visited in late September at the end of a long and dry season. However, water was still trickling in. The iconic 'infinity pool' picture was not possible as the water was a little low for that. Still lots of swimming opportunities though. Beautiful views out across Kakadu. It was quite crowded when we were there (and it was considered to be a quiet period). I'd imagine in peak times it would be very busy. Best swimming is in the pools further back. 20 minute rock scramble to reach the pools. The road in was good quality."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We head to Gunlom Falls (also known as Waterfall Ck Falls, or UDP Falls) most years as a quick camp away from Darwin with friends. We go to Gunlom with friends because some of them only have 2 wheel drive vehicles and it is still relatively accessible to them providing they take it easy. We've had friends go in with an Astra and a Corolla. The road signs recommend 4wd, and the road can be very corrugated, however just take it slow - it's only about 30km. The campground is fantastic, it has an area for those with generators, tents and campers/caravans. It also has showers and toilets which are well maintained. Fees are about $10 per adult. The waterfall is lovely and the pool at the base is worth a swim - it's quite cold though! There are a few fresh water crocs in here but they won't come near you. The best bit though is the plunge pools up the top! There is a moderately difficult walk to the top with loose rocks (may be difficult for elderly). We usually take an esky carried by a couple of us blokes with lunch and drinks for us and the kids, then we stay up there for most of the day. Most people go up and have a swim, and then they get hungry or thirsty and have to go back down! We do try to avoid public holidays because it does get busy - we'd rather it a bit quieter! photos: Can't find my pics of the waterfall..."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"After a short walk uphill (not too complicated) for 30 mins or less you reach the pools, with an astonishing view from the top. Really worth a batch there chilling after a hot day. You can stay at the bottom and not going up to the pools. On the campground there is a picnic area and a nice lake from where you can see the water falls (which comes from Gunlom Pool)"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This place is (at least when we were there) one of the very few places in the area you can swim in, after a 30 min minimum steep hike to the rocks pools you get to swim in beautiful cool water with water falls and a panoramic view as you are perched about 150m above the ground below, it's just breathtaking. The road to get there is ok for 2WD if it's dry, it is rough but we did it in a small hire car no issues, just take some extra time. Ask the locals about the track condition before you set out. If it has been raining you will need a 4x4 or the track may even be closed. From Jabiru to Gunlom took us about 2:45."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The walk to the top is about a kilometre, and you need to be fit and this is a difficult climb, have plenty of drinking water. There are several pools up the top, but if you don't want to go to the top there is a another watering hole about 200metres away, a flat walk. The grounds are watered so there are lots of places to have a picnic etc before heading off"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom is definitely worth the effort go getting there. Nice campground and picnic area and a stunning 85m waterfall. The plunge pool is easy to get to and a great swim, but the real gold nugget is the walk to the top and swim in the rock pools. Sure it's steep, but if you take your time, you will be rewarded with an amazing view, sort of like a natural infinity pool 85m high, looking over the plunge pool and surrounding area."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Great place to spend the afternoon, just be aware of the rough drive out. The camp site is great, the park ranger gave a presentation on ""bush tucker"" which is best to save until after dinner. The facilities are basic, but clean with toilets, showers and barbecue pits."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"What a place!!! It takes a while to get to and the roads are not the best so make sure you have a 4x4, then a walk up to the pools will test your cardio, but the journey is worth it! The view from the plunge pools is breathtaking!! Especially with a beer in hand!! You will loose track of time as you take it all in!! The camping grounds are fantastic as well and the wild brumbies that make their way through the camp site at night will ensure another unique experience"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"While getting into Gunlom can present a challenge for some it is definitely worth the effort. Here is nature in all its splendour, from the intense colour of the rocks in the surroundings through to the various pools above the waterfall. The walk up and into the pool area from the visitor or campground area, requires a degree of fitness and ability to clamber over and around rocks especially when coming down into the pool area. Once there you are rewarded with a choice of pools to relax in and soak up the sublime surroundings created by nature over the Millenia. The best view is from the pool perched at the edge of the waterfall, a natural infinity pool, which provides views across the valley. Make sure you are well prepared: take food and water, wear sensible footwear and sunscreen as you will want to spend some time here."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"One of the best most beautiful places in between Darwin & Katherine, really worth the visit and a swim!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Great plunge pool at the bottom of the falls. Very demanding walk up to the top of the Falls along a very rocky path (we are young 72 yo), but well worth the effort. The Rock pools at the top are a gem and a truly unique experience. We travelled 130 kms from Jabiru to the turn off and then 37 kms on an unsealed road (with a 2wd). Was it worth it, absolutely and would do it again (if my legs would stop aching from the walk up and down)"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Stunning location is worth the 35k drive. The dusk there is like a scene from a film. The sunset will never compare to this again
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Located way down at the southern end of Kakadu. Its probably best accessed from Katherine or Pine Creek than Darwin. There is a 37km rough dirt road at the end of the blacktop. 4wd is the best option, but once there you will never regret it. There is a huge pool at the bottom of the escarpment which is created by the massive waterfall which runs only in the wet season. However this is not the main attraction here. A quick 15 minute climb up the near vertical escarpment will have you at the main attraction. (15mins for the fit and adventurous) Here a spectacular infinity pool sits on the top of the escarpment before plunging hundreds of feet below. The views to the horizon and the paperbark forest surrounding the plunge pool below are sensational. Upstream there are many more secluded swimming holes and a few more flowing waterfalls. Sunset and sunrise are the best times to visit. If the water feature are not enough then this location is topped off with lovely green lawns, bbq's and full hot and cold showers in the camp ground. What is really surprising is the showers never seem to run out of hot water. There is good reason why Gunlom has been voted one of the top natural swimming holes in the world...... it is!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The pools on top of Gunlom are really cool, really worth going up there. The walk is a bit steep in some sessions but it's quite short. Sunset seen from the lookout on top is amazing. If you stay for sunset, bring your flashlight and stay there as long as you can. The colours in the sky after the sun is already down are amazing."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,This is a magical place. Bit of a drive in on 35km of good quality dirt road then a real rock scrabble to the top of the escarpment but the views are magnificent. We went in early June after a lower than normal wet so not a lot of water over the falls but the pools were still beautiful. The rock is so smooth. Do not miss it.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The rock pools at the top of Gunlom falls are just magic and like something out of a movie set! My wife didn't do the climb up the stairs to it and has regretted it ever since she saw the photos. The kids and I had one of the best days of our lives there, serously its that good! The climb isn't that hard and is only about 10 mins anyway so make sure you do it."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This was probably my top choice in the Kakadu National park, stunning stunning stunning ! If heaven is on earth, I think its here, You'll need reasonable fitness as its a steady upwards rock climb, but having said that, a delightful family with a 1 & 3 year old made the trek, baby on mums back & 3 year old in dads arms & all smiling when they reached the top !"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"After surviving the climb to the top of the falls, the view was stunning and the swim in the rock pool wonderful"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Great Great spot. Very nice spacious campground, short walk to massive bottom plunge pool - but the top pool is the star attraction. 30-45 min walk up the top, we did it late arvo / sunset - and it is photographers heaven. Take a torch for the walk down after sunset. The various pools are all great - beautiful spot."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,I lived in Darwin for four years and this is by far my favourite place to visit! The infinity pool at the top is definitely worth the climb. Spectacular views across Kakadu! A couple times we've hiked up with a cold beer and cheese / crackers to witness the most amazing sunsets. The feeling of isolation and just how insignificant you are in comparison to the size of Kakadu is an overwhelming feeling experienced at the Gunlom plunge pool. Just an amazingly beautiful spot!!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The view from the top is spectacular with 3 different pools to swim in. Make sure you carry plenty of water as it is a hot dry walk. Well worth the effort to get to the top. Moderate climb - some areas where you will need to step up and down so not for those with bad knees or ankles.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The 500m walk up the cliff is moderate. You do have to step up on rocks. A couple of places to stop and rest. I have a child with special needs, it was challenging, but we made it. Totally worth it once you reach the plunge pools. Truly amazing. Take your towels and water. Some people were organised and had picnic lunch up there."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom falls was incredible, pretty steep walk to the top, only takes about 20mins, but the top is more than worth it!! Beautiful plunge pools and infinity pools! You can see for miles up there!! Swim upstream at the very top to find a pretty waterfall that not many people visit. Friendly staff at the campsite and good amenities, 2wd unsealed road to reach gunlom. Do not miss out!!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Mossies and midgies were not as bad as the night before at Ubirr, in fact we hardly noticed them. The plunge pool is to be seen to be believed and we spent a couple of hours swimming. A sandy clean bottom meant no mud.The walk up to the falls was fantastic and the views of the local area are quite a pleasant surprise."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Our second visit here and it was just as beautiful as the first time we saw it . Unfortunately the waterfall was only just running and may stop soon:( so check before you go. The pool at the top is so stunning and has the most spectacular views across Kakadu. Fun places for kids to jump off cliffs into the water safely . The walk up is quite hard and please wear good walking shoes - don't wear thongs / flip flops !!!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This was a walk that led to amazing pools set high above the planes below. It was equally as stunning as Kakadu and almost as stunning as Katherine Gorge. We picked the hottest part of the day to do it, but the pool at the top made the walk worthwhile and we quickly cooled down after we plunged in the fresh water trickling into the pools."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We walked up to the plunge pools twice (early morning and late afternoon). Early morning was perfect as we were the first there. Stunning when the sun started to hit the water. Late afternoon it was very busy but still a nice swim after a long walk. The walk is a bit tricky (especially with a 4 and 2 year old) but manageable, just take your time. Gunlom was very very busy when we were there. The campground was almost full, people were camped on top of each other and the music played at night was annoying and caused some arguments that we could hear in some areas. Our fault for staying there on a weekend. Not to be missed though, it is a lovely spot."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The road into Gunlom is dirt and in places very corrugated, recommend letting tyre pressure down. On arrival you are greeted with a lovely grassy picnic area. The walk up a very steep incline took about 25 minutes with some areas of difficulty. Saving grace was at 10.30am a lot of the walk was in shade. Up the top is 4 rock pools and we swam in all of them, such beauty. We came down for a picnic lunch then swam in the large rock pool at the bottom. Unpowered camping available."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The trek up to the infinity plunge pool is hard! (Especially with 3 kids 7, 5 and 2.5 in back pack... essential!) But the pools at top were amazing! Doesn't get much better than this and our favourite in N.T!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom has a plunge pool which is wheelchair (and croc) accessible and it is nice if you can't climb like a mountain goat - but if you can handle a 20 min steep rocky climb you MUST head up top to the half dozen large pools above the waterfall that feeds the plunge pool as it is one of nature's finest creations! Deep, clear, green and not a croc in sight, these pools also boast incredible views over the land beyond the waterfall. Take a picnic lunch, lots of water and spend the day exploring all the pools."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,We didn't really know what we were going to do in Kakadu and travelers we meet in Katherine recommended Gunlom. And what a surprise it was. A walk up the hill offset by the pools at the top. Not many places to swim in Kakadu so it was lovely to do so. Gravel road in but ok for a 2WD.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The climb to the top may seem daunting, but once you reach the plunge pool area you are rewarded with one of the most magnificent natural rock pools ever seen. The road from the highway is a bit bumpy and a fair trek but like all of Kakadu it offers such beautiful scenery to look at along the way. You park your car in a well marked car parking area and then make the climb up the hill. It is definitely hard going but seems a lot easier on the way down. There are no change facilities or toilets up the top, just pure natural rock pools and water. Cant wait to go again."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"June is the perfect time to visit, not too hot. I was last here 2 years ago, and the road was much better although still very corrugated in places. There were not too many people when I have been so its a very peaceful place. I swam in both the lower and upper pools, and the water was just stunning. The walk to the top can be managed by most people so don't be put off heading to the top. It's well worth it. The grassed areas was shaded with trees, and there are tables and chairs."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Local Darwin people that never get sick of making the trip to Gunlom. Road can slow you down a bit. This trip the road was great. Make the trip, you won't regret it."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom was, simply put, the highlight of our Kakadu trip. After the 4WD trek in, we were rewarded with the most spectacular experience. The climb up to the top of the falls is hard and I would advise anyone going up to wear sturdy footwear, for the track is very rough in places. However, once up, you can soothe those feet in crystal clear, cool water while surveying the landscape around you. It is an experience like no other, especially with the natural infinity pool effect. In order to get the best experience (and photos), go up an hour before sunset. That way, the groups have all left and the water is ever so still. You'll have the pools to yourself and some remarkable colours to look at."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This place is a must....it's a very steep climb but well worth the effort, our 6 year old did the climb. Just take plenty of water and take your time, it's not a race. When you get to the top you could spend hours swimming in the pools. No crocs up that high so safe to swim."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We enjoyed the drive in and out, sensational swimming area! Really nice picnic area's as well for BBq's even if your only a day visitor! You can also do the walk up the top to the upper pools above the falls. Worth the hike!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Be careful what car you take there since it's a 36 kms corrugated dirt road. But the end is worth it. I haven't really been to the plunge pool but the upper one are really nice, with a great view on the park and no risk of crocs. That's one of the few places in Kakadu you can have a swim. I didn't saty camping but the place looks big and well equipped with showers and BBQ."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,What an amazing gem hidden away in Kakadu! With a walk easily accomplished by a two year old to reach the clear waters of the plunge pool. We had it to ourselves! It was early in the day but....you do need to bring something to float around in unless you want to rock hop or tread water for a long time. As a quiet relaxing place Kakadu offers none better!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"A bit of a walk to begin with, good idea to go early in the morning or even late afternoon, the view at the top is just stunning, and with a wee walk further down there is a few lovely rock pools to relax and swim in :) Highly Recommened"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,love the feeling swim a littel further up the back and you can see wild Lizards and deep pools of love
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,It takes a bit of a climb to get here but it is very worthwile....for a short time we had the pool all to ourself and we enjoyed the piece and quietness and the great view. A small piece of heaven on earth. Take a plunge to experience it. Make sure to bring food/something to drink as you will not be able to buy it. But also make sure to leave nothing behind to keep the place nice & clean for others to enjoy it as well.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Nature certainly has built a wonderful secluded few pools on the top of the Waterfalls. Strenuous 15-20 mins hike up in the 45 degree heat can shed some sweat but the moment you see the pools, it certainly becomes worth the effort. We visited in October just before the wet season. Water was bit less but still beautiful. We couldn't help but swim on all levels of the ponds. I'd definitely go back and this time it'll be just after the Wet season. Just to be able to take photos of the ""Natural Infinity Pool"". Road on the way is corrugated - roughly 39kms off the main Kakadu HWY. 4WD recommended."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,What a Fabulous place! A little hot for camping this time of year but definitely worth the time to visit and see the spectacular pools!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Worth the hike to to the top, we went in October before the wet and there was still plenty of water, bring some walking shoes"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We spent our second night here. I could have stayed forever. The drive in was fun, we were in a 4x 4 and did the trek in no problem, a bit rough in a 2wheel drive. The first view of the waterfall is beautiful, after setting up camp we decide to hike to the top. WOW the view at the top is worth the strenuous 15 walk. It has the best view of anything I have seen in my life. The infinity pool is truly amazing. The water is warm and no crocodiles. After swimming for a couple of hours we walk back down, a lot easier. It was beautiful lying in bed listening to the waterfall all night. The next morning we hiked back up to spend a few hours soaking up the best view in the world. Kakadu is the most beautiful place in the world."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Came here as part of a 3-day 4WD tour of Kakadu National Park. Saw the plunge pool at the foot of the hill but we decided to skip that as apparently, there had been a freshwater crocodile sighting not far from the camp grounds several days earlier. We'd also heard a lot from our guide about how scenic the terraced pools were from the top. It turned out to be quite a hike from the foot of the hill, and fairly steep in some parts. But what amazing views from the top! We were blessed with clear skies on the day we were there, and we could see for miles across the South Alligator River valley and the Marrawal plateau. But really, the plunge pools were an attraction in their own right. Nice areas to just sit around and relax. In the deeper pools, the water was noticeably dark, presumably from runoff of plant-based tannin, but it was clean. And while there was little danger from the current of the water flowing past, just be careful not to get too close to the edge - it's a fairly long way down."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"just google the photos, it is a bit of a walk and steep but still the best place to swim in kakadu. love it, if you dont feel like the walk you can swim att he base"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,We went there with a 2wd car (corolla) Was a bit hard but you can do it during dry season. It worth the way. Plunge pool with cascade is amazing and very refreshing. Nice spot for a pic nic and a swim.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The most scenic pool I've been to. Hot and steep walk up but totally worth it! The view is amazing. The picnic area below is well worth sticking around for too. It is shady and grassy and very peaceful. The resident park ranger is friendly and helpful and sells icy poles for $1 (totally worth it when you're baking in the heat!!). The drive in was on a long gravel road. Sections of it can be difficult for a 2WD. However, the car park had a few rental Hydundai Getz there, so it is possible!!!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,It's off the beaten track but well worth the effort. I was there in the wet and the bottom of the falls was like a giant spa pool on turbo plus. Up the top of the falls the views are magic.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Spent the night there and walked to the top, Excellent indeed! Need to see it if you are in the area. Well worth it."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Drive in is a challenge, but the prize is well worth it. The walk up is a short but exhausting climb, however what waits at the end is amazing. The pool and the view is just breathtaking. I can spend hours up there. Best infinity pool ever. Campground is unpowered, spacious and well-maintained. Basic shower/loo is clean enough with some hot water supply. No laundry or kitchen facilities. Campfires allowed, which is also a plus point. Camp host comes around at evening time collecting fees."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,I visited the campground with my caravan in 2008. Great little walk up to the top of the falls to the plunge pool. Quite exhilarating swimming to the edge and looking down the waterfall to the large swimming lake below!! Very refreshing too!! Spoke to the Ranger. He had to fly in by helicopter to check the area during the January 2008 wet period. Water was 10 metres deep plunging over the falls!! Whole campground was under water. The massive turbulence of water spray from the falls caused some hairy moments for the chopper pilot!!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"the drive in was painful for us because we were on a 2WD. Total regret not renting a 4WD. it would have been much faster. The roads in are unpaved and rough.. Hike up to Gunlom Pool is rocky but not too bad. Just be wary of loose rocks and make sure you have a firm footing. The view is spectacular! If possible, stay till about 5-6pm to watch the sun set slightly from the plunge pool."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The signs said this was 4wd access only. If you grew up in the bush, then this is a very normal road. Biggest problem was the speeding 4wds! Great facilities at the base pool, and a light climb to the top of the falls. Spectacular views from top. Top is a plunge pool, bottom is a massive swimming hole."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Beautiful waterfall, great place to cool down and enjoy the view. Sturdy walk to the top, but well worth it! It has been 5 years ago, but I still remember the beauty of it!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,This place is just magic! The pool at the bottom of the falls as well as the rock pools up top are beautiful and one of the best places in Kakadu
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Gunlom features a pool at the bottom of the waterfall that is accessible for almost anybody. This is a large pool that is deep only a short distance from the edge. Be careful if you or your children cannot swim competently. But it is a great place. The plunge pools are located ABOVE the waterfall. Getting there involves a solid walk/climb up a very steep track and takes 40 minutes or so. The reward is a really refreshing dip in either/both of two pools and a spectacular view out over the wetlands below. (Also crocodiles can't climb up the waterfall so the plunge pools are guaranteed safe 12 months of the year. The lower pool needs to be checked after the end of the wet season each year). You will appreciate another swim in the lower pool by the time you get back to the bottom again. Be aware of the distances involved in visiting Kakadu. Gunlom is some 140 km/80 miles from Jabiru and the side road to access it off the Kakadu Highway is a rough dirt road. It is about an hour from the turnoff to Gunlom - this is not a road where you will be travelling fast.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Swimming hole at base is worth the rough road trip in even if the walk to the top is too much for you - a great way to spend the day! Thoroughly recommend this part of Kakadu so don't miss it just because you think you can't make it to the top for the plunge pools & the views.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"It is a about a 40 - 45 minute walk straight up to these pools - but the view at the top is stunning. The pools at the top were lovely and refreshing and there are some trees for shade.Not for the feint hearted! You do need to be in reasonable condition to climb up. But there is a pool at the bottom (though we saw a freshie on our visit!) for those unable to do the climb. It is a long and very bumpy road in and out to Gunlom, but it is well worth it. It was only us and 3 others at the top. We could have sat in the pools forever, but alas the long trek down (a bit quicker but more hazardous) and the long drive out and to our accommodation meant we had to be on our way earlier than we would have liked. Warning - drink plenty and cover up - I unfortunately ended up with heat stroke despite drinking lots and taking my time."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Went there with Gagudju Dreaming Advanture Tour which is not a regular route. The normal route is to Jim Jim Fall and Twin Falls, but they were not open (is now open!) so we went to Gunlom. It was a bit shame since we couldn't have the chance to see how stunning Jim Jim Fall is but Gunlom sure is another good choice. There are 3 pools in Gunlom, if you are not a fit person you can enjoy the first also the biggest pool under the falls. Or if you think yourself fit enough, you can walk the track and climb up to the other pools on the top. It's not a difficult walk but very steep. The water on top pools are clear like crystal and the view is just luxurious! Remember to enjoy the water flush down from top, like a natural spa. Bring your camera, you wouldn't want to missed this masterpiece!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"What's not to love? First, it's a free attraction, that comes with a fantastic view (if you manage the steep walk) and enjoy a swim in a 100% croc-free pool at the top. So our guide told us that Gunlom is one of the place we can't miss. One reason being the fantastic view from the top and the other that the pool is croc-free. We finally understood why because crocs can't get that far up! The climb was not difficult for those who are physically fit. Challenging for the rest but definitely manageable. Trust us, it is worth every single step and climb up. The view is breath-taking and don't forget to relax by the pool!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom was absolutely amazing! The tough walk to get there was well rewarded with the swim at the end. The walk took us around 40 minutes to complete and I found it quite challenging but I think most people would be able to complete it, just make sure you wear proper walking shoes for this and not thongs/flip flops. The water and views at the top were amazing and a lot less crowded than the pools in Litchdfield."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Be forewarned, this is a 4WD optional road leading to Gunlom, I don't think there's anything optional about it. When we got to Gunlom it was magnificent, the bottom pool was large and very pretty, the entire grounds around the pool were very attractive, it made you want to put your pillow down and stay for the night. Once up the steep climb to the top of Gunlom the view is even more magnificent, really incredible, there are three pools, one of which is a natural infinity pool. This is a never miss!!!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Yes there is a steep 1klm walk up to the pools, but it's worth every minute of it, just take your time and when you get to the top the reward will be yours! The pools were absolutely amazingly beautiful! And so beautiful to swim in! Enjoy!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This was quite a walk to the top if you are an agile person this will take about 30 mins for those not so agile allow around 45 mins. There are lots of rocks to climb to get to the top and the walk down could be quite a challenge. At the top there is a few rock pools to swim in, some people spend a couple of hours up there. One of the pools is like an infinity pool when you are in there it looks like it just runs over the edge. Just stunning."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom is where a scene from the Crocodile Dundee was filmed. Its an absolutely stunning place. The road however can be terrible. The very first time we tried to get there the road was so corrugated we only got about 2 km down the dirt road as it was so bad even in a 4x4. We tried again a year later road was much better, although there were sections of the road that were very rough, although people were driving with cars. Once there however the main Gunlom pool is just stunning. When we were there the water was a nice temperature. If you go above the falls there are more pools and just as stunning. Its hard to capture the beauty of this place, but well worth it."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This place is simply awesome. unfortunately we arrived in the middle of the day and the heat too stifling (early October) to tackle the climb to top pools with kids, but the large bottom pool truly amazing and refreshing. Virtually had the place to ourselves as well. The 40 kms of corrugated dirt road in where worth it."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"It is quite a walk up the rocky incline, but the views and the dip in the ""infinity"" pool that overlooks stunning kakadu landscape, are well worth it. Once you have cooled down and enjoyed the view, take a walk a little further up along the river. The next pool is stunning, a lot deeper and a short swim takes you into an intriguing gorge. This set of pools is my favorite in kakadu. The camp is really nice with hot showers & is very clean."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom Plunge Pools are the most beautiful part of Kaladu Park. They are worth the drive. It takes about 1h30 from Jabiru. The road is good amd suitable for 2WD. Once you get to Gunlom camp site, take a walk up the hill and you will reach the pools in less than 30min. The view over the southern part of Kakadu Park is breatktaking and the pools are natural infinity pools. If you can, stay the whole day and observe tbe sunset."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Campsite is large, fire places provided, byo wood. Ablution block is large with approx 10 showers & toilets. Recommend take your own toilet paper as it runs out every night. The information evening is excellent, where the ranger sets up a slideshow educating you on aboriginal culture & bush tucker. We didn't go to the pool at the base of the falls and chose to climb up to the top to watch the sunset and again the next day to swim and explore for most of the day. The water is cool and the view from the natural infinity pool is spectacular. The best part is the climb to the top only takes 20mins and is easy enough for small children. A great place to visit."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,First day in Kakadu - scared to death of crocs but the beauty of this place seems to calm you down so even I swam in the pool. The trek to the top was active but the rock pools at the top and the view was amazing. Beautiful place and only after descending did we notice the croc cage and pictures of the salties caught there before. I hope mainly in the wet season because they looked really mean.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The pools at the top of the falls are lovely - swimming with a view. There is a shallower pool away from the clifftop suitable for smaller children. and they - the ones at the top of the falls - are all above crocodile level
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,What a place! We are so lucky to have been able to visit this place. I had a 1yr old in a backpack walking up the steep climb but it was so worth it. Really enjoyed the swim. Lovely grassy area for picnic at the bottom. Definitely worth a visit
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"We stopped here on a tip and it was so worth it!! Yes the last 7 or so km of unsealed roads have corrugations and rocks, but we saw two wheel drives with reasonable clearance get through - just take it easy and you will be rewarded at the end!! The pool at the bottom is great, but the pools up the top are even better with an incredible view!! The walk is steep and rocky but not that long. I am not the fittest person and made it no problems. This was a trip highlight for me."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The walk up the cliff sucks but it is very much worth it when you get to the top! Clean beautiful water and no crocs!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"It is worth the hike up to the top of the falls, the view while swimming in the plunge pool was unlike anything I had seen before. The water was so clear and refreshing! It really is mother nature and its best. Next time I'm up that way, will definitely visit again! Try and get there early to avoid the crowds."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Had been walking most of the morning at Yurmikmik. We then drove to Gunlom for a dip in the billabong. Had a refreshing dip there and we could see people at the top of the falls. Mum and dad wanted to go up for a look but 2 teenagers didn't. So mum and dad made them! We got to the top and...WOW...how spectacular was it! Great views for miles and then 5 different pools and 2 waterfalls to swim in/under. Even the teenagers were happy they had made the effort to go up the 1km hard track. ended up spending 3 hours just in the these pools soaking up the sun and the splendour!
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom Falls is beautiful. No crocodiles so its safe to swim. Plunge pools at the bottom of the falls are great for swimming but make sure you do the hike to the top, the views are awesome :)"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Went to the top plunge pools at Gunlom Falls during my 5 day Kakadu Tour, and this has to be one of my fave spots! Its just gorgeous and serene, with wonderful views of the valley. Not all the plunge pools are too deep to stand in, which is great, as you don't have to constantly tread water. The waterfall running from the top of the mountain, and then through the plunge pools to the big waterfall running of the side is awesome. It's quite a rugged climb to the top, and can be quite a lot if you don't have good knees for example. But its worth it once you make it to the top. A must see!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Great visit here. Most people were at the top. It is a hike but well worth it. The road in is a long 4wd.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Planned a quick visit and stayed for over 3 hours as the views were amazing, the pools are magical and the climb was tough but worth it!!!"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Gunlom is always a welcome reprieve from the dry stone country of the Mary river district. The drive in may seem like a long journey but rest assured that the plunge pool that is the attraction of this site make the corrugations worth every bump.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The 35km dirt road does its best to put you off but it is worth the effort. The rock pool at Gunlom is spectacular with beautiful clean cool water and no crocodiles!! The pool is surrounded by steep cliffs and would normally have a waterfall (not flowing when we were there).
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"The walk up to the top of the water fall is steep, however take a few breaks and make sure you make it to the top the view and swim is worth it. The water is crystal clear and it is still flowing, just! The water temperature is beautiful with a number of pools you can swim in. This time of the year you can have the place to yourself, we did! What a treat. The view is also a bonus. If you don't walk to the top of the falls the bottom pool is a great stop for a swim and is so pretty. Great camping grounds with toilets and solar showers. You can also have a camp fire. The bottom pool is also the pool in the Crocodile Dundee Movie where he spears the Barramundi and gives Linda a kiss! Please note you have 37 km of dirt road, much is corrugated so prepare to get rattled."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Yes the drive on the dirt road on the way was bumpy but there were cars doing it no problems. Once you are there it is amazing. The pool at the bottom was beautiful but the rockpools at the top were heaven. The walk up was steep but you are rewarded when you get to the top. The pools are crystal clear, not too deep or cold. Tip- pack your lunch and spend the day up here. The view are amazing and this was as good or better than the other natural attractions in the NT"
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,'Gunlom' is not easy to get to but is well worth the effort. It is maybe a three and a half hour drive from darwin with the last 30kms being on a corrugated dirt road. But the pool at the bottom of the falls is amazing. And cold! A climb to the top of the falls is a 'must' and the rock pools there combined with the view from the escarpment will stay with you for a long time. Magical place. Camping is good there as well.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This walk is rated severe. It is basically 500m straight up the side of a cliff and by half way up I was considering walking down lol. I am glad I didn't because at the end of this walk you are rewarded with the most spectacular site I have ever seen. An oasis ontop of a waterfall, Gunlom has 3 crystal clear plunge pools that then cascade over a waterfall to the lower pool. We were fortunate enough to see a water monitor sunning itself on the rock and dipping into the water to catch a fish, which are in abundance. We stayed the night at the campground and even got to listen to a free slide show of how the traditional owners make use of the land. The corrugated road is well worth the trip to this beautiful spot."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,This waterfall is not visited by as many people probably because a 4WD is recommended for the drive there. Anyway the water pool at the bottom of the waterfalls was great and had an amazing green colour. Quite spectacular. The climb to the top of the waterfalls is short but steep in places. At the top several rock pools await you which are amazing. You can look over the top of the falls and see the the savannah etc. Great view. Would highly recommend to all.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"After 39 kilometres of corrugations that even a 2 WD could manage, we were rewarded with a beautiful, shaded park area with a spectacular pool at the bottom of a waterfall but, the magic is a one kilometre strenuous walk to the top of the waterfall. It's not as hard as it looks - I'm 62. At the top is a panoramic view and a serious of four pools each one cascading into the next until the water flows into the pool at the bottom of the fall. The water is clear and warmer than the icy water in the bottom plunge pool. It's well worth the climb."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The plunge pool is amazing. The water is so cool and refreshing from the hot sun and most of the pool lies in shadow throughout the day. The waterfall was trickling away and probably looks more spectacular during the wet season but that did not spoil the scenery! There is a lovely picnic/bbq area nearby and we were sorry we did not bring any sausages to cook! The only thing to remember is that driving there you have to drive between 50 - 80 km/hr over the unsealed roads otherwise if you slow down it's a bumpy ride! You don't need a 4WD to get here but you need some good driving skills.
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"It was just about the clearest, most beautiful, peaceful place I've ever been. amazing in the rock pools, and at the bottom."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"waterfall, scenery, landscape - just beautiful in the dry season."
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"My visit was well over 2 years ago. I would willingly pay the 25 dollar entry fee for the entry to all the wonderful attractions in Kakadu . My children loved the swimming available in the park and the accommodation we stayed in. Plan your attractions itinerary so you get to spend time in all key areas......Warradjan, Bowlai, Ubirr Jim Jim, Twin falls...........plan your itinerary based on National Parks information. Stunningly refreshing. You fell special and unique as it is such an isolated attraction. I wish more tourists would visit!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Easy walk from the carpark. Really refreshing swim. Great to see so many families enjoying themselves. Very pretty gorge.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Beautiful place water cool the bottom is a little bit rough in places if you go for a swim not too crowded only three groups there. Did not do any walks as too hot this time of year and day. Family have done several previous certainly worth the trouble if it’s cooler.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We did the circuit from Alice Springs to Hermannsburg and came back via Namatjira Drive. We enjoyed a stop here and did the walk to the lookout. You can swim but it looked very cold and people were not staying in long. You need a $10 pass if you don’t live in NT. They have toilets and a kiosk.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"I visited this attraction on one day tour to West McDonnelll ranges tour , it's cool place for getting relaxed by sitting on sand beach or swimming in freshwater big water hole.there are also other acitivities. such as, walking trail (red gum tree trail), section of larapinta trail . there are facilities for emergency phone call, toilets, souvenir shops, snack shops ,bar and cafe and also ice cream for purchasing ."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Sign posted turn off and sealed road into parking area. Kiosk, toilets. Easy, flat, paved path into the gorge. Can walk along sandy creek bed or further along path until you reach the sand. Plenty of space on the sand to sit, can be well shaded depending on the time of day. When walking into the water down the far end, it gets deep quite quickly, shallow water closer to the path. Water is very cold so I suggest a pool noodle or inflatable to lie on. Can swim under the rocky, cave section which has amazing acoustics."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"You have 2 choices to see the Gorge. One is the high road and the other is the low road. The low road is a fairly flat and easy walk to a beach at the swimming hole in the gorge. The high road climbs up to a lookout at the top of the gorge's rim which both looks down the length of the gorge as well as on the swimming hole directly beneath. It is a long and steady mostly flat but always inclining path to the top. If you have the time, you can take the high road and then return to the low road to cool off in the water hole. The actual gorge is not all that impressive if your expectation of a gorge is tall vertical walls spaced closely together. Ormiston is not like that, being more of a valley between widely separated cliffs. The waterhole is said to be devoid of crocs, but they once said that about Wangi (see separate review) before one was captured there after an attack. So exercise caution!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A magnificent gorge of winding cliffs with a wonderful sunset lighting up the rocks. Walk up to the Ghost Gum Lookout and beyond for great views of the waterhole from above - a spectacular setting for a cool dip at any time of the day.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The kiosk was great. Fantastic coffee amazing staff and beautiful products and artwork. The gorge, itself, is spectacular. Amazing place for families to gather."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Beautiful and tranquil Orminston Gorge is so easy to access and enjoy just off the main highway. Paved walkways make this once remote site doable for disabled access. Such a precious sight for all Australians and international visitors and families and a cool swim also.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We started the Ormiston Pound Walk early to beat the heat. The scenery was spectacular with the highlight having to make two unprepared swimming crossings. The last two kilometres are very rocky which included lots of scrambling and concentration to ensure we didn’t lose our footing. The walk/swim took approximately 2 and a half hours. We enjoyed a nice coffee and muffin from the cafe to finish off a lovely morning.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Looks amazing, but beware of the time you visit, it smelt like dead fish In August. A natural event for the time of year that I wasn't aware of until our tour guide mentioned it on the drive there. Swimming is allowed but no one wanted to swim with the dead fish and the smell."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,What a beautiful place to spend some time. Go for a long walk- assuming the rivers not flooded like it was for us to do the full circuit. However the shorter version just up and around the river bend before scaling a rocky face to walk along to see the lookout was a wonderful way to see the Gorge. Best time is early in the morning to avoid the heat and also to see the still waters and photograph them before everyone else surfaces!!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We stayed two nights in the camp ground. WOW, a swim in the gorge is so relaxing. The camp ground had hot showers and toilets. The date scones from the kiosk were amazing as was the coffee. Put this place on your bucket list."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The first gorge in the drive from Kings Canyon to Alice Spring or the last one other way around, however, probably the most visited one. Not only it is scenic but there are a quite a good no of nature trails nearby of various difficulties and length"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The last of the big scenic destinations that is accessible in the West MacDonnell ranges from Alice. When we arrived the car parks although many were really full so expect big crowds here. There is a small cafe and plenty of toilet facilities. The Gorge itself is spectacular and very beautiful. One of the most scenic in the area but bear in mind that the crowds are also large so don't expect tranquil serene conditions. Bring your swimming gear as there is plenty of water to swim in and cool down on hot days. There are also several trails to do, some requiring a certain level of fitness, but the walk along the dry river bed section is easy and stunning to say the least. Look up in the surrounding cliff faces at the amazing ghost gums clinging miraculously to the rock walls."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We visited in a small group of 8 travellers with a minibus. There was a kiosk with coffee and food, clean flushing toilets, picnic tables, and walking tracks up to the lookout and the waterhole. A lovely place for a walk and maybe a swim!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Ormiston Gorge is a great example of Australian red-centre scenery and a must go to place if in the West MacDonnel Ranges. It is a short walk from the car park and easy access. One downer however was the poorly maintained toilets--not good enough for an important tourist stop and resulted in one less point in the rating.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Well worth the stop. We didn't stop for long as we were doing a day trip from Alice Springs along the tourist drive. Hubby and the kids had a swim in the gorge. I sat back laughing as they were all freezing. As it was late October and the kids were wearing wetsuits this was quite amusing. So yes, the water is definitely on the cool side! This and Ellery are definitely the pick of the gorges. If you have to skip one, I'd probably make it Glen Helen."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"If you are prepared to get wet, there are some good walks here. Found the country amazing. Camped here one night. Limited showers but you would have little trouble finding a spot with overflow into a large parking area. Clean and well managed. Have a small kiosk. Mixture of hikers, day trippers and over nighters."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This was my pick of the 3 gorges we visited with Ellery coming in second and Glen Helen I wouldn’t recommend. Ormiston was an easy walk in, you can get to both sides of the gorge. There was also an option to climb up the Great Ghost trail which I didn’t do but the view would be amazing. You can swim here although it might be a little cool. Great views and birdlife, a few fish in the water. There is also a café serving light meals and tea/coffee. Highly recommend the Gorge."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A highlight walk all round, but watch out for the water levels, as river crossings likely. The warmer the day, the more water that should be carried."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The parking was plentiful, clean, tidy and well signed. The cafe was a welcome sight and it was good to see so much water in the gorge with so many visitors after such a difficult 2020. The gardens and walk way were very well kept and easy to access for everyone. So many floating flamingoes."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"There are several walks of different intensity available, ranging from a simple stroll along the bit of the creek bed near the car park to the Ormiston Pound Loop Walk (3-4 hours) which ends up coming back through the Gorge along the creek bed. We chose the Ghost Gum Walk which is well signed and has plenty of explanatory signboards. The first part along a well made path up to the lookout gives you stunning views of the gorge from above. From there you descend to the creek bed and walk along the creek bed giving a completely different perspective of the gorge. There are two boulder piles on the creek bed between where the made track ends and the waterhole near the car park which are a bit difficult to navigate."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"I have not been to Ormiston Gorge for quite some time and I cannot believe the transformation. Walking tracks are excellent and the ghost gum walk is an absolute must. Other than the most beautiful natural beauty, the facilities are fantastic. Camping, barbecues, beautifully clean amenities and a kiosk. Signage is excellent and a huge thank you to the rangers who do a magnificent job. Highly recommend."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A must see on the West Mac drive either on a day tour or going to and from Kings Canyon. Too cold to swim this time and also not enough water due to the drought.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Did the western MacDonald range day trip and Ormiston Gorge was the best part of the day where we could swim and cool off, the March flies were horrendous and we all got bitten quite badly, even after dousing ourselves with repellant, swimmers beware ok in the he water but once you get out the flies are waiting, needed to take anti histamines to stop he itching and apply tea tree oil on the bites."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,An awe-inspiring area which we walked across whilst on the Larapinta Trail. The colours of the cliffs of the gorge and the expanse of the pound took my breath away.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"It’s about 8 km drive in from the highway and you will find a great car park area with toilets, ranger/info centre, bbq, picnic areas. The hike is not easy as you are climbing up to the lookouts. Good footwear and fitness necessary. We walked from the water back across the sand rather than back tracking which was a lot easier. It was about 2 km return."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Went by here on a one day MacDonnel Ranges tour. Probably my favourite stop. Wonderful view over the gorge, and a refreshing swim in the water hole. Wish I could spend more time here."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"There is a sealed access road from Namatjira Drive to the day use parking area: nearby is a small camping area which in peak times is horribly crowded and probably worth avoiding. There is a kiosk here providing some basic refreshments and plenty of local park information. We opted to do the Pound walk: truly spectacular: about 7km and 3-4 hour to complete: the last km or so, if you go anti-clockwise (I would recommend this) is a bit of a rock scramble through the gorge itself but well worth it. Waterholes were only found at the end of the gorge which can be easily accessed from the day-use area for those not wanting a more strenuous walk. However, this was probably my favourite day walk in the Red Centre and I think well worth the effort. Amazing rock colours in the gorge. Some interesting birdlife around the waterholes plus some hardier types taking a plunge in the cold waters. Quite a few people in this area which detracts a little from the overall experience but it is a popular spot for a reason."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Great place to visit with all the history about well laid out paved all the way good water hole to swim in and plenty seating areas
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,November 2019 is in a drought and the water level is so low! Usual steps into the water steps onto deep dry sand and a wee walk to get to the waterhole. Clean water with lots of wee fish to keep the birds well fed.Shame kiosk closed-need to take signs down!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Easy walk to the gorge from the carpark as well as some short and easy hikes to the lookout. Start early in hot weather as the top of the gorge is quite exposed. Water was cold but refreshing and kids loved jumping into the deep water from the rocks and from the sandy bank. The kiosk at the carpark makes excellent barista coffee and even served freshly baked scones on the day we were there! Plenty of shady spots to set up even during the busyness of school holidays. Wish we had more time to spend here.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Lovely walk through the gorge. The track is easy to follow and not too difficult. Quite a lot of steps, but very manageable. Don’t go when it’s really hot."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Ormiston Gorge is a beautiful place to stop for lunch or a cup of tea or coffee while travelling through the West MacDonald Ranges. It is an easy walk to the waterhole from the carpark. The waterhole at the end of the short walk is a very beautiful photo opportunity - not to be missed ! There is also a walk to a lookout overlooking the gorge.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The whole of the West MacDonnell ranges are remarkable in their beauty. The Larapinta trail, an item on my to do list stretches for 223kms along the range. Camping at Ormiston Gorge allowed me to sample just a little bit of it. The campsite is quite large and was very busy due to school holidays but had good toilets and showers and a cafe with yummie coffee, run by a lovely young couple. Sadly because of a lightning storm which led to fires; across the landscape can be seen desolate parched land which is slowly regenerating. However, the views are still quite beautiful in particular around the Gorges. We also stopped at Ellery Big Hole for a view but the campsite there was full. It’s recommend you book well in advance at peak times. Immerse yourself if the West MacDonnell ranges. You won’t regret it. Absolutely gorgeous."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"There is so much to enjoy at this stop, a great walk, a super gorge with a wet area, wallabies on the cliff face and reasonable bird numbers too. The little cafe at the car park is worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Took us 3 hours to do the 10km walk. There is not much shade so be prepared - best not to do in middle of day if hot. It is a great walk with some good scenery and ends walking through the rocks and gums in the gorge. There is a nice kiosk/cafe to visit at the end of the walk.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We arrived about 4.00pm and got one of the last spots to stay overnight in our motorhome. $10 a night per person and it has hot showers. A great place to stay and enjoy the peaceful scenic rugged outback. The gorge and water hole is good, and really enjoyed the short Ghost Gum walk which has a good lookout. It also has a nice kiosk for a morning/afternoon coffee. Next morning we did the 10km Ormiston Pound walk which was great."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We spent a couple of hours at the cafe and surrounds during a recent Larapinta Trail hike. We lunched at the cafe, which was very good — service excellent, good food, clean facilities. Beautiful surroundings!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A really beautiful place within 2 hours drive from Alice. They even have a cafe here, so you can actually sit down and have a cuppa or snack. The walking trail are the Sections 9 and 10 of the 223 km Larapinta Trail."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Very beautiful. The day was very hot but worth it. All the gorges in this area stunningit. We went out in a sedan no off road vehicle easy
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,By far my favourite Gorge out of the lot along the MacDonnell Ranges. We did the 2.5km walk/hike in our flip flops and sandles and it was beautiful. The end of the hike is where the big water hole is and we went for a very short dip as it was over 30 degrees and we were hot and sweaty from the walk although the water was extremely cold. Also purchased a nice cold bottle of water from the little shop before returning to the car.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We visited this beautiful spot as part of the Emu Run one day tour. So worth visiting. We had no idea there were waterholes like these in such a dry area. An amazing oasis.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,What a lovely spot could have spent all day here but had so much more to see in this area. Great spot to cool off.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,What can one say about such a beautiful place. You just have to go see for yourself.......take your time and just listen to the silence.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"135km out of Alice Springs on a sealed rd suitable for a 2WD car and only a 400m easy flat walk from the car park with some good shade. The water was cold but others had been swimming there. You can also do a 35 min return walk to the ghost gum lookout. There is a section of steep stairs before you get a great view of the gorge and pound. There is also a longer walk I did not do. Free bbq, tables, camping area, heaps parking for caravans and even a kiosk"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge was our favourite of all the gorges we visited (nearby Glen Helen Gorge is a close second). There is a short walk, a mid walk, a long walk. Do any walk and it will not disappoint you. This is such a beautiful and stunning place and it's HUGE. After your walk, go to the kiosk, for a drink, an ice cream, a snack, etc. It's run by the most welcoming people. Finding the gorge and parking is easy. Oh, bring your fly net - there are plenty of flies!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We spent a day relaxing at Ormiston Gorge after walking the Larapinta Trail. The Gorge had low water but the camp grounds, cafe and surrounds were lovely. The camp dingo was very friendly and cheeky - make sure food is locked away!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The area is really well set up for walkers and for people just wanting a gentle stroll. The cafe was really good and the new managers are doing all they can to expand the menu and services available.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We did an 8km walk resulting in a walk down the gorge over some quite difficult boulders. The geology here is great but on the broader walk there were good wild flowers and trees, the fires had not been so damaging here. The water hole is very impressive and completing the longer walk well worthwhile."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Definitely one not to miss. Heaps of parking and also a kiosk... how good is that. Nice little walk from the car park to the water were you can enjoy a swim to cool off. Another great place to stop along the West Macs.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,What a find. This beautiful waterhole hidden in the semi arid region of central Australia.... sit and relax in the cool water hole.....whether you just dip your toes or have a swimm this place is pure heaven. Sit and enjoy the noises aof the bush and sometimes you'll see local wildlife too. The acoustics here are amazing also. Usually once a year there is a musical recital for all to enjoy
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"seen this little place as part of day tour, def worth a look as quiet well hidden little place of paradise"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Receiving high reviews, which is highly deserved. Clearly the pick of the gorges around Alice Springs. Not to be missed."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Beautiful spot for a quick swim and spend a lazy few hours admiring the scenery for the bottom of the cliffs to the top of the cliffs
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This was a beautiful spot. Water was too chilly to swim but well worth the visit... Great tour guide.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We loved our experience here at Ormiston Gorge even though the fires had gone through it was still a beautiful walk we did the Ghost Gum lookout and walked down through the river bed it was beautiful the colours in the rocks are gorgeous. We also had a coffee and cake at the little cafe the new owners were lovely so I recommend you have a coffee there
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Well worth seeing. You can either walk up to the Ghost Gum Lookout for a spectacular view of the ranges and gorge or you can take a leisurely stroll down to the the Waterhole and admire the rock formations up close. Either way, you won't be disappointed with the beauty and serenity of this beautiful countryside. I guess it would be a nice place to swim on a hot day."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The West MacDonnell Ranges stretch west from Alice Springs and it is easy to spend a full one or two days visiting some or all of the locations along the way. The main road is sealed so access in a 2WD hire car is easy. Ormiston Gorge is one of our favourite locations. The longer Loop Walk gives fabulous views. It is rough and uneven in places so boots or sturdy walking shoes are necessary. For those without the time or inclination, the shorter walk into the gorge is lovely and shows off the trees and the gorgeous rock formations and colours. It is possible to take a dip in the pool, but be aware that it can be very cold in the cooler months. In winter the flies can be a nuisance but a flynet keeps them off your face. We were surprised to find a small kiosk/cafe there so enjoyed a quick morning tea. Walkers on the Larapinta Trail were enjoying a treat there too. It's a good spot to be picked up/dropped off if just walking sections of the Trail. Facilities at Ormiston Gorge include toilets and overnight camping."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This is another place that you find on your trip to MacDonnell Ranges. This is a great place to swim in summer but currently because of the algae in the water, just keep out..."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,My sister and i had a really good tour and trip in and around the centre of australia. It was an awesome experience.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Great walk. Takes 3 hours with very little shade. Make sure you take plenty of water. Well worth the effort.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The natural beauty is always here even when the flies are numerous. We enjoyed a picnic lunch on the sand.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The amazing colours of the centre are truely resplendent at Ormiston Gorge. Worth the trip at anyu time, I would imagine."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The red, white and blue of the Australian outback at its best can be seen in Ormiston Gorge. A short walk with your hat fly net and camera will be well worth the effort. You wont be disappointed with this naturally beautiful environment. Sit back and relax while you take in your surroundings. Look out for the wildlife and enjoy the tranquility."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This part of the Red Centre trip is an area not to be missed....the scenery is unlike any you will see elsewhere in Australia, and very beautiful."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The Ormiston Pound Walk, around 9km and 3-4 hours, is considered one of Australia's best day walks. While parts are presently fire ravaged, the surrounding mountains and views of the pound are captivating. As you get back towards the gorge along the dry riverbed, the cliffs produce a spectacular red gorge. Along the route are highpoints and a 100m detour to a lookout that offers wonderful views of this remarkable formation. Before getting back to the swimming hole and carpark, detour via the Ghost Gum Walk for even more great gorge views. If pressed for time, it is an easy 200m walk from the carpark to swimming hole, which is a nice spot to picnic, and you can also easily add the walk to the Ghost Gums lookout. Doing the full walk allows you to not miss out on what was created by huge geological shifts 2 billion years old and flooding over many thousands of years. Cafe and toilets are here to make it a comfortable stopping point. Well worth the 90 minute drive from Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Australia has the most beautiful places everyone should try and see them. Very peaceful and most tranquil place to just sit and admire
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"It seems all other reviewers only went to the swimming hole. We walked the Pound Trail, 7 kms, called ‘moderate’, in about 4 hours. At the start, most of the area had been burnt so it was rather cleared but fascinating to see the new shoots coming up amidst the destruction. The trail was well marked up and over some hills for the first half or so. Then we hit the dry riverbed. We lost the trail here and had to scramble over some very hefty boulders. It was difficult and scary. We found the trail again and trudged on. Here the landscape changed a lot between climbing more boulders to sandy flatlands. Coming round to the gorge, i can say was pretty spectacular. Again, however, we had to navigate over boulders that at least for me got a bit scary. Those who only take the easy pathway to the swimming hole clearly miss out on the beauty of the area beyond it. Consider that I’m 64, not very fit, and scared of heights as you read this. Regardless, i could do it and I’m glad i did. My advice? Take the easy trail to the swimming hole and walk beyond through the gorge for about 2-3 kms. Then just go back. Maybe after the shrubs grow back the first half would be nicer."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Must admit both my wife and I felt that the Glen Helen Gorge was better, the walk to the waterhole was quite good but didn’t go further as two people in their seventies we could not have scrambled over all the rocks. The lookout looked good but my wife was struggling so we didn’t go up there."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"On a day tour with Emu Tours and this was part of the tour. On arrival we were told you could take a hike up to view the gorge and take a swim in the cool waters. I didn't do the hike as I was chomping at the bit to take a dip. The walk to the gorge is an easy stroll and there is a sandy beach area surrounding the iridescent green water.Yes the water was icy and invigorating but well worth it. Loved the place, so peaceful and relaxing. As a bonus there are toilets and change rooms."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We only were day trippers this time but we seriously are considering coming back here with our caravan one day. Great swimming hole and plenty of hikes available.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"I would definitely recommend a visit to Ormiston Gorge. The gorge is like a picture postcard, the beautiful colours of the rocks and the contrasting sand. The only negative for me was that the water was absolutely freezing! (October) October 2017"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We visited this spot and were most impressed by the spectacular scenery around the area .Time did'nt allow us to complete one of the walks around he Gorge but they did look very inviting. A swim in warm weather would have been most refreshing !
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge is the jewel in the crown of the region. Easily accessible by 2WD from Alice Springs and an easy day trip with stops along the way. The gorge is always full of water and is very deep in the middle. Wildlife abounds including dingoes, There are electric BBQs and picnic spots with tables and the birdlife is amazing. I have lived in the NT fo 25 years and Ormiston Gorge is my number one spot."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Visited the Ormiston Gorge as part of the West McDonnell tour by Emu Run Experience. Stunning rocks and nice water hole for a quick dip, but water was quite cold. No crocodiles but so interesting."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge has a nice waterhole where fellow travellers said swimming was fine. Because of the prolonged drought, water levels were low but still more than adequate for swimming. There is a cafe there too with all the basic necessities."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A magnificent place. Amazingly beautiful and peaceful. Water was cold in September but clear and some on the tour did take a dip. Very restful just to stick your feet in from the sandy shore and look at the rocks.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Clean, pretty good food, friendly staff. Had a small issue when previous client's fuel was left on bowser and added to my bill. Staff were understanding and probably fixed it my favor. Things are a bit expensive but that's the outback"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Stopped by on our circuit. It was attractive on a searingly hot day, though not enticing enough for a dip nor for a climb to the lookout."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"It is only 135 k's west of Alice and well worth the drive, we went on a 41C day and after the walk from the carpark to the lake we definitely enjoyed having a swim in the cool water."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Loved this swimming hole. Such a beautiful spot for a refreshing swim and only a short walk on an easy access pathway from the carpark.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We often do a day trip here as it is close to town (Alice Springs) and usually has lots of water. Good for a day trip and picnic or the campground is quite a good one as well. There are a couple of excellent walks to do as well but make sure you do them early morning and take water with you
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We had Ormiston Gorge to ourselves. The stones on the walk were picked up to skip on the water in the Gorge. One person was able to get their stone to skip several times. The Gorge was a very nice example of the Australian outback.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Stasting 10:30 we did the Ormiston Gorge Pound walk, and we weren't disappointed. The 7 km walk takes you through many types of terrains from grassed areas to little rock pools. At ,the end you come to the large pool where you can cool down. Only a word of warning you must start early as it does get hot already around 12:00pm,and take plenty of water to drink."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"One of the loveliest sights on the West McDonnell Ranges. You can take a dip in the water however it is so peaceful just to sit and look at the scenery. We walked around the gorge on a well maintained path, a little steep in places but well worth the effort. This walk requires two to three hours to complete."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Great walk but a bit rocky so be aware if you are a bit unstable on your feet. We walked along the bottom then came back along the ridge. I think this works well as once you have done the climb upwards its just an easy stroll back. Just consider the time of day and all that as you might want to do it in reverse to avoid too much heat/sun on the ridge. Another tip, ask where you need to climb upwards as its not that obvious. We had too."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Local taxi driver took us there plus other places of interest a more personal service a good way to see moire than on an official tour
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We went for a hike up to a ghost gum tree and got fantastic views of swimmers in the gorge waterhole.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"On a warm October day we took the short walk to the Gorge and loved every minute. As we are in the dry the water levels were low but for the few souls there, plenty to go around. The different colours of the rock strata and the ghost gums growing on the rocky edges makes for a beaut scene. The water was cool & inviting and the sandy each area a good sun baking spot !"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,One of the nione stops done on a 9.5hr tour to West MasDonnel Ranges. A special location - very photogenic - and welcome spot on a hot day. Red Centre attraction and worth a stop too rest and enjoy nature's tranquility and colours.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,From the parking area this is ony s short walk. The swimming hole has in the dry season a nice sandy beach. Near teh rock the water is deep which causes that the water is pritty cool.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This is a must do in the West MacDonnell National Park. It is a short walk from the parking lot to the lake. Around the small lake are some beaches and on one side high red rocks. The water was cool but not to cold to go in. We did saw Australasian Darter, Crested Pigeons, Australasian Grebes and two Whistling Kites. On the other side of the lake I did walk over the rocks into the gorge. The Ormiston creek was almost gone after 6 months of no rain. That part of the gorge did had the best views. (I did not do the Ghost Gum Walk). We did eat at the kiosk by the parking lot. They did serve a good lunch. We did spend 3 hours here."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This is one of the most popular attractions in the West MacDonnell NP. Spectacular swimming hole. The colours of the gorge walls are amazing. Nice cafe close by to enjoy an ice cream after your visit.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,a great place to go for a swim with family/have picnic definitely advise it other people looking to travel
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Visited on a hot day and took the steps to the Gumtree and back via the gorge floor. The views were amazing and the water good enough to swim in.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Travelling and experiencing these remote gorges in mid to late October is a bit warm but the benefit is - there is no-one here. We had the whole place to ourselves - amazing. The scenery was stunning with red gorge walls, ghost gums and clear blue sky"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,What an end to a magnificent drive. Went to Glen Helen for a quick bite then back for a quick dip to cool down. Recommend this over Ellery Creek.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"So easy to find amazing sites and sights along the West MacDonnell Ranges, and this is no exception. Has a swimming hole for those who are keen and plenty of picnic areas if you come prepared. A walk around the edge leads to the gorge proper and more great views."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,It is a beautiful spot for a refreshing swim. The water is clear and fresh and I felt safe swimming there.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Ormiston Gorge is one of the furthest Gorges from Alice Springs but not to be missed. It is just a short walk in from the carpark with a lovely waterhole where you can take a refreshing swim but the water is very cold. Camping is available and there is a kiosk.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A lovely gorge to visit with a local carpark. Don't just walk to the gorge, but follow the signs and take the gorge path taking you above the gorge, seeing all around for miles! The walk into the gorge is short and easy for those who do not feel the need to go too far."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"I went with the family. The grandkids swam in the waterhole while some of us did the walk. I have been many times before and always think it is a great place to visit. Unfortunately it is becoming very busy and is losing some of its atmosphere. A great place to visit in a quiet time, probably in the winter."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Such an amazing experience, the water was incredible. Great facilities and has plenty to offer. A few flies though haha"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Absolutely a must do if you are in the area. We did the medium distance walk (about 1 hour) around the gorge and of course we stopped for a swim in the water holed: we loved it!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Take some time to explore this beautiful gorge and have a swim if you can. Access is easy and there are facilities for a stop and refresh.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"About an hour's drive from Alice. We did Glen Helen, then back to Ormiston for a swim and some lunch, a look at the Ochre Pits and Standley Chasm on the way back. A terrific day. Take your swimmers and a towel, its cold water but a real experience."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We did all the gorges in one day. Ormiston is nearly the furthest. Its a small walk in on a pathway then onto sand. There were a couple of people swimming the day we were there, but the water was really cold. There are rocks at the end for the adventurous to climb over. There were a few wild birds swimming around in the pool and when we walked out there was a goanna on the pathway just ambling along. Very pretty area."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We only had a couple of hours here but it was worth every minute. Lunch in the picnic area near the carpark showed us the contrast between desert wilderness and the well watered gorge areas. The walk to the gorge via the lookout showed us that we need to return to this place to do more at another time.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The magnificent West McDonell Ranges offers a variety of beautiful locations on reasonably close drives from Alice Springs. It is hard to believe when you experience the dryness of the red centre that you can come across such beautiful locations. Ormiston Gorge is the local swimming hole for the locals and even though it is a fair drive from town it is worth the effort. The beautiful red edifices and the stark greenness of the flora of the area make these must see destinations. We had a 12 hour tour run by the Emu Run Experience which takes in a number of these locations which bring to life the Albert Namatjira watercolours.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Worth the drive from Alice, make sure you take your cossies. The colours are truly unbelievable, so beautiful."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We visited Ormiston Gorge several times during our hikes on the Larapinta Trail. It is a beautiful oasis in this red, parched landscape. Watch for the variety of birds, especially in the evening as light disappears."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We visited Ormiston Gorge as part of our trip to the West Macdonnell Ranges. The rich colours and natural beauty of the Gorge is a sight to behold as is the surrounding countryside. There are so many places to visit in the area that are as equally breathtaking. But if you are limited for time I would suggest that Ormiston Gorge be the one to see. Deep Reds of rock face, natural rock art created millions of years past, deep yellow and cream ochres...it is never ending. We swim a lot back home and are used to cold water - BUT...the water in the gorge was very very cold (September 2018). Be careful!! PS It is more than just a place to stop for a Yummy homemade slice"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,One of my favourites of Larapinta trail. Easy walk to its wall. Walkways for challenged mobility. Don't miss it.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,One of the most picturesque places to be found between Alice Springs and Glen Helen Gorge drive. Aahhh the Serenity with the colours of the outback and the shimmer of the cool water soothing your soul. Well worth the easy short walk along the paved path. The coffee and food is excellent at the cafe and camping is allowed...
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We did all the gorges & found this and Serpentine to be our favourites. There was a loop walk to a look out above gorge which had lots steps and rock negotiating once on river base but offrred some great views. All well set out with good signage
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The Ormiston Pound Walk is about 9km & finishes in the Gorge. It is absolutely beautiful & the finish coming through the Gorge quite spectacular. Our favourite of our Alice explorationa & well worth the drive. Great lunch at the kiosk afterwards too
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Before we went down to the Gorge we could not walk past the aroma of coffee and sign saying chocolate and raspberry slice, Both got big ticks especially when told that the slice was made by the lovely gentleman taking our orders this morning"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We really enjoyed this hike. The views were absolutely gorgeous but you got to work for them as there 2-3k/1 mile of just huge rocks/boulders so be prepared.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This was one of my favourite stops in the Western Ranges. Even though it was definitely NOT warm enough to go swimming (July), it was a great place to sit by the water's edge and just take it all in. Make sure you wander farther back around the corner so for really fun rock formations!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Make the effort and take the walk into the gorge. The rocks are awesome the bird life exquisite. There is water available and the kiosk serves food and coffee. Camping available too
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Always beautiful, no matter how much water is in the gorge, this time the waterholes were quite separate. This time we camped, and found the facilities clean and tidy, with plenty of shade, vegetation and birdlife around to make it attractive and keep the dust down. I loved the recycling efforts. The camping and the dayuse areas are separate enough to keep the camping private. I would have loved to stay longer. Note, the surface on the gas hotplates is uneven so doesn't make good contact with kettles - we gave up and used our own cooker instead."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"just one of the highlights of the Larapinta Trail, several great day walks start here, the coffee is really good too."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The Ormiston Gorge hike, is a good walk (hike) for those with limited time in the West Macdonnells, with spectacular views. It is around 9 Kms in length, and is graded moderate. This should take , on average about 3-4 hours to complete. BUT, check conditions in the gorge itself as you may be required to wade or swim , if there has been rain. Our best advice is not to rush, but take time to take in the views and landscape- for example, after the first saddle, to hike up to the ridge to your left, and sit and admire the great views of the whole pound."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Not being familiar with the area we found it really hard to find people who would give honest and good advise. We were told it was at least a 2hr drive from Alice Springs. It only took us 1 1/2 hrs. We were told to do the pound walk which would take 3-4 hours. We spent 2 1/2 hours on this exhausting walk in pretty ordinary landscape to find the highlight was all in the last 30 minutes. If you do the 5 min water hole walk and then walk past the water hole for a further 15 min you will be deep in the amazing ormiston gorge yet the only way they guide you to see this is to do the whole 3 hour walk in the other direction through wilderness grasslands and see this only at the end. If you love bush walking and have loads of time sure do the pound walk, but if like us you're a tourist trying to fit in as much as you can and want the highlights of just the gorge don't waste your time on this long walk through grassland. Do the water hole walk - continue walking into the gorge along the rived bed track (in the opposite direction to the pound walk arrows) and walk for as far as you continue to be amazed by the great red walls. When returning toward the water hole follow the signs up to the Ghost gum walk up to the lookout over the water hole and you will be able to cover all the highlights in 1 - 1 1/2 hours. Definitely a place worthy of a visit but the entire pound walk was a bit overkill. The kiosk is amazing food - city cafe style quality food in the remote outback. It seems a bit pricey until you see your plate - worth every cent."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Great little day trip outside of Alice Springs. Nice walk through the Gorge up to the spring fed pool. We actually saw some Rock Wallabies during our short visit!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Along the MacDonnell Ranges this spot is a must see. It’s a fantastic geographical feature, which we found peaceful and interesting. It’s a special place for local aboriginal women and we had a sense of that spirituality in there. Beautiful scenery. Interesting geography."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,If you’re doing the Larapinta E2E look forward to the kiosk here. Showers too. Rangers give a few free informative sessions on nature and geology. Check out the itinerary.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"When you drive this scenic route, you look out the sides & see nothing but rocks & small shrubs trees etc. But when you come across these waterholes in the middle of nowhere, they are amazing to see. If you get there at the right time, you can see the rock wallabies drinking or scavenging around the carparks. This also has a nice kiosk to have a cuppa or cold drink.Also has toilet facilities. Very nice place to spend a few hours."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This is a must stop in the Rangers, really love it here. Great walks and beautiful scenery it certainly doesn’t disappoint:)"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Although the water level was low, it was still very majestic. Access is by a paved walkway. The car park area has shaded eating areas, BBQs and a kiosk ( the kiosk has Golden North Giant Twins... Yummmm). Swimming is permitted, so it would be even better on a warm day."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,I can just imagine this place during summer. I doubt there would be a space available in the water. We only had time for a quick walk to the gorge but I would like to spend a bit of time on the walking trails on next visit.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Much better than the overrated Uluru. Amazing views, strange rocks, beautiful walk paths. Reccommended in 100%, must see!!!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This is a beautiful place to visit. We did the pound walk which took us about 3 1/2 hrs. The view from the top is spectacular. You do need to take plenty of water with you and a hat. The walk is not difficult and we saw a few kids walking too. You can camp ,swim and the shop has great coffee"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Ormiston Gorge was a great place to stop and go for a nice tiny walk on a pathway down towards the gorge! It is such a calm and pretty environment. Definitely worth pulling in the see. It would be a lovely spot for a picnic!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This is a must see natural wonder on your West McDonnell ranges tour. You have to see it for yourself. Just wonderful!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A place of tranquility. Stunning jaw dropping scenery. Good for a picnic or to let the kids have a play in the sand. Australia's red centre at its best. Toilets available.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Make sure you take the leisurely stroll in. It’s a beautiful large gorge with a waterhole and you can continue your walk into the gorge go around further over rocks if you are adventurous.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,An easy walk from the car park with a little effort involved. The gorges along this drive are all spectacular in there own way. You can can't miss any of them.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This lovely gorge sits in the West MacDonnell Ranges. Come along and take a short walk through it. Enjoy the red rocks and, perhaps, the water that may lie within it. Watch the birdlife pick around the place. Perhaps you may see some zebra finches."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We dropped into Ormiston to pick up our food to continue onto our off track hike. It's a lovely place with good facilities for camping and picnicking. The cafe delivers up gorgeous homemade cakes. The Gorge is great.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Really nice location - the Cafe did great food and a great breakfast - Highly recommended. Rangers talk (Wednesday nights) was really informative and interesting
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Such a lovely spot, so pretty, and the kisok also had beautiful food and coffee, was a great morning spent exploring then sit back with coffee and cake and admire the scenery and birds."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Very beautiful place indeed. The café was great had a very nice breakfast there which we enjoyed. Walk to the lookout which overlooks the gorge and surrounding area just superb The gorge itself is beautiful. take your time to explore.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We had a great walk with our guide up into the hills and then down into the gorge. We then jumped across many rocks and then had a break in a wonderful little cafe and a well deserved Iced latte
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This site is as spectacular as ever. We visited over twenty five years ago and it did not disappoint.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Had the immense pleasure of being escorted through this area with a traditional custodian. A very sacred and important site for local people and an amazing experience to spend with a traditional custodian.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Another great place to check out. You can walk down along the creek or up onto the sides of the gorge.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Beautiful place and accessible to most. The colours are spectacular and the river gums were like spirits, wise and benevolent in the river bed. Magical place."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We did the 8km pound walk. What an amazing hike. Strenuous but not out of reach if you are semi fit. You don’t have to be a mountain climber just as long as you don’t mind a bit of a work out. Was 31 gegrees when we did it started about 11:00. Views sensational. Terrain changes. Rock climbing the river bed at the end was great and the refreshing swim at the gorge in the end was so cold it took my breath away. Would come back here to do this hike again. Cannot dress highly enough wonderfull 2.5-3 hour hike for semi fit people.and if u like this review and did the walk and enjoyed it go see sunset at from tyres lookout not too far from here
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We didn't really have enough time to spend here BUT had planned to stay at the campground. Until we saw it. The sites were tiny. $20/nt. Very disappointing after other National Park campgrounds - but this one is managed privately. Would like to do the pound walk on return as we just did not have the time.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We spent a whole 8 hours at many of the places on the West Macdonell Ranges. If I only had time to see one of the many beautiful places this would be it. O
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Yes, Ormiston is perhaps the most stunning of the Mac's gorges, but the pound hike is easily the best half day walk and gives you an even better experience of the gorge. If you're up for a 3 to 4 hour loop walk it takes you through breathtaking scenery and several different environments. Worth every step and a trip highlight."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Didn't have time for the longer walks so we went straight to the waterhole on a short paved path. Awesome view of the small pool surrounded by white sandy banks, high red rock walls and green gum trees. Walked around to the other end to get closer pictures of the stretched rustic gorge and its awesome reflections on the water with scattered boulders around. It's where people finishing the Ghost Gum Walk appeared. Great spot for picture taking."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,What a beautiful location. We walked all the way up to the end of the gorge and were amazed by the beauty. Could have stayed there all day.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The Gorge was the last hike we did on our 2 week tour of the NT and also the best. The pound walk had everything you want in a hike - shade, scenery, lookouts, and we went early enough that there were no flys. Absolutely spectacular, and the kiosk has great homemade cakes and slices which you just wouldn’t expect. Coffee was good, also."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We spent the day exploring the West Macdonnel ranges from Alice. We finished the day by doing the spectacular Ghost Gum walk around Ormiston Gorge (took one hour). Then sat and relaxed at the lovely little kiosk and enjoyed a delicious Reuben toastie and iced coffee- absolutely devine!!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The walk to the gorge starts from the visitors centre which is 8km off the main road. There is parking space for cars and caravans and there is a great little Kiosk which serves simple meals and good coffees. Just a short walk to the gorge you are rewarded with great views. There is a lookout perched above the waterhole gives an excellent view of the gorge.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We stayed at the campsite for 3 nights. The kids enjoyed playing on the rocks and sand around the waterhole. One of our kids were brave enough (or silly enough) to swim. Camping at Ormiston also provided the perfect base to explore the nearby destinations in the NP. We walked up the Gorge. It was quite challenging for our three year old. I have a mobility issue (need to walk long distances with a walking stick & be on even ground). While I did complete the walk, I probably shouldn’t have done the amount of rock hopping required. It is a beautiful place & well worth visiting."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,There are colours and shadows and ghost gums and water reflections when put all together make for an outstanding landscape.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"...then it would probably be Ormiston Gorge. Where to start? The scale of it? The colours? The landscape? The swimming? One of the best iced coffees I've ever tasted in the kiosk here? This place spoke to me more about the true heart of Australia than anywhere else in the totally sublime, astounding landscape of this region. White gum trunks, red ochre cliff faces, blue gum leaves (yes, the leaves were blue like cerulean PB36 mixed with teal PG 50), the green creek, the amazing rocks on the lunar landscape valley floor. Yep, this place is eye-gasmic and really hits you in the heart...or the soul or spirit, if such things exist."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A fabulous gorge and the kiosk a great bonus ! It has new managers who are very enthusiastic and friendly. Daily baked cakes to die for, great burgers and more. Highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"What a magical place! Easy access on a good road suitable for all vehicles, walking distance to the gorge and water, and stunning views all round. The colours on the rock walls are stunning, especially if you go early in the morning or later in the afternoon."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"There are quite a few scenic gorges around Alice Springs and Ormiston Gorge is certainly one of them. An easy pathed walk to the ""pool"" however there are other walks around the area for the fitter. Scenery around the area is spectacular - the red rocks and cliffs plus the ghost gums and other plant life. After the walk down and back, enjoy a refreshment at the cafe. The Iced Coffee is probably the best my partner has had."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A must visit when in the area. The colours of the rock face are amazing. I suggest that you take a fly net to put over your hat as the flies are terrible.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The drive out to Ormiston Gorge with stops along the way is a must-do part of any trip to the Alice. A full day's drive sees an incredible variety of landscapes, topped off by a great lunch beside the river at the pub."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Leaving the information shelter near the day only car-park, the Pound walk begins by following the Ormiston Creek for 10 mins before crossing the sandy break in the rocks. The well-marked trail climbs steadily for 20 mins when a saddle is reached. A short (200m) detour to the left climbs above the saddle and provides the best view of the Ormiston Pound. Dawn is a favourite time with spectacular coloured cliffs forming a wall of ancient rocks. The track descends from the saddle through a windy valley before crossing the Pound towards the entrance to Ormiston Gorge. This is an easy walk, however the country is rough with no reliable water or mobile phone reception. Wear sturdy shoes, take a good hat and sun-screen and enough water for 3 hours walking. A fly net is a must!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We have visited Ormiston Gorge several times and without doubt it is one of the best gorge in the Western Macs. The largest and most colourful of the the West Mac gorges, Ormiston boats excellent walking and impressive scenery, permanent water and sweeping views from the nearby mountains. The Ghost Gum Walk is a excellent 45 min walk that climbs to a viewing platform high above the water hole, then descends gradually to the creek bed towards the centre of the gorge and towering red cliffs. The Pound walk is longer and follows the creek bed before climbing to a gap on the southern walls of the pound. The walk has un-interrupted and breathtaking views of the Pound, Mt Giles to the north and Bowmans Gap on the western side. Allow at least 2 hours to complete the Pound circuit walk. Although the trail is well marked, there is no reliable water or shade and no phone reception. Sturdy shoes, a good hat and water are a must."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,An easy walk to a beautiful serene Gorge. A must visit and not far out of Alice. The West McDonald Ranges is a must when travelling to Alice.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,What a little gem of a place. Loved this gorge and it is only just a short stroll from the carpark. Make sure you look out for the ring-necked parrots. We stayed overnight here and were amazed and pleasantly surprised to find not only flushing toilets but a hot shower as well. Cheap to stay here too. This is definitely a place to come to when touring through the West McDonnell Ranges.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge is a must to experience. The water is cold but reasonably comfortable to swim in. If you are lucky enough to be the only visitors there, just sit down under a Red River Gum and take the time to feel the spirituality of this ancient part of the world. There is a walk which is sublime but involves some rock hopping in the gorge, a moderate level of fitness is required."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Great little waterhole. Do the ghost gum walk first to get a birdseye view then visit the waterhole. Take a picnic, its a great spot to chill out."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Do the ghost gum walk first to get a birds-eye view. Take a picnic its a great spot to chill out....
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Great place for a swim when you need to cool down. Stunning scenery. Can be busy. Very popular spot. Did the pound walk as well great views.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We visited Ormiston Gorge with Mark of Sandrifter Safaris. As luck would have it we had this piece of paradise all to our selves. Enjoyed the scenery and had a refreshing swim in the pool. Good amenities and car park.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We arrived around the middle of the day and enjoyed a very cold swim. We had an amazing lunch at the Kiosk and then set up camp in the Natioinal Parks campground. We did the walk to the lookout which was very worthwhile with great views. We went back for a late afternoon swim in the gorge but it was in full shadow and very chilly. The campground doesn't allow fires but has lots of bbqs and reasonable camping spaces and clean facilities with showers (opened for night campers only).
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Definitely recommend a stop at Ormiston Gorge. It has a beautiful (cold) water hole and so many photo opportunities, we didnt want to leave!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This is one awesome location especially if you are lucky enough to sit and enjoy music by artists from the Desert Song Festival as we did.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Came here for a swim as part of a tour, and it was great. Pretty easy access, enough area for a good swim."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Definitely worth the drive from Alice Springs to see! The beauty of the Aussie desert is a must. The watering hole is cool and safe to swim. With a small walk you can see the splendour of the Ormiston Gorge. After a swim you have to stop at the kiosk and have their fresh scones with jam & cream. Prices are very reasonable and the people extremely friendly.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,About 75 minutes from Alice Springs along all bitumen roads this location was a highlight of our visit to the West McDonnell Ranges area. The camp grounds are extremely well maintained and the kiosk offered a great range of food options including items made by the operator. We had a steak sandwich which was very reasonably priced and was the best I have ever had. The swimming area was very popular especially with young families. A definite place to visit if you are in the area.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,An example of the outstanding scenery of this wonderful part of the world. Visited here as the last stop on a long day bus trip and found it to be a perfect spot to end the day. Some care needed but a great spot for a swim on a hot afternoon.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Just over an hours drive west of Alice Springs. This gorge have great walking trails to the top and through the bottom. A photographers dream location/
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"cool, clear waters when there is water. It is a piece of heaven when you're there alone. Go in the morning if you can and have the place to yourself!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We almost bypassed going to the Ormiston Gorge. At check out, the clerk suggested we backtrack and visit the gorge as it was his favorite view. The colors of the gorge walls and the river running through it, pooling up in the waterholes was quite lovely."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,There are so many places to see along this range. Each one is quite different and offers walks and camp sites at some.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This was one of our favourite spots on the Larapinta Trail. You could spend days here, walking, exploring, hiking, swimming or just lazing by the crystal clear pools. Breathtaking."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A very refreshing waterhole to visit . We visited the waterhole when we walked the Larapinta trail. Ormiston Gorge to Glen Helen.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,You’ll be best rewarded if you break out and do some of the walks around the area. Stunning ancient landscapes which changing vistas. Snakes are active at night (including in the toilet blocks where they go to hunt frogs) so always carry a bright torch. They’ll do their utmost to avoid you but I wouldn’t want to step on one by mistake.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Just be first there or last. If not, it will be impossible to, as photographers say, get the light. Or as them with a smartphone say, get the fat white tourists out the way. If you manage either the pic just might capture the beauty of this very special spot."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Waterhole is great but too many people visit so go very early. Pound Walk is spectacular but is best seen at sunrise. Incredible place, big nature at its best. The walk is challenging (it's a well-marked path) especially the last part through the gorge, as it's over big boulders. Do it and you will be rewarded with a swim in the gorge (and no people so no trunks). I am told King Brown snakes also swim there but I did not see any. It's very very deep in the middle, so be careful."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Nice place for a picnic and a swim. This place can get a bit crowded on weekends as it is a great place for families. For those who like to hike there are a number of trails.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Beautiful Place would have loved to have a paddle Good toilets to Scenery is great can see local wildlife Rock wallibies
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Great place for a dip on a hot day, have a picnic at the water hole, stretch your legs after the long drive or just take a break and enjoy the scenery."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Spectacular and beautiful landscape. Great swimming sport after a hike in the hot sun. There is also a look out point which give great views.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Great for a visit. Big parking and a kiosk where you can buy some food and drinks. No WiFi. Well maintained path to the water but when we were there at the beginning of December it was dry and the water was low. I think it’s much better just after the raining season.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Only wish I had my swimming gear as others did for a dip into this refreshing water shaded on both sides by awesome rock walls .Amazing!,"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We walked through here after a long trek. Popular spot for swimmers but it was a lovely place to visit.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"My partner and I drove out from Alice Springs. There are a number of hikes to be done. We hiked into the gorge and came back via the riverbed. Lots of wildlife and it’s not a hard walk at all. There are some undulating surfaces but it’s very manageable for most levels of fitness. It is well worth the drive out. Get to the water, sit and watch all the wildlife and enjoy the silence!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,If your hot and bothered this is the place to come. A natural watering hole that offers a hot traveller a relaxing cool swim. The water hole is surrounded by magnificent scenery. Well worth a visit for a quick visit or pack a picnic basket and enjoy a swim and time to sook in the scenery
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"An excellent walk, about 7-8 km with stunning views. It was a very hot day, around 40 degrees, with a breeze. The final way through the gorge can change year to year.....this time it was a very long boulder hop..... and one needs 2+ lites of water."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"My partner and I explored the Mc Donald Ranges last month! Ormiston Gorge blew our minds to the point that we stayed overnight at the little camp ground!plenty of bays available , nice and clean, with recycling rubbish bins, shower, toilets. The walk up to the lookout is amazing! and also swimming in the gorge"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Towering cliffs that overlook the most amazing ""hole"". Australia is a great country that keeps throwing up surprises - and this is another. Don't miss it!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,long walk but the view at the end of the walk is stupendous. A must visit on any itiniray put yor feet min the water.Sooo cooling.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The Gorge is just so lovely a short walk to , water there for a dip ,great photo spot ,so quiet to just sit & take in the surrounds, not to miss seeing this gorge."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We called in for lunch and coffee, We were very pleased with the food, service and friendly attitude of the staff. I didn’t expect the ploughman’s lunch I ordered to be so large(for 2) for the price and to be so fresh. We had cake too and it was also fresh. A great experience. The coffee was nice too."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"You really feel in touch with this place, spirtal healing, I loved the lookout hike, make sure you walk up beyond the water hole, breath taking scenery the further you go"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,what an amazingly beautiful place to visit. the colours. the shades. the water. the rocks. the ambience
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Definitely stop by and check out this gorge. This road is littered with beautiful spots to stop and see just outside of Alice Springs. Definitely worth the drive, and maybe a revisit!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The path to the ghost gum lookout is well constructed with concrete even-sized steps and only minor rocks in the path. There are clean flushable toilets - so if you're visiting a series of gorges and gaps on this road, it's a useful place for a break. The kiosk has food if you need it but there are also undercover seats for self-provided dining options."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We have decided to explore Australia. What an amazing place.Picture postcard.You cannot stop taking photos. We stayed in the camp ground with showers and toilets for $10 each. We would definetely come back here and just relax. The swimming is amazing.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Part of Larapinta Trail hike! A beautiful respite in such a diverse ecosystem. Very nice place to take a break in your day for lunch, snack, dinner, whatever!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We arrived early in the morning and beat the heat. We walked up to the first lookout, which gives you views down into the gorge, this walk continues further along the edge of the gorge. The walk is lovely, a little bit uphill and uneven but not too strenuous. We then walked along the river bed into the gorge itself for another perspective."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We spent a couple of hours here just relaxing and swimming this stunning waterhole. Helpful if you have a flotation to hold onto so you can really float under the overhang and take in the markings of the rocks. Water is cool but once in, you adjust fairly quickly. I don't swim often but actually stayed in for long periods of time, I was so peaceful, even as groups came and went. Didn't even get up to the lookout but loved it so much, we are thinking of returning before we leave the area."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A great experience- about 90mins drive from Alice Springs. We walked the Ghost Gum walk up to the beautiful lookout (30mins return) which had a few stairs but wasn't difficult. Sunscreen is a must! And the kiosk was a welcome surprise- excellent quality food with quite a few options. A great meal!!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Loved the walk though bit of a challenge on a very hot day. Great views from the top; lots of rocks to negotiate walking back along the river. For birders, saw dusky grass wrens on rocks near end of track"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The longer Pound walk takes you up a ridge and down into the top end of the gorge. Views are spectacular all the way and you can take in the lookout on the ghost gum trail on your return. Apart from hopping some boulders to get down the dry gorge bed, this walk is pretty easy."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,If you have half a day to spare then Ormiston Gorge is for you! We did the Rim walk up to the lookout and back down through the Gorge and loved every minute of it. The rugged gorge walls and the Ghost Gums along the river bed were simply beautiful. We also did the Panorama Walk and although challenging at times it was certainly worth it for the view up the gorge and across the range.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The atmosphere of this gorge and surrounds is breathtaking. From the rock walls to the lovely, but cold, water. We also hiked around the Ormiston Pound that is really worthwhile. Do not forget to walk up to the Ghost Gum lookout for a spectacle view. Then have a lovely meal at the cafe. Excellent food and coffee."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"There are gorges and there are gorges around Alice Springs but Ormiston Gorge has got to be one of the prettiest gorges in the area. A sealed road leads into a sealed car park, a small cafe off to one side, lots of interpretive signage for flora, fauna and geology. There are walks to cater for all aspects of physical ability, we walked up the gorge quite a way past the sand bars and over the rocks for a distance. There is a hike up to a fairly elevated lookout that is built out over the gorge. The rock colours in the gorge walls are all wonderful shades of red and orange, all several billion years old. My advice, go early, spend as much time as you have available and go prepared for hiking, with water, camera and good footwear."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"What a beautiful area. We visited on a cooler day, but imagine this would be a fabulous place for a swim and further examination of the rocky areas not accessible on foot."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The walk through the gorge is good with a chance to see some of the Rock wallabies that use the area. The surrounding area changes as you drive through it.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Ormiston gorge is a great place to get a good feel for the West Macdonnel ranges. The camping is ground is no frills but comfy and quiet with an honesty box (coming from South Africa this phenomenon stills surprises me). The walks especially the pound walk - are fantastic. It still gets hot in winter time during the day so take plenty of water. Bird watchers will enjoy this place
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Some easy walking trails. Amazing bird life and beautiful scenery. Also has a great kiosk - fresh food, friendly service and reasonable prices."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Stunning is all I can say. Well worth the trip and you can do a day trip to visit looking at other things. Take the time to go.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A must see white visiting Alice, and an easy day trip by road. Make sure to have good shoes, plenty of water, your camera and give yourself plenty of time to go on one of the many walks on offer."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A stunning example of middle Australia nature. This ancient and beautiful gorge carved out over millions of years is an absolute must if you are visiting the West McDonnell Ranges. While you are there make sure you allow at least 2 hours to do the Ghost Gum walk.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We camped for 2 nights at Orminston Gorge ($18 a night unpowered site). The campsites are first come best dressed and they seemed to be pretty full by 4pm in the afternoon. There are no powered sites, but there are hot showers, BBQ's and a coffee shop!!! The walks in the surrounding area are beautiful and fairly easy, the gorge is very peaceful and the wildlife is amazing. Worth a visit and try to stay the night if you can."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"For a great day out near Alice Springs, head west along Larapinta Drive, then branch off onto Namatjira Drive along the edge of Tjoritja (West Macdonnell) National Park, visiting Standley Chasm, Ellery Creek Big Hole, Ochre Pits Serpentine Gorge and finally Osmiston Gorge, a lovely oasis of water, greenery and rust red rocks. The round trip is about 160 mile. We had a really ""gorge-ous"" day!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We visited this gorge on a day tour out of Alice Springs. This gorge was easy to walk to and the scene was lovely. There is also another walk to a lookout you can do. I believe it is lovely.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Great views and an interesting area. You must visit the gorge but also take in the views of Ormiston Pound from the lookout and if you have time walk through the pound and the gorge. Make sure you allow plenty of time and take water with you and be prepared for some minor rock scrambling but well worth it. The cafe has the best ice coffee I have ever had!!!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We camped here for 3 nights and walked for 3 days, and loved every moment of it. Good café at the day visitor area, and fabulous gorge, better than most around this area. Walk around the Ormiston Pound is spectacular."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The two hour drive is well rewarded with amazing landscape and wildlife, especially birds. There is a cafe and facilities for picnic and barbeque."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge is a great place to visit, great scenery and a great place to camp, The Kiosk is outstanding, service is excellent and, although small, the food is terrific. The manager, Red, is extremely friendly and goes out of his way to assist. ."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We loved the walk of the ghost gums. Simply glorious! Fairly easy walk which keeps surprising at every turn.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,a beautiful walk in this spectacular gorge. walk a little tricky at times over boulders but a really beautiful and serine spot to be.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The waterhole, canyon, and White gums lookout were spectacular. The team at the kiosk were very helpful and friendly. We stayed overnight and enjoyed the warm shower and quite surrounds. This site was very well presented and the information very detailed. Well done a great experience."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"One of, if not the most spectacular and picturesque gorge in the Ranges. A good range of walks for all levels of fitness."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This beautiful waterhole location makes a restful, picturesque stop as part of a full day site seeing from Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Well looked after campground with kiosk, toilet facilities were clean, showers hot when the sun is out 😊 The gorge walk not to be missed..."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Great place to stay we stayed here two nights and explored the surrounding area the gorge was well worth the visit and the cafe is a little gem try the custard sq.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Take the long walk (Pound Trail, 7.5 km) if you can. It isn't particularly difficult but there is a long uphill and quite a bit of walking on rocks and sand. It's stunning, especially the rocks within the Gorge itself. Wear serious hiking shoes, take water and at least a snack, and your camera! Worth the 2 hr drive from Alice Springs."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Must see destination, Was there in early July very cold water. Would be great in warmer weather. Grat little Kiosk, great food and fruit smoothies"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Although at this time of the year most rivers and many places that hold water are dry, this wasn't true of Ormiston Gorge. A reasonable sized pool of water flanked by a large area of sand and surround by glorious rock formations. A place to relax or take great photos"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"My favourite place from our trip, such an amazing experience with so many things to look at but still a tranquil place that you can sit back and just look around at what Mother Nature has to offer. You have to do a bit of a walk to get to the amazing spots but it is well worth it. There is also a big walk to a lookout which we didn't do but will be doing on our next visit to the area."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Had a lovely walk here amazing views from the top of the Gorge and then also when walking down to the bottom of the Gorge. sandy beach at the bottom that families were making use of. Great service at the Kiosk , lovely carrot cake and Iced coffee after our walk well worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This was a great location with awesome views the opportunity to swim followed by a BBQ on the facilities provided or something from the café if that is your preference.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Another excellant gorge to visit in the West Macdonnell ranges. We did the walks up to the lookout, where you get excellant views and back down through the gorge. The water holes are amazing to see when you realize how dry the area can be sometimes. Kiosk and facility's here are very good ideal place to camp and spend a couple of days."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Loved it - saw it as part of a day tour, but could esily spend more time here. Very picturesque. Cool and the colours off the cliff faces breathtaking."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"When you're at the end of an easy climb onto a staircase, all of a sudden; a majestic view into history. Descending down into the gorge you will see at the bottom a beautifull and impressive Dali landscape and making your way through to the end you are rewarded with paradise. Jump in and swim/enjoy this garden of Eden. Amazing"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Do not miss. It is very close to Glen Helen Resort and only takes a few minutes to drive. Go to lookout and the waterhole.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We visited both gorges - Redbank and Ormiston and I would recommend Ormiston to visit. Ormiston has a lovely cafe for drinks or lunch to start, then pleasant walk on walkway all the way to the gorge. Gorge is pretty and features a nice cave. Swimming allowed in summer."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Friendly, helpful staff, the food was good but the coffee was great and well worth the visit. Then there is the view. Can't do it all in one day, make a weekend of it."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Another stop along the Red Centre Way from Alice Springs to Uluru. The car park is about 7km from the main highway and is unusual in having a welcome refreshment kiosk and WC's. There is a short and easy walk from the car park to the gorge. When we were there in March there was some disruption as one of the paths was being resurfaced but not a big problem. If you are feeling a bit more agile you can walk off the path through sand to the other side of the pool and get a glimpse of the end of the gorge. Colours are just beautiful. Flies are an irritant so take a head net if you can. Kiosk is great for a drink and/or ice cream before hitting the road again. Highly recommended.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Ormiston Gorge is a spot one must vist. The beautfiul colours and the great walks one can do. Not far out of Alice Springs at all
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This is another place where you need an informed guide to tell the stories relevant to the gorge. Otherwise, I would say I have seen better gorges elsewhere."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Very pretty spot. Need to walk into it from the carpark/camping area. Camping limited and basic, but the gorge is beatiful, and you can have a swim there. Worth a drive so see it."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Good food homemade, good walk, can have à swim, friendly staff. You should go there. Camping fees 10 $ night."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Stayed here for two nights on a family holiday. Great spot to explore the West Mac Ranges and then come back for a swim in the gorge on the beautiful sandy banks. The facilities were also good (warm shower) and there's a kiosk that sells ice creams and coffee (and food) which was a bonus. You can pay for camping at the kiosk using card if you'd run out of cash like we had). Love love love this spot.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"I passed through Ormiston Gorge during my hike on the Larapinta Trail, so I spent a bit of time hiking in the gorge, the pound and out to Mt Giles - it was grand! The Ormiston Kiosk managers, red and May were fantastic, friendly and so supportive. I just want to say a big thank you to Red, Mary, NT Parks and Viktor and Zak from Larapinta Trail Trek Support (LTTS) for making my Larapinta Trail experience so amazing!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A short walk from the car park & you come to this amazing place. The river gums, the rock formations, the water. You could spend half a day here.Absolutely worth the drive!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The water looked so inviting and the surrounds are so picturesque. Lovely colouring for perfect photo's. Don't forget to take your camera
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A short (ca 500 meter) walk from the parking area brings you to this popular water hole - while the water is cold, the sun is nice and warm, and the place is peaceful and enchanting - a must while visiting West MacDonnell ranges."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Well worth stopping at, even if only briefly as it's just stunning and there's a real tranquillity there. Didn't have time to do the walks there, but would have loved to."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We stayed overnight at Ormiston Gorge recently in early March and found we were the only campers which made our stay even more special. Camp fees were reasonable ($10 per person per night) and the amenities were very adequate with toilets and hot showers. Camp area is well set out with individual sites marked our and numbered and there were gas BBQs available (didn’t use them though). The sites are quite close together and fairly rocky but we were just happy to set up our tent and enjoy the quietness of being alone there. There is a separate camp area for large groups. I can’t recall now but I think that there were about 18-20 sites and it is a first come basis with no bookings taken. The whole area of Ormiston Gorge and Pound is very well set up for day visitors as well as the campers and there were works/repairs being carried out on the path to the swimming hole while we were there after heavy rains in Dec/Jan. A good kiosk is there as well for refreshments. We walked the Pound loop and absolutely loved the experience. It did take us the suggested 4 hours as at that time we had to swim and/or wade in three places towards the end of the walk due to the recent rains. We had met the lovely young Park ranger who said that the water was slowly getting cooler but we found it very pleasant. At that time of the year and after walking for a few hours it was a very welcome swim and only added to the whole experience. We had no issues doing the walk at that time of the year, leaving just before sunrise so we were back before the heat of the day. The scenery throughout the walk was fantastic and varied with some boulder sections but overall not too difficult (we are mid 50s and average fitness and had no trouble at all). There were no other visitors in the park that day so we really enjoyed the solitude of the walk. It was just beautiful and peaceful. The short walk up to Ghost Gum lookout is a must as well for a fantastic view of the Gorge. It is impossible not to take too many photos of this place - Definitely worth the visit and overnight stay !!"

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Ormiston Pound was a wonderful walk with stunning views across the Pound and beautiful colours in the gorge. We had to cross the waterhole near the end - about 90 cm deep today so no problem. The big surprise of the day was our lunch at the kiosk. Mary served up a beautiful home-cooked quiche with REAL salad. It was delicious and really topped our day. Rod also does a pretty good coffee - so you've got to give this kiosk a try. You won't be disappointed!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Just a wonderful place. Can walk on an easy track or a more difficult one. Picnic facilities and a lot of information about the area is well posted
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Just over an hour on bitumen from Alice, lies this amazing place. A peaceful waterhole surrounded by sand dunes with stunning vistas in all directions. You could laze around for hours and even the flies politely leave you alone. And when you done, you can have an ice coffee in a kiosk at the entrance. Paradise!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We camped here for a few days over Easter and found the camp ground and facilities to be great. A big thanks to Mary & Redman who run the kiosk and manage the camp - they are both absolute gems and make a fab place even more special. Ormiston gorge is awesome. The only unfortunate part is the increasingly excessive park infrastructure - specifically the path to the gorge is excessive and detracting from the natural aesthethics. However, the ridge walk and pound walks are both great."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Beautiful oasis in the middle of nowhere.. Perfect break location after being on the tourist coach. Beautiful Australian photo location.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Great spot to a great Gorge with some water. The day we visited was a cool so we did not go for a swim but other people sure did. Great Spot.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We were absolutely craving a decent coffee so we drove down to the kiosk. We were on our way to another gorge so we didn't go to the waterhole but the kiosk was amazing. The lovely lady behind the counter makes all of the baked goods and they are bloody terrific! The coffee was okay but the food was great, seriously, this is a must stop."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"An interesting stop along the way. Nice little cafe (thanks Red and wife for a much needed great tea and Hedgehog!), and informative notice boards in the shelters. Good place for a swim."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"When camping in Ormiston Gorge (very friendly staff - cheers to Mary and Red - and good coffee 😉) we went on a helicopter flight at glen helen - it was great!!! Justin was a cool pilot, the landscape is simply amazing from above and I truly enjoyed it (to my surprise: no fear of hights at all!!)"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This wonderful relic is a tranquil place for all to enjoy its natural beauty with a range of beach-like swimming spots. It transforms from riverbanks to sandy shorelines and into a steep, rocky gorge with the vivid green and red West MacDonnell ranges to the rear. A great place for families or travellers who need some R&R, a quiet spot for reading, or just to cool off. Thoroughly recommended. Bonus: there is a small kiosk open 10-4 with the necessary zooper doopers or a friendly face. Note: there was some construction to replace the foot path to the gorge. There are plentiful hikes available, from a 20-30min lookout over the gorge, to 1.5hr hike, or even a 4hr hike. Check out the NT website for specific details."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Enjoyed another trip to Ormiston Gorge which is bursting with water at the moment, and ideal for swimming in the hot weather. The kiosk has new ownership and a new menu with homemade treats as well, and is open more frequently, which is awesome as it's so good to get a cool drink here after a refreshing swim. They also have BBQ packs from Milner Meats which is awesome! All facilities were clean and it looks like they are upgrading the path too. Such a great visit!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Off the beaten track and very quiet, you don't want to miss Ormiston Gorge. Beautiful unpowered camping with clean facilities. Our welcome from Red and Mary was open arms and they had plenty of suggestions. The swimming hole, the beautiful gorge and the Pound walk are truly spectacular and should not be missed if visiting the Red Centre."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This is a must stop near Glen Helen. Warm water; swim with small fish. The views when you swim around the corner can't be imagined form a photo. Allow an hour to hour and a half.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This was my favourite place in the MacDonnell Ranges and one of my favourites across the whole of our trip. The Gorge was an easy and fairly short walk from the carpark. The cliffs rose up steeply and redly above a cool, peaceful looking waterhole. There was a large sandy beach along one side of the water, with fascinating gum trees scattered around. We swam in the waterhole which was cold and refreshing, but not so cold that we couldn't stay in for a good while. There was plenty of sun on the water for most of the afternoon. Opposite the beach the water went right up to the cliff face so it was possible to swim over and look straight up at the rocks. It was incredibly beautiful and incredibly peaceful. We saw water birds and the younger kids enjoyed exploring the rocks around the edge of the water rather than going for a swim. The rocks were patterned and interesting shapes. After our swim we walked up to the lookout above the waterhole. The views across the MacDonnell ranges were interesting as we gained height. There were again interesting rocks and plants to look at as we walked. There were a lot of stairs, but it wasn't a long walk to the lookout. From here we could see along the gorge and really see the layers of rocks that made up the cliff walls. The waterhole looked amazing from this view as well. There were a couple of ghost gums up near the lookout that added something really special to the view. There is a longer walk through the gorge that we didn't do. The water level was high when we were there and at times the walk would have involved wading through water - this varies depending on how much rain there has been. That walk is a lot harder than simply going up to the lookout, but it sounded fantastic. There is a kiosk near the carpark which serves food during the day and there is lots of information available about the area. There is a camping ground there - if we'd realised how great the gorge was we would have camped here and spent much more time exploring the gorge. The kiosk sometimes serves pizza at night for those in the campground. We found it hard to leave this place, it was magical and one of our absolute highlights."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,a near permanent swimming hole surrounded by a beautiful gorge wall. spectacular spot in a gorgeous part of the world. there is a visitor info centre at entrance to gorge area
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A hidden place in West MacDonnell Range is Ormiston Gorge. A walk to the top or to the water is an excellent way the spent a afternoon in West MacDonnell Range.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"If you are into walking and exploring the gorge, then this is the place you will enjoy - but not during summer!! It will get very hot and you need plenty of drinking water. Some great walk trails and if you happen to be there just after some major rains, it is even more spectacular."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Relatively strenuous but short walk to lookout. Definitely worth the view. Excellent water hole but beware the water is deep so may not be suitable for kids
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Bought a coffee at the kiosk and it was as good as they advertise it to be. The gorge was beautiful, it would be a great place to cool off in the warmer months"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"I have seen a lot in Australia but Ormiston Gorge is onenof the most impressive places I have been to! The steep walls on top of you when hiking and swimming theough the gorge are just overwhelming. The colours, the peace!! Absolutely amazing place!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We did the Ghost Gum Walk. The beautiful lake at the end is gorgeous, serene! surrounded by big red rocks, its so calm in there and the red reflection looks amazing! 2-3 leisurely easy walk offers some great views!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We visited Ormiston Gorge from Alice Springs in our own hire car. It is about 128km on bitumen road, but so lovely & peaceful. The gorge was pretty full of water, having had a wetter winter in Australia & we both ventured in for a swim in the cool water. Flocks of green budgies singing & parrots were readily seen, along with some Water Moniters sunning on rocks. There is a kiosk with pleasant staff & shaded seating to enjoy a drink or munch. There is a small camp area adjacent for tent campers. We would suggest, as it's just about the furthest on the bitumen road, starting there and working your way back towards Alice."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Really nice campground with shower and toilets. The swimming hole was gorgeous and perfect after a hot day travelling. Wish we could have stayed longer as we didn't get out the water to do the walks we wanted to do....next time :)
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The camping here is reasonable. There are flush toilets and showers. There is a restaurant, shop on site as well as plenty of parking for day visitors. The gorge itself and the Ghost Gum walk are lovely calm places to be. The Pound walk is not difficult until you have to wade thru the water at the end of the loop walk. Scenery gorgeous and on the day we walked there was hardly another soul on the track."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Loved this spot!! The ormiston gorge is absolutely stunning and you can't beat the iced coffee at the cafe. One of my favourite memories on my Australian adventure defintely had to be pulling up to the cafe at 430 pm, seeing the sign say ""close"" and me saying ""oh man they closed, I guess I can't get that coffee"" (which I had been told was a must)! What are the chances, the owner is in the back and hears me... The nicest man comes out and says were you after some coffee and I kept saying its okay you are closed now and he said no no I'll do it for you guys, you came all this way! What a special moment. GO HERE! The owner is SO NICE! And the gorge and coffee are incredible."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Ormiston Gorge is probably the most photographed area in the West MacDonnells and it is not to be missed. The geology of the Gorge is so interesting and a walk along the river is a must to see the wildflowers and the rock structure of the gorge.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Did the Ormiston Pound Walk with my Wife and two children (11,13) two days ago. We headed off in the recommended anti-clockwise direction at about 7.00am. We had a very leisurely stroll. Stopped numerous times to take shoes off and wade through water and for other breaks. Walked to the lookout off the track at about the half way mark and it was well worth the small detour as the views were outstanding. Stopped next to a flowing creek for morning tea which was great. Towards the end of the walk we had to wade through quite a bit of water but the sandbanks made it easy. There was a stretch of about 5-10 metres that we had to swim through so take that into consideration and don't drown your camera like I did. We completed the walk by midday but as stated it was very leisurely. My Wife is not very fit but she still completed the walk easily, as did my children. The walk would take a lot less time without as much water around but that made it nice in other ways. There were also a great variety of wild flowers around which was nice. I would highly recommend this walk especially if you do not have the time to do any of the more scenic sections of the Larapinta Trail. I have completed the entire trail and if you are thinking of doing it then this would probably be a good intro."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This gorge is an easily accesible and beautiful place to visit. We visited with 2 young children and even though the water was too cold for me its still a nice spot to stop for an hour or half a day.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The Ormistion Gorge & Pound walk is one of the jewels of The Red Centre. It's easy to spend two or three days there based in the camping ground. The range of habitats takes you from the semi permanent waterhole of the Gorge itself and is a restful bird & rock wallaby watching base. The ghost gum lookout walk is relatively easy and gives some great photo opportunities. The Pound walk is more for experienced hikers. Take a cut lunch and enjoy some breath taking scenery, a range of habitats and some wonderful shady picnic spots. This was a highlight of our trip."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The gorge is lovely to walk around in, there are Aborignal rock paintings there, they are not signposted and a bit hard to find but easy to get to. Just look to the left whe. You enter the gorge and you will see a fence, that's where you will find them. Other than that it's a pretty place with some great colourful rock walls."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This place welcomes you with hospitable cafe, iced coffee can be recommended, then stunning walk around the gorge. Do the circular walk, absolutely worth it and doable with 5-year old kid."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Arrived a few minutes before 4pm, not expecting to find a cafe, but wanting a camp site for the night. Although cafe due to close at 4pm, ordered coffee and brownie and were served with courtesy, humour and no sense of hurry. Camping area only had two sites left, neither of which were all that suitable for us, and when I mentioned this to Nick behind the counter he said no problem and offered us a site in the coach camping area as there we no coaches expected. Very considerate. The gorge looked spectacular in the morning light, and a hot chocolate and fresh muffin (baked fresh by the wife of one of the rangers) was a fitting conclusion to our visit. Definitely worth the visit."

You can go to many gorges along Red Centre Way and even pay for the experience but few equal the beauty of Ormiston. Half our group hiked there along the Larapinta Trail while my daughter and I drove. We met at the good cafe that had the most amazing hazelnut brownies, although my long black coffee was a bit average (little crema or body). It has a lovely walk around the ridge and down into the gorge. Recommended for anyone in the area."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The koisk is a welcome oasis for walkers on the Larapinta Trail. After 10 days hiking and living on dehydrated food we arrived at Ormiston Gorge on pizza night. What a pleasant surprise! Nick's pizzas were excellent and he even organised some live music for the night. A very pleasant evening was spent under the covered area of the kiosk eating pizza and enjoying some good music. Followed up next day with hot chocolate and muffins before hitting the trail again. Nick and Bec and their friendly staff do an excellent job.The kiosk prices are very reasonable considering the remoteness of the place, and the food is great. The walk around the gorge is not hard and provides some great views. Do the walk and then drop in to the kiosk for some refreshments."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Awesome campground, warm shower, flushing toilet, fabulous BBQS and a kiosk! Everything you could need. The ranger talks were very informative and the walks and scenery were spectacular. Up there with Kings Canyon."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"What a stunning setting. Originally we were staying a couple of days but it was nearly a week by the time we moved on. Beautiful wildlife, clean toilets, warm showers. A KIOSK. No reason to leave! The walks were so beautiful and we still didn't get to do all of them. The people looking after the place were super friendly and easy going. We keep saying this was our favourite part of our six weeks trip through central Australia."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We left on a 7km walk and found it classed as a moderate walk way harder than you think, great scenery but quite hard to manage some of the rocks and hills."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge was one of our favourite walks. We could not believe the views. We were all truly amazed, Its a must see."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Great place to explore the West Mac ranges. Decent hike and beautiful scenery. Best time to go is in the middle of the year.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The lovely lady who looks after the shop and camp made us feel very welcome. The walks were fantastic with incredible elevated views. A photographer's dream.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Location Located about 125 km west of Alice Springs in the Western MacDonnell Ranges. Sealed Road all the way. Service N/a as we did not use the caf/shop Value N/a Free entry. Do not use the caf/shop. Atmosphere The best Gap that we saw in the MacDonnell Ranges. We did the Ghost Gum Loop which is a 1 hour loop. You climb to a lookout platform with a large Ghost Gum. The platform allows a view down onto the last part of the Gorge. From here you can go back the same way or follow the track as it meanders down the other side and comes out at the creek bed and back to the starting point along the creek bed. As they had recently had rain we did get our feet wet (deepest part was about 30 mm deep). There was a sign at the start that did warn about needing to wade cold water. There is also a 3 to 4 hour Pound Walk and those would definitely have gotten wet. We did not do this longer walk. There is a caf/shop at the start along with toilets, picnic area, etc Overall Great walk for medium fitness walkers but you may get wet feet depending on the recent rainfall. For less fit walkers there is a 20-minute walk to the waterhole which is flat and does not involve getting wet feet. The waterhole is deep enough for swimming. Give this one a 5/5 and it should go on your must do walks."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A beautiful place to visit. The walk to the summit is worth the effort for the fantastic views of the gorge, then trek down and if travelling on a hot day cool down in the waterhole and enjoy a picnic, BBQ or meal at the cafe"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"AMAZING INCREDIBLE UNFORGETTABLE are the words to describe my experience of doing the Pound Walk! If you've got the time and fitness...DO IT! It's 3-4 hrs walk, not extremely difficult but do require some good walking experience. Children can do it too if you think they are healthy and up for it. I met a father who brought his 1 yo baby boy and 5 yo girl to do this walk and they made it! The kids loved it and did incredibly well. I was so happy for them! Preparation is everything so make sure you prepare yourself well: Good broken-in hiking shoes, water 3L, sunscreen, flynet and hat. All of these are compulsory, esp the water and sunscreen. Walkers will be completely exposed to the sun with no shades at all from the starting point to finish. Wear the flynet cos the flies were extremely annoying and made it impossible to even see or breathe properly. The sun was already unforgiving early in the morning and it just sapped out all the moisture from your body and hence water of 3L was very essential. The walks followed clear paths in the first halfway through and went uphills. The highlight of the walk was when you reached the middle point and the path just opened up to reveal the whole landscape...INCREDIBLE!!! The last halfway was all dry rocky creekbeds. That's why a good and properly broken in hiking shoes was a must. Be prepared to do lots and lots of rock hoppings. When I was there, it was completely dry but during wet months, I read that walkers would need to take off the shoes and cross the waterhole. There's no defined path on these rocky bits so make your own path and just walk straight ahead. There would be arrows or sign every now and then to guide you. It all looked very exhausting and endlessly painful but the reward at the end of this walk was pretty sweet! I've got to swim in the amazing waterhole and it felt pretty awesome! Choose to swim right at the end of waterhole as soon as you finished the walk cos then you would avoid the crowds. I had the whole portion of the waterhole for myself cos no one made the effort to swim that far. Sweet as! It's an incredible walk that I will never ever forget."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"an amazing walk, the pound walk, going around and back through the gorge, some swimming is required at the end, only about 50 mts, we took a bucket to put cameras and backpacks in, the walk is really interesting, takes you up a bit, then to a lovely place to swim, and back throught the gorge, with the most amazing rock formations, took hundreds of photos! we camped at the finke river, free bush camping, and very close by"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge is another beautiful location well worthwhile visiting in West MacDonnell National Park. We decided not to do the Loop Walk as that appeared to require some wading and perhaps even swimming and we did not have appropriate gear, particularly to protect our cameras. We did the Waterhole Walk first - it's short and provides easy access to a beautiful waterhole. Then we did the Ghost Gum Walk. The view from the lookout is spectacular. We then continued the Ghost Gum Walk loop which picks up the last part of the full Loop Walk. We had no difficulty wading across the river as indicated on the map but then found it impossible to get back to the other side without swimming - I felt this part of the walk was badly marked and we may have missed the correct crossing point. So we had to turn around and simply walk back the way we came. It was still a wonderful walk and we really enjoyed the views. In total, we were walking for about 3 hours. The kiosk is small but provided very tasty toasted sandwiches and a great iced coffee."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We stayed here for 2 nights, as one just wasn't enough. The place is just ""beauty personified"". It is simply stunning & you MUST take a swim in the permanent waterhole that sits at the base of the gorge. Make time to take the walk around the rim of the gorge & also the short ""Ghost Gum"" walk up to the lookout where you look down the middle of the gorge, with the waterhole at the base. Try to do the short walk about an hour before sunset, The colours of the rock faces are spectacular. The camping ground is worth staying at. There is no grass for tents but if you get there early enough, you will find a good spot. One tip: If you are erecting a tent, bring a hammer, good strong tent-pegs & a hammer drill with at least an 8-12"" concrete drill bit to get through the rocks underneath the surface. I ended up wrecking 3 pegs. The camp has free gas bbq's, toilets, showers & troughs to hand-wash your clothes. There are no clotheslines, so bring a rope & pegs. There is also a kiosk which is opened from 10am-4pm where you can get limited drinks & food. Ormiston Gorge is a ""MUST"" to visit when in the Alice Springs area of the Northern Territory. 9/10"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Wonderful place. If you love the untouch nature, this is the place. The gorge is beautiful and the pond walk is very nice. You feel so peaceful there. And the little kiosk/cafe has got some great stuffs too. Worth getting a delicious ice coffee after the walk. I will be back again someday."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We were driving from Kings Canynon back to Alice Springs and tries to stop in at all the scenic spots. This was our first on the way and wow. What a beautiful scenic water hole. We wished we had swimwear and time to have a dip. well worht a look for the beautiful rock formations and pictureseque water hole. Ideal picnic spot for a day. Looks pretty good for kids too.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This is the definite choice for a swim break in the West Mc Donnell Ranges. But it is also much more than that. The gorge itself is exquisite and very deep. There are many walks starting from the parking. Since we were in a rush we only went to the lookout but the place deserves more time.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge is stunning part of NT, with a really serene waterhole. I recommend staying at the campsite there. Our stay at Ormiston Gorge meant a swim in the waterhole, where clear, cool waters were framed by a serene red rock face with caves leading to a magnificent gorge. There are only three colours out here; orange, blue and green, the varying shades of these are determined by the ripples in the water and the shadows marking the time of day. The campsite isn't as busy as other campsites, so there's a chance you'll find some peace and quiet. It has all the amenities necessary to hookup a caravan- a charging station, bathroom block. And the sky is so clear. Because there's less light pollution around Ormiston Gorge, as there is, say in Alice, you can see a blanket of stars."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Probably the best walk we have been on. It took us 3 hours but we were walking quickly. It is a very stoney walk and had a few boulders to climb over in the creek bed. So much variety and the scenery is spectacular. A ranger told us it was voted the best walk in Central Australia. Highly Recommended. A must.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"There are very few places where you can just sit and listen to the world turn, but this is one of them. Find a nice shady spot and let the wide open sky blow your cares away."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"It's not often these days that you go somewhere and there are no man made sounds. This is one of those rare places. Being able to swim in this natural billabong, amid towering red cliffs is an amazing experience, in fact probably the highlight of our visit to the West Macdonell Ranges. The water is cold and the sand gets hot, so bring shoes. Plenty of shade. It is an easy, short walk from the car park and has toilets and a basic kiosk. If you are quiet and observant there is a variety of wildlife to be seen. There are also a number of longer, more strenuous walks available but do not underestimate how difficult these can be in the heat. Always take plenty of water!! Go for a swim, read a book in the shade, relax and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. If you are out that way, I highly recommend you stop for a visit. It's a unique experience, you won't regret it."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge is located in West MacDonnell Ranges, more or less 135 km far from Alice Springs. Really this attraction is a gorge in the middle of the beautiful and red rock of MacDonnell Ranges. Here there is beautiful clear sand and you can walk in three different walks (a short walk about 20 minutes to the first lookout, a medium walk about 2 hours to walk around and to go to the top of the gorge, and a large walk about 5 hours to arrive to the Glen Helen Gorge included in Larapinta Trail) and you can bathe in the water near the gorge. Always you can see wonderful strange views of the rocks. In fact, it seems that you are in another planet. Moreover, if you are lucky, you can see wallabies or other fauna of the Australia Outback. It is fantastic, great! A very recommendable excursion! (see also Emily and Jessie Gaps and Trephine Gorge in East MacDonnell Ranges, and Flynn Dr. Grave, Simpsons Gap, Standley Chasm, Ellery Creek Big Hole, Serpentine Gorge, Ochre Pits and Glen Helen Gorge in West MacDonell Ranges)"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A wonderful place but if you are going to do the Pound Walk leave plenty of time and be well prepared for the heat and clambering over the rocks in the gorge
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We hiked along the dry gorge with its beautiful scenery. The hike is suitable for all ages. The dry river with its water holes makes for some stunning scenery. If you are patient you can see the Rock Wallabies. You can add some spice to the hike by taking a track which requires scrambling over large boulders. Which ever hike you do, you will be surprised at the beautiful scenery."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Wonderful walking and helpful national park staff. We also enjoyed an evening of pizza under the stars followed by a slide show and talk by one of the wardens. There is also a great camp ground attached.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Do the short walk along the ghost gum path and into the gorge, simply stunning. The pound walk took us about 4 hours (we did stop for photos) and is probably best done with a guide who can point out the geology. If you do the pound walk you exit through the gorge. Lovely café with great coffee. Great bird life."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This Gorge is about 4kms from Glen Helen Resort. The gorge itself has a selection of walks with varying degrees of difficulty. We did the walk up to the lookout over the gorge and then continued to climb down to the valley. This was a moderate walk and involved a lot of scrambling over rocks especially down in the valley. It's best to start early in the morning as it can get very hot and this walk doesn't offer much shade until you get to the valley. You can swim in the gorge but even in summer it's very very cold! There is a much welcomed kiosk which opens at 10am and they sell a variety of drinks including decent coffee. They also do some tasty snacks. You can even recharge your phone and devices. There are toilet facilities too. Be sure to take plenty of water if going on the longer walks. The gorge itself was beautiful and we even spotted a rock wallaby.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"One of the more stunning aspects of the Larapinta Ranges and trail is Ormiston Pound and Gorge. Although campers are a bit squished in at the caravan park and the amenities block has limited facilities the walks are near by so there is no need to drive any distance for the activities. A cafe offers some good meal and coffee choices, especially welcomed by hungry walkers on the trail. The pound walk is stunning and not as difficult as other walks in the area, and the Gorge easier to negotiate."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The landscape around Ormiston Gorge is incredible to look at. This was our last stop before joining the Mereenie Loop to Kings Canyon & was definitely worth the effort. There is a kiosk & toilet facilities available in the car park / picnic area so if you have forgotten anything then this is your chance. Being in the dryer part of the year the water levels were significantly down based on the high water markings on the rocks. this would be really spectacular when full of water.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Do the pound walk, it was spectacular. The suggested timings were about right, make the effort to go up the lookout branch of the trail, you will be rewarded with amazing views of the pound. The walk ends in the gorge. Camp ground in good condition with good facilities, possibly a bit cramped but great location."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Stunning landscape. We dropped in here on the way back to Alice from Glen Helen. Surprisingly a cafe at the carpark..kids appreciated an ice cream!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Each of the landforms in this area is so unique that it is not a case of 'seen one, seen then all.' The walk in is not challenging."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Ormiston Gorge is one of those places you must not miss.It is an easy walk in as well as a very scenic walk.We watched the Rock Wallabies and a great array of birdlife.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A magical place, my favourite waterhole in the West Macdonnell Ranges. Easily reachable from Alice for a day visit, but really it's worth taking a couple of days out of your schedule to camp there. The campground is small but well maintained with hot showers and gas bbqs. There's also a small kiosk open during the day, and they have pizza nights on Wednesdays and Saturdays (I think). So stay, do the pound walk and the ghost gum walk, or wander through the gorge, but most importantly stop, unwind, drink in the silence, watch the birds, dingos and kangaroos and truly experience this special place."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,When in Ormiston gorge you must do the full walk up over the top of the gorge and then down and back through the gorge it is just a fantastic walk with great views great pictures great everything. My little girl aged four and had no problems walking around it took us just over an hour so much fun plenty of fun pictures and the walk back through the gorge is just fantastic everyone who visits Alice Springs must go here
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"a beautiful, restful gorge, not far from Alice Springs. We walked to it both at the end of a walk (from the Finke River) and also a complete circle, through the gorge. Not too long, and wear good walking shoes if you walk the whole way!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Beautiful Gorge with differing red rock and vegetated areas, options of varied walks and a lot of what you would expect in the red centre. The longer pound walk giving you a range of experiences and views from along the sides and in the gorge areas, across the flatter areas to the ridge lookouts allowing you to sit and take in the large and spectacular and differing ridges and lowlands. Walks from 20 minutes to 4 hour plus - options."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"What a great spot. Camping with hot showers and free gas burners and bbqs. And there's a kiosk serving a good range of food, drinks ( proper coffee) sandwiches, cakes, pies & pizzas two nights a week. Great walking also."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The walk up Mt Sonder is great and the gorge is a bonus. The views and in particular the fascinating topography are well woth the effort.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"If you are travelling out along the ranges - definitely drop in for this one, you can either do a 60 min return walk - very steep climb or simply walk along the floor for an easy 10 min walk, it was so serene and great photo opportunity."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"should have stayed at Ormiston gorge, facilities looked great, toilets, showers and a café selling hot and cold food. Very friendly staff. They really wanted to make everyone feel welcome."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"It is easy to loose a few hours here as there is plenty to see and do. If you tire of walking and exploring then either laze on the ""beach"" or take a swim. The water was ridiculously cold, so just jump in and enjoy. Great place to chill out"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Didnt know what to expect but so glad we took the time to go in, magical spot and great kiosk as well"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We are on a trip doing 28 walks in 9 weeks taking in South Australia, the Red Centre, The Jatbula walk out of Katherine. We then travel the length of WA and back to SA then home. So far the Ormiston Pound and Gorge walk has been the best. You walk on the outside for a while then enter the pound. There are superb views. You cross the Pound and then walk down the gorge. WOW is the only way to describe it. Stunning geology, flora and views. You finish of at a lovely waterhole, with people swimming and kayaking. From there you walk up to the kiosk and have a lovely Toastie and coffee or one of a great selections of Focaccia's. They also sell meat packs from Milner's Meats in Alice. we bought some camel and date sausages, which were superb. I cannot recommend this walk highly enough."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The Ormiston gorge was beautiful. It was tranquil. You can do a bushwalk if you want or just walk into the gorge. Lovely photos.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This was probably my favourite of all the truly amazing places we saw along the West McDonnell ranges. We had a welcome but unremarkable lunch at the kiosk but the gorge was idyllic.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,The pound walk at Ormistoon Gorge is a wonderful way of seeing the amazing variation of landscape of Australia's Center. the four hours is easily acheived but take water and food to ensure you can take your time and enjoy the views and wonderfull sights.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Many years ago, this was a place I'd visit while in boarding school in the Alice. It was definitely not like it is now with a kiosk and good bathroom facilities, camping grounds and picnic facilities. This place, while frolicking in the water, climbing the rocks, running through the dry riverbed, partaking in BBQs while trying not to be annoyed by flies...this place will always hold a special place in my heart. It has always been a favourite of mine. The water, the sand, the rocks (slippery they can be) and the scenery all round is truly amazing. There is now a lookout you can go up to on the hill, so you can gain a birds-eye view of the Gorge. I never got to do that as I didn't have enough time, but I'd end up recommending walking through the gorge and seeing it from above if you visit. Both I am sure will be spectacular in your eyes I'm sure."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"An easy walk to the end of the gorge rewards you with a lovely deep water hole where the colours and textures of the gorge behind is reflected. The many colours here are a delight with red, blue and purple rocks along with the big old red river gums."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A great walk around the Pound the last kilometer is a challenge for us oldies, the water hole is brilliant only 5 minutes from the Kiosk. We stayed in the campground 3 nights 420 per night unpowered but hot showers and flush toilets. The Kiosk was a surprise as we enjoyed a great Pizza (wed and sat only). Excellent spot."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A short walk into Ormiston Gorge with its beautiful Ghost Gums, Water Hole, Mountainous Rock Formations, sand, sheer beauty. We went back for a second visit and walked a steep incline to have a wonderful view of the Gorge. There is a cafe available and we enjoyed an iced coffee after our walk. The owner was helpful and cheerful. Toilets and areas available for a picnic. Also camping available."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Had the pleasure of staying at the wonderful campgrounds at Ormiston Gorge. Despite having a big rig we managed to find a suitable site and throughly enjoyed some of the cleanest facilities ever. The pound walk is wonderful, but the highlight was the pizza night in the kiosk followed by the ranger talk on Wednesday nights. Nick and Beck were very friendly hosts. The kiosk is well stocked with bread, milk, meat packs etc. I was craving a good coffee as hadn't had 1 in a while, surprisingly was the best coffee since we left home. Great place to stay that we could not recommend more highly."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"""Ormiston Gorge"" is a beautiful spot. You will enjoy your visit, the road in is sealed and there is plenty of car parks.There are a few walks you can do, the Ghost Gum Walk is wonderful with concrete steps and a well maintained track leading up to the top and all the way there are stunning views all around and back towards the ranges,once at the top there is a viewing platform which looks out across the gorge the views are stunning.Then make your way back down to the waterhole,where you can swim but they say the water is very cold, and the most beautiful ghost gums, and amazing rock formations.This really is a beautiful place to visit.Hope you enjoy your visit as much as we did."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"What gorgeous surroundings, some lovely low level walks and also some great view points. Also a lot of wildlife...or so we were told."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A must see gorge, absolutely beautiful and full of wonder. Amazing how it has been formed over the millennium. A special mention to the people at the Kiosk, especially a young lady named Lara. Upon arriving after a full days walking we were greeted by her friendly smile and asked her lots of questions. Nothing was too much trouble, she allowed us to us the phone to make a couple of urgent calls. We needed to have a food box dropped to our Alice Springs Hotel and she offered to do it at no cost to us, we were so appreciative of this. We also enjoyed the Pizza Night, we thoroughly recommend them! Thank you once again Lara!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Such a treat for 12 ravenous bushwalkers to come out of a 9-day walk in the Chewings Range and fall upon Nick and Bec's pizzas. 8 were demolished in quick time, plus decent coffees from a proper espresso machine The following night several members had the BBQ packs, and especially enjoyed the camel & date snags. Both Nick and Bec looked after us well, and we had fun playing with their kids"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,What a joy to see and experience though if u go on the scenic trip to the lookout and continue on to the riverbed be advised that there is much scrambling and climbing over rocks and boulders but totally enjoyable and different
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Very pretty and well maintained walk suffering the affects of many many visitors. I thought that the kiosk looked good. Price quirky and clean. Open fireplace in the outdoor area might be a nice spot for campers to sit round. Coffee awful. Hot chic ok. Camp site looked good. Grassy but on a slight slope which can be annoying. We helped an old fella back to the kiosk after a fall in the gorge and the staff were most attentive and helpful with first aid. Loos very clean and well appointed. Not sure if there were showers as we only day tripped
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Stayed here a few days at the camping area ($10 per person per night) many of the sites are sloping but we were lucky having sites 9 and 10. Did the Pound walk which is amazing and well worth the effort. Be warned though the last Km or so is rough and lots of boulder hopping. Probably is worthy of a higher ranking than a moderately difficult walk.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"What seems to be the biggest gorge in the West Macs. There are plenty of walks, you could spend the whole day there if you want. Plenty of parking and a good, smooth wheelchair accessible path down to the main waterhole. If you don't want to do the whole circuit you can do the ghost gums lookout walk. About 1.5km's, takes about 1.5hr. It has a steep first section with many steps but the view from the lookout is excellent. The second part is a more gentle slope and has no steps but is quite rough. The walk along the river bed can be a bit of a slog - either soft sand or clambering over boulders. Walks are best for the fit. There's a shop at the car park, selling drinks and snack food. Also clean toilets."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Only a couple of hours out of Alice Springs, definitely a must see if you are in the region. Preferably worth an overnight trip even though the accommodation at Glen Helen is quite basic. A beautiful location and if you can do the Pound Walk, even better. The walk is some 8 km.and although they suggest a time of 3-4 hours, it can be quite arduous and if are a bird watched and stop and enjoy the species, then perhaps, it can take 6 or 7 hours."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Do not go to alice springs without making the trip here. The place is amazing. This was my second time and it was as good the second time round!
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Loved this short walk, the waterhole was picture perfect, shame we couldn't go for a swim. Worth a walk to the lookout as the scenery is spectacular."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A five minute walk from the car park to the most beautiful lagoon I have ever seen. Surrounded by ghost gums and mountains, absolutely amazing place. Spend the day there picnicing and swimming. Constructed pathways suitable for disabled and prams, surrounded by rock retaining walls. Kiosk facilities and toilets and bbqs and very friendly staff at kiosk. Would highly recommend this amazing place."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A lovely and varied 2hr plus walk that gives you a real feel for the landscape, winding over the hills and then back along the river bank and through the gorge (add on the 'Ghost gum look out for an aerial view of the gorge). There is wading at the end, though slightly anticlimatic compared to the warnings as the river was warm and - at the time I visited - only came up to thigh height, but I guess it depends on the time of year. Mostly well signed throughout, but a refreshingly less 'organised' than many in the park and much less busy than Kings Canyon rim"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Took the Ghost Gum trail. Walking the circular trail counter clockwise, you climb about 100' up, following a train that is well established, most of the up hill sections are concrete steps making the walking easy. It took about 15 minutes to leisurely make it to the top where there is a large overlook deck. The views of the gorge and surroundings is well worth the 15 minutes to hike. We continued on with the trail, descending in the gorge, stopping many times to watch geckos and lizards on the trail. Making it down to the river bed, the rocks change into this wonder purple hue. It is interesting to see Gum trees growing on a rock ledge with no apparent source of water. The entire trek around took 1.5 hours, but a good portion of that was watching the birds, animals, and scenery."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge and Pound covers nearly five thousand hectares of scenic MacDonnell Ranges wilderness. It has a deep passage carved through a quartzite range by floodwater of Ormiston Creek. The permanent waterhole which lies at the Gorge’s southern end is spectacular, just like the other permanent waterholes of the West MacDonnell Ranges."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This place is worth the stop. It takes about 1-3/4 hours to drive there from Alice Springs. The trails lead to a lovely watering hole and big eucalyptus trees. There are picnic areas and bathroom facilities here. If you're in the area for a long time, you could easily spend all day here. We were checking out the MacDonnell Ranges over one day...so our time here was limited. Even an hour is enough time to drink in the beauty and snap a few photos."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We were a group of 8 walking at end of sept. 4 adults and 4 children ranging from 9-4 years. Walk was great. Quite tiring for the kids and a lot of big boulders towards the end. There is a sign at the start that says you will walk through cold water towards end but I didn't expect to get my bottom wet. Water was very cold but quite refreshing after walking for 4 hours. Kids thought it was great.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We day tripped to the Gorge from Alice Springs. Well worth it. Lovely spot. Morning or evening is best. We had a little rock wallaby sit beside us (about 10 feet away) while we were sitting there absorbing the view. the colours of the rock are impressive against the water.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"A stunning natural attraction that required a bit of (pretty easy) walking. Wonderful colours of the surrounding scenery and sky; it was lovely simply sitting on the little beach soaking up the quiet atmosphere (until a large noisy family came and plonked themselves next to us!). Not much shade, so morning visit advised."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Walking on the tack is good, but lying on the little beach and reading a book, watching the light change and forgetting about your travel itinerary for a few hours (at least 3!) is the way to go."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,throw in your togs and towels on this easy walk from the carpark. Such a pristine environment and within reach of a young family like ours
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Had no idea this was out here - a friend from Alice took us there. Saw a dingo as we pulled in, took a lovely walk and even braved the freezing water and went for a swim. Kids enjoyed playing in the sand. Great spot"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This was by far my favourite gorge and walk in this region. The Pound walk was absolutely fantastic - took about 2.5 hours done anti-clockwise, which is the best way. Do the little extra to the lookout (5-10 mins) after the saddle for breath taking views into the Pound. Fantastic colours in the cliffs. The last kilometre into the Gorge involves rock hopping over or around large boulders. When we did it we had to wade through chest deep very cold water for about 10 metres but this was ok as the ground was sandy underneath. We also did the shorter walk above the Gorge which was good value too. Surprised to find warm showers and an excellent kiosk/ café in the camping area. Not many van spaces there, so may get full at times. Beware of very tame dingos that will steal shoes / food left outside. Could do this on a long day trip from Alice but better to camp and cook or book a meal at nearby Glen Helen resort."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston gorge has one of the very few permanent water holes in the Fink River. It is an easy 150 odd metre walk from the paved car-park, along an easy track to the water hole at the first part of the gorge. The water is cold but very refreshing to walk across the shallows to get access further up the gorge. This is a bit harder as you walk along the sandy river bank for about 100 metres and then over some rocky ground to get a good view up the gorge. Well worth the extra 10 minute walk. There are trails that hikers can take for longer adventures if you are that way inclined."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Loved the gorge, the walks, the café for much needed coffee travelling back Alice Springs from Glen Helen via Ochre pits (fantastic). Met a delightful chap from Darwin who had met three backpackers in the Alice and was giving them an outback experience...camping under the stars. True Australian spirit."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,We loved the gorges all different natural wonders. There was good car parking at all the major gorges and easy access.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Camped three nights whilst group walked Larapinta Trail. Good facilities and a very friendly and totally professional ranger (Nick) on site. Very knowledgeable about local area.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Like most parks managed by The NT Parks service, this was a pleasure to visit. Beautiful scenery, good signage and pathways, and an excellent cafe within the park. Allow at least 2 hours to enjoy this special place."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge is a wonderful place but if you are interested in doing the walks, allow some time. There was a bit of water in the gorge while we were there so the last bit of the track you had to choose between climbing down a steep rock or getting wet. Most people walked into the Gorge which is only a 5 minute walk and also then walked up to the lookout and then came back down rather than doing the complete circuit walk. The road is sealed all of the way and is easily accessible from Alice and back in a day. There is a nice little kiosk for drinks and food."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Do yourself a favour - Get out here even if you have to hitch-hike. The natural beauty of Ormiston Gorge and and the West McDonnell Range in general beats all others.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"My family (5 & 8 yr old and wife) and I day tripped from Alice. It was a long-ish day but well worth the effort. We did the pound walk (anti-clockwise) and WOW...!!! When you come over a rise and it is all in front of you.....no picture can do this justice. The kids loved the rock hopping and the wildlife....birds, lizards and wallabies. The kiosk at the end for a coffee/hot choc was a nice way to end. Super nice...we got back just after 4pm as they were about to close and he was more than happy to tend to 4 weary walkers. Very happy."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Ormiston Gorge was incredible. We walked up to the lookout which was much easier than I thought and what a view! Our 6 and 9 year olds were even impressed. It was too cold to swim in the water - maybe in Summer I would have. Lots to see and do and they even had flushing toilets. The West Macs need robe on everyone's bucket list. No photos or explanations do it justice. You need to see it for yourself.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We went on foot to this oasis of peace and serenity at the end of a long day bouncing around in the back of our little tour bus. What a pleasure --- no commercial 'assets' at all, just amazing peace and quiet in a pristine environment with lots of black-tailed wallabies camouflaged against the rocks near the waterhole. You will not see them until they move then it's ""there's another one, and another, oh look, so many of them""."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"My hubby and I were lucky enough to visit this beautiful part of Australia. I heard a lady describe it as the most beautiful place in Australia and I was not disappointed. There's a kiosk at the campground, where you can get 'the best espresso west of Alice' , according to Nick from Northcote. The kiosk is not open in the low season.The landscape is spectacular. The permanent waterhole is a place to swim and relax and is a short walk from the campground. just beware of the frogs who live in the smaller waterholes...the toilets! They will look at you but disappear when you need to go! So cute!"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,One of the few places in the MacDonnells where you will find permanent water. Fabulous for taking photos.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"It was quite a trek to the actual Gorge but well worth it in the end. You need good shoes on, trainers are fine."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,i have done most of the gorges on the namitjira drive and this has to be the most beautiful scenic one of them all. it is magnificent. make sure you take your camera. it is part of the larapinta trail and there are yellow footed rock wallabies in the gorge to see if you look hard.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Simpson's Gap was the best (and closest) of the gorges and walks. Standley Chasm was awful, and you had to pay to go on the walk. Ormiston had dirty green water and wasn't that fantastic. The morning light at Simpson's Gap and the walk up the sandy creek bed was beautiful."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Done the Ormiston Gorge Helicopter flight with a very friendly and professional Irish Pilot in June 13- FANtastic! Highly recommend it! Barbara and Marc
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We where in a group of four and went on the 20 minute helicopter flight over Glen Helen and Ormiston Gorge with Cathal (Carl) the pilot, two people at a time..the view and the pilot where amazing..the best view ever and good commentary from Cathal (Carl) WELL worth the $145 each..fabulous"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A 5 minute stroll from the carpark leads to a wonderful swimming hole surrounded by red rock cliffs and the odd white gum. On a hot day (and there are plenty in this part of the world) this is just the ticket. The water is deep in places so perhaps not a good idea for little children or those who can't swim. There are other walks to explore that are probably best left for the cooler weather. This is also a great place for a picnic.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We stopped on our last day on our way back to Alice Springs Airport, and walked the Ghost Gum walk up to the lookout. We were lucky to see a rock wallaby and joey on the rocks. They stayed and let us take lots of photos. Tremendous views from the lookout. Quite a steep walk up. We walked down the the gorge which is also amazing. There are great facilities here. Would consider camping here next time - flushing toilets and visitors centre."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We loved this magnificent place, our children swam in the gorge, we walked the Ghost Gum walk up to a spectacular, high lookout over the whole area (walk was suitable for school children.. and our 3 year old was fine too). We camped here ($25 for a family), there are bbqs, stoves, flushing toilets, showers and rubbish bins (all very clean)."
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This is a super walking trail – highly recommended for hikers!!! I was there in July 2012 and completed the circuit. Towards the southern end of the Ormiston Gorge, need to wade through an icy waterhole to get back to the Visitor Centre. My account and photos are in http://mntviews.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/ormiston-gorge-nt-australia.html"
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A must do and explore walk through ormiston gorge andppound the wild fauna and flora afte rthe rains is a brilliant display.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,One of the best gorges in this area and a fabulous opportunity for photograph. On a hot day you can even jump in for a swim. Very easy access and well with a trip.
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"If my God told me that I was going to die at a certain period of time in the future and asked me where I wanted to be when it happened, then there is a little lookout just above the Glen Helen Homestead overlooking the Western McDonnell Ranges where I would want to be at sunset. Very apt. The Ranges sprawl out to the east and west , the air is crisp and clean and the sun paints itts colours on the mountains in the most wonderful and touching way. I have been there many times, often with a glass of bubbly or a beer and just been blown away by the sheer majesty of the vista."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We went to Katherine Gorge and canoed for 4 1/2 hours and it was amazing. only did a couple of the gorges you can do more depending on your fitness level. We were amazed by the first gorge, we were allowed to swim and yes we did see fresh water crocs on the side. Would definitely do it again."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Enjoy what mother nature has left for us. It is truely a magical place, at every turn was a photograph moment. You can hike, canoe or boat trip thru the gorges. Pack a lunch and enjoy your day. Leave only your footprints and take away your rubbish and memories."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did the 2 hour cultural tour with Susie and her team, which we'd booked only 2 days earlier at the visitors centre. Susie and Tony generously shared their knowledge about Jawoyn country in a really engaging way. We practiced some weaving, which left us in awe of the skill of traditional weavers. Don't be discouraged if the online booking doesn't work. It was so wonderful to hear directly from traditional custodians. A must do. Thank you Susie and Tony."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Did the southern walks today, left from the boat ramp car park, walked the look out overlooking the boat area and seeing the 17mile creek on the other side. I found out you should start from the day visitor area so the maps make sense. I found looking at the maps like looking at scrambled eggs, they are a mixture of bike tracks walking tracks all mixed together making no sense, the bike tracks are blue looking like a river. If I had taken time to download the app it would have been easier. The tracks are indigenous names so it makes it even harder to work out for most people. Did the southern rockhole and pats look out, it’s about 800m down stairs and lots of rock climbing to get to the bottom and takes it out of you in the heat, passed a big rock pool near the bottom then to the river with a nice sand bank and trees, well worth the effort but you can’t swim hear. Walked to Jeddas rock then to butterfly gorge, it’s only about 1.5 klms in but seems take for ever, nice and cool near the bottom. Had a refreshing swim for 20 minutes sharing with a handful of other walkers. After a long hot walk it really helped to cool off for the march out to the car. It was a good walk but don’t like walking on wide road tracks on the way out maybe 6klm or more, it was a lot of walking near the road back to the boat ramp car park. The butterfly walk area plus a swim in the gorge was really the best part, maybe take a noodle or blow up float for a bit of extra safety in the water"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"A must do when in the area! Lots of things to do, both on land and water. We enjoyed hiking and a canoe trip on through the gorges on Katherine river. The national park is well worth to spend some time in, and you can choose wether to spend a day or several. The government of NT has imposed a fee for tourists visiting the park. It has to be payed online before visiting, and the price is a bit steep. I wish they would have made it a bit easier to pay, maybe at the visitors center?"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),It needs to be seen to understand how beautiful it is. We did the look out during a down pour and it was still incredible.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We enjoyed Nitmiluk with the cruise in the gorge and on the same day from a helicopter. Such an amazing location. There are walking tracks too.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Have stayed at Nitmiluk National Park (Nitmiluk Tours/Katherine Gorge campgrounds) for the past 3 nights. The grounds are nice, we are staying in the long rig powered sites and its been quite due to COVID so it has been great having lots of space. Dinner by the poolside last night was good and well priced. What lets this park down and will stop me visiting again is the state of the toilet blocks, their disgusting. They have not been cleaned since we arrived and according the the cleaning schedule on the wall it was last cleaned in March 2020. Their is no toilet paper left, has been no hand wash since we arrived and its very very dirty. During a COVID crisis you would think hygiene would be paramount, clearly not here. We have travelled all through the NT from Darwin to the Red centre and are on our way back - I would rate these toilets as bad as some of the roadhouse/servo stops we stopped at on our travelles such as Elliot. I'm a Terittorian and the state of these toilets is just embarrassing! Clean your toilets Nitmiluk Tours and restock your bloody toilet paper and hand soap.......its not hard."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The Nitmiluk National park is an absolute gem, 9 different gorges to visit and paddle through (with some portaging depending on the water level), so beautiful! Not many places to kayak inland in the Top End, this is the spot, a few hours to a few days of back country camping and kayaking, Nitmiluk has it. Great swimming throughout too!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Plan on going early as it gets hot and there are sections with little or no shade. But the views are spectacular and well worth the effort. There are spots where you can get close to the river but you have to be wary as crocks inhabit the area. There are many photo opportunities Wear good hiking shoes and take plenty of water. Sunscreen is a must as well as insect repellent during the wet. We had a great time and sitting on the deck at the coffee shop sipping an ice cold locally made all natural iced coffee was the perfect cap to the day.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"A lovely area in the Top End. Interesting landscapes and beautiful gorges. Katherine gorge is a highlight for sure. Deep red stones, lots of water. The NP is great to explore, camp and visit. Camp grounds are excellent. Lots of wallabies around."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Nitmiluk National Park is such a beautiful, relaxing and peaceful place to visit. The beauty of the gorge is just stunning, everywhere you looked took my breath away. This is a must see when visiting Katherine. Our tour guide spoke of the history of the gorge and the Traditional Owners of this area. We did the walk one day, which was hard and then came back the next day to do the river cruise. Thank you:)"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),The young people on this tour looked after us all very well and worked hard at ensuring we all had a great evening
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),This is a great place to visit on a tour. While you are waiting you can get lunch at the great cafe and also read about the place at the visitor centre. You can either sit inside or outside while you eat.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I highly recommend this park. The staff at the visitor center is helpful giving specific detailed information about day hiking, answering lots of questions, and gave us good this. It's nice to sit outside and enjoy the Katherine River with grand vistas. The visitor center has a cafe. The day hiking provided good walks with well marked trails with very good message boards including a color coded trail map. The trails were very well maintained and constructed given what I can only imagine it would be like in the rainy season. Their tip was to take a picture of the map on the message board was one I will use in other parks. Good bird viewing. Jawoyn and Dagomen people are the Aboriginal owners who have leased this back to the nation."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did a few of the hiking trails in one go and it was stunning scenery but thought I would review with a few tips. It’s all self guided and there are tons of maps around the car park so it’s quite hard to get lost as long as you stay on the paths; there is also public toilets and plenty of room for picnics so ensure to bring a backpack with snacks and heaps of water as there aren’t a lot of water pumps around there that I could see. Also bring a hat coz even though we went in dry season, it does get really hot as there isn’t much shade (being the Aussie bushland). We hiked up to the Baruwei lookout which is breathtaking and well worth the climb, just be a aware for little kids and older people - it’s very steep and you have to really take your time so ensure to wear enclosed shoes and keep hands free. Once up there, plenty of places to sit and enjoy the view and take some amazing photos - there isn’t any fences though so small kids keep a hold of. We then followed the trail around to southern rockhole - now this trail is fairly easy but again for kids / older people I wouldn’t recommend unless fit. Sounthern rockhole you literally have to climb down rocks and a lot of it is loose so be careful and wouldnt take kids under 5 down there. The waterfall was dry when we went as it is dry season but imagine it would be stunning in wet season! Still nice to sit and relax before the climb back up but wouldn’t swim there as the water is stagnant. Not far from the rockhole is “pats lookout” which is worth the extra little climb as you can see the whole gorge! Amazing place for photos and to enjoy some food. Just make sure to take all your rubbish as there are bins at the car park! There a lot of longer trails but those two were enough for us! Just watch your footing and ensure to wear thick socks as you end up walking a lot more then planned. Highly recommend for the adventurous!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),This is a lovely area and we stayed at the camp ground which gave easy access to the cruises that go through Katherine Gorge. It is easy to get to from Katherine.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Having had to upgrade to include a remote landing because the two other people wanted to land (extra $42) I was told take off would be 1.30. We were there by 1.00 and then got told that we were being given a 4.00pm flight. Not happy Jan as we had intended driving to Litchfield after the flight. Very unhelpful Mac! I did tell you at the time too!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Nitmiluk is all about the gorges and what better way to see them than by rowing yourself in a canoe!! There are quite a number of gorges and depending on your fitness and tour option, some would be able to reach the fifth gorge. Your tour starts off with a ferry ride on the first gorge when there is an open commentary which will give you a brief background on the history and evolution of the area. Upon arrival at the second gorge, you will have to take a short walk to an area where you'll be assigned your canoe and given the rest of your gear. You can opt for a full day or half day - the latter you can choose to depart in the morning or afternoon. Once you are in your canoe, the pace is all up to you. It is relatively easy paddling both ways as there is only a very light current. You're given about 3.5 hours with the canoes - just remember that you'll have to paddle back the way you came so bear in mind the time. There is only 1 ferry back at 5pm so even if you arrive back early or had enough, you'll have to wait for the rest of your crew to return. I went as a family of 4 with young kids and we opted to just take it easy - enjoying the scenery and serenity. We managed to complete the entire course of the second gorge but decided to take a breather while the rest of the group went on ahead to the third. Bring lots of water as well but the ferry and the canoe docking area all have drinking water available to top up your bottles. We arrived back about 45 minutes early and was pleasantly surprised to find out that there was some rock art at the beginning of the second gorge. It will require you to navigate through the rocks separating the first and second gorge. On the way back, the ferry captain spotted a freshwater crocodile and did a u-turn for everyone to catch a glimpse. Overall a very enjoyable time with the family! Totally recommend it and well worth the money spent!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This national park offers a great variety of boat, canoe, and even helicopter tours to help visitors explore the Katherine Gorge system, but I came away most impressed with the extensive trail system, if only because I hadn't expected it. A relative novice, or anyone with more enthusiasm than time, can scramble up right from the picnic area to an overlook with a commanding view of the first gorge, and a look far up Seventeen Mile Valley, in an hour or less, there-and-back, or continue on the Baruwei Loop for a two-hour walk that returns you to the picnic area. There are helpful and informative signs everywhere. At the other end of the skills spectrum, an experienced, well-equipped backpacker can take 2-3 days to tramp all the way to the eighth gorge, maybe adding a stop to see Jawoyn paintings on the rocky outcroppings of the valley named for these native people, who are the original inhabitants and still the owners of these lands, which are leased to the government for use as a national park. And there is everything in-between: walks of 3-8 hours -- some moderate, others more difficult -- that have overlooks and in some cases seasonal swimming holes, with drinking water and toilets available along most routes. If a multi-day walk interests you, and you haven't got camping gear, you can arrange to stay in one of the permanent tent sites or, if you'd like to splurge, there are chalets and the Cicada Lodge, where you can dine sumptuously on 3 courses paired with wine (although be forewarned: this does not come cheap, with double rooms at the Lodge about AUS$ 500/US$350 and dinner-with-wine AUS$140/US100; chalets are less expensive, around AUS$300/US$210 for 2 bedrooms). Basically, there is something here for everyone, at every fitness and experience level, and suitable for all pocketbooks, from camping for 3 bucks a night (honor system) to a luxury stay at the lodge. But best all, to my mind, are the helpful and knowledgeable people who work here, including some who are native peoples with a lifetime of experiences in this unique environment. This park is very well staffed, and everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful, eager to make my experience here an extraordinary and memorable one. They will do the same for you. I found them to be among the most dedicated national park employees I have encountered in the many foreign forays I have made to such places. Conditions here vary greatly by season, and not all facilities are open year-round. So be sure to check online for opening/closing dates for all lodgings. Following weather reports and trends is also essential, especially if you are planning to hike the longer, more difficult tracks, some of which require specialized equipment and skills because they are only lightly marked and may be very rough and/or very steep. For good info on the entire trail system, you can request a copy of the information sheet for ""Nitmiluk National Park Southern Walks"" or search for it online. It contains brief, essential information on length, degree of difficulty, special sights, and inter-connections for 8 park trails, along with a clear explanation of the Australian Walking Track Grading System so that you will better understand the precise meaning of ""easy,"" ""moderate"" and ""difficult,"" as you plan your visit. Highly Recommended."

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did a day walk to some of the southern gorges in preparation for our Jatbula walk this week. The nitmiluk gorge itself is stupendous but expect to be overlooked and buzzed by helicopters, and to hear the constant noise of boat touring up and down the gorges. As you go to the boat jetty, you’ll hear the flying foxes adding to the cacophony. The national parks centre is currently being redeveloped so its a bit of a building site there."

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We did the 13 gorge helicopter flight over Nitmiluk & it was spectacular! We had limited time & thought this was the best way to take it in. Our pilot was very informative & knowledgable. It was mind blowing how beautiful the landscape was.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"As we were travelling on the Ghan Train our visit to Nitmuluk National park was an excursion arranged as part of train journey.

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I visited in the hot and humid of 38 degree in temperature in the month of March, thus there are few places were closed. Disappointed but the trip though long - pickup at 6am and return at 9pm same day as I did a day tour, rewarded with the beauty of nature. We visited the cemetery which was well kept, did an adventurous dip into Edith Falls also known as Leiyn for 20 minutes - the water was lukewarm and refreshing, There are some other tourists as well as local with children swimming in the same place. The cruise through the gorge was spectacular, the sunlight shine onto the rock and it varies in different shades of yellow, orange, brownish,grey. Along the way we saw crocodiles - not much and are smaller in size (i think it is due to the hot weather that they are lying low), birds of various species, flora such as lotus or perhaps is water lily as i cannot differentiate them, lots of other white, pale yellow flowers, busy taking pictures and video, and Yes wallabies and cluster of bird nest on the underlying of the rocks. The shadow of the trees and fauna on the water surface really amazing, it looks so clear yet the water seem calm and deep, the view is simply stunning especially for someone who comes from a city country. We too sighted a water buffalo and the guide did a good job on the history of the park, the names of flora and fauna, etc it is indeed a trip with increase knowledge. Would like to return for another visit during the cooler month. Thumbs up."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),An easy drive out to Edith Falls from the Stuart Highway leads you to the beautiful and scenic Edith Falls. The weather was absolutely superb on the day we went and it was just so nice to arrive and have a look around and then go for a swim.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We visited Katherine with the sole purpose to take a Nitmiluk cruise. We were not disappointed - the scenery is amazing and it is hard to know where to point the camera. Highly recommended.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Very nice scenery with excellent commentary from our guide. It can be very hot in the summer months so be aware. Also, there is a location with very old aboriginal art but in high water months it can be closed (and they don't tell you that up front - disappointed my wife). Worth the time"

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Hit the park on a 42C day and boy was it oppressive ! Too hot for the missus so left her in the shade and did the stair walk up to the Barumei Lookout which was fairly steep & taxing but the reward was well worth the effort & sweat ! A fantastic viewpoint over the Katherine River and offering sweeping views of the area. Missed the only gorge cruise that fitted out tight timetable but it was a HOT day !!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Words just don't do it. You have to see for your own eyes. Enormous beauty. We walked the trails to see views from the top and had dinner on a cruise on night to see from the bottom looking up. Any age can do both just enjoy the wonders of Nitmiluk.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We stayed for 4 nights so had plenty of time to do the walks. We visited in mid-August so the temperature was quite warm. It got up into the 30s very quickly after sunrise, especially up on the escarpment where there can be quite a bit of open ground (i.e. no shade). So our regime was to get up at sunrise, do the walks and then relax during the heat of the day. Then another stroll later on in the afternoon. Take plenty of water, wear a hat, and sturdy footwear. We really enjoyed the Baruwei Loop track and also the walk to Pat's Lookout. Lots of interesting flora and plenty of birdlife."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Here for 3 days so on goes the hiking shoes and on goes the large brimmed Akubra. There is a short walking loop ( Baruwei) that joins to the Southern Walks. These are of whatever length and difficulty you desire. All are wonderful, with respect to terrain, wildlife (birds during the heat of day) and gorge lookouts. Yes you can swim in selected places, read the signs, as Park rangers clear out all the salties so it’s safe to swim. Arrive back at the campground and collapse into the pool, wonderful. Wear good strong shoes, sun screen and a hat, take a couple of litres of water (it is available at selected places on the walks but carry your own). Enjoy our beautiful country"

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We were last here about 15 years ago, so wanted to revisit and spend a little more time. We opted for the 4 hour, Three Gorges cruise. While the 3rd gorge is only 700m long, the extra time allows people about an hour to have a swim in a safe area (some did), explore the art on the canyon wall a bit more (which we did) or even sunbake on the rocks - in the high tropics - at midday (those people were looking a bit pink!). The cruise provides a light snack (banana bread, a packet of nuts, a bottle of water and a mandarine) in a useful little pack. The gorge is impressive. Easy to see why it is used in so many tourist promotions. Having seen Jedda Rock, I'll have to watch the movie now. We had taken the 9am tour, so were back by 1pm. This gave us time to have a salad in the cafe - a very nice salad it was too! There is a nice little information display in the visitor centre as well."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Just gorgeous- some great trails and of course the stunning Katherine gorge is great to cruise Dow or fly over.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This cruise is not that well know but I know it has been around a couple of years at least. A 4.30 start and 8.30 finish, it is not cheap at $140 but totally unique and a wonderfull experience. Some walking included but it is an easy walk of no more than 600m twice. The scenery in the three gorges you visit is superb especially at that time of the day with the sun setting and beautifull reflections. The guide as informative and friendly and the boat comfortable being able to move around to take a photos.mfree chilled water supplied. The food was cooked on the boat and a choice of barramundi and prime steak for the main course. A glass of champagne and Kirsty prior dinner. The starter of crocodile (yummy), kangaroo and dips was superb. Desert was wonderfull as well. Alcohol is not included apart from the champagne but the prices were very reasonable, better than most restaurants. The fact the food is coked fresh on the boat and the superb scenery makes this a unique and wonderfull experience not to be missed."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Definitely worth doing a cruise on the gorge it’s beautiful. There is some walking between the boats to get further up the gorge but it’s an easy walk
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We visited Edith Falls which was fantastic. Do the upper pool walk as it is spectacular and the walk is easy and makes the water more attractive as it is quite cool. We then went down to Cutta Cutta caves which was a jewel in the bush. Amazing cave with stalactites and stalagmites and we even saw some pythons. Then we stayed at Nitmiluk campground right on the gorge which was excellent. Good amenities and lots of wallabies. The gorge is amazing and we did the 2 gorge dawn cruise which was well worth the money.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Incredible- thank you to the local people for allowing us the opportunity to visit! The gorge is wonderful, our guide was knowledgeable and friendly."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"A very well managed National Park. Plenty of activities to do here, from day picnic to the many bush walking tracks offering the delights of mother nature's beauty. There are some13 magnificent gorges and surrounding escarpment for you to enjoy with spectacular views in this area. You can even go canoeing or take a scenic flight. We did several tracks and wished there was more time to put in more walks."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Jamie was the Nitmiluk river boat cruise captain. Excellent commentary and approach. Very clear with instructions eg meeting points. Very informative. Really enjoyable experience. Definitely recommend cruise.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We visited the park and the visitors centre there is modern with good displays and a cafe. We did the Baruwei Walk , Butterfly Gorge and Southern Rockhole hikes which is about 20 km. You walk through varying vegetation but the main highlights are the viewing points over the Katherine river and gorges and going down the Butterfly Gorge and the Southern Rockhole. The Butterfly Gorge has a small stream running through it and there is beautiful flora along its banks. The stream finally makes its' way into Katherine Gorge. Hiking along the Southern Rockhole is really quite a rough track with a lot of boulder hopping. Eventually you reach Katherine Gorge where there is a nice swimming area if the park deems it clear of salt water crocodiles. The freshwater crocodiles are not a significant danger to humans. Overall this hike is quite challenging due to the terrain and heat. You need to take at least 2 L of water with you but there is a place to replenish on the way. Of course you can visit the lower to gorges by boat and in the second gorge kayaking is available. This is a great place to visit especially for walking and to experience the dramatic and beautiful country."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We paddled to the end of gorge 5 in a double canoe and it was worth every cent. A long day of 9 hours but not too strenuous and the gorge was cool and shady compared to the escarpment country above (we had done a 12km walk to three lookouts the previous day and it felt a lot longer in the heat). Each gorge is a different landscape with 5 being the most spectacular for us - narrow and high. A few birds and a couple of freshwater crocs were good to see, but the gorge is the star. Lots of shady lunch spots even at midday at this time of year. Beyond gorge 3 we saw only a few canoes for the whole day. The walk into butterfly gorge and lily ponds are well worth it and accessible even for half day trips (way cooler than walking in, as we found!). Some reviewers and some of the half-day canoeists on our trip have noted that the portages can be tricky and hard work. We are both around 60 and really enjoyed the challenge (as well as cooling off in the rapids). The water level in late June meant that there was flow over the rapids, but not dangerous or deep. The quickest way is through the rapids rather than over the rocks because it's generally shorter. However, we are experienced in whitewater paddling and that helps with confidence in scrambling over wet and sometimes slippery rocks. We did not have a bow rope which they give to overnight campers. Very helpful in the portages through rapids. I would ask for one or take my own next time. But if you are up for the challenge, it is hugely worthwhile and a lot of fun. The paddle distances were quite short - maybe a total of only 10-12 km for the day. It is such a different experience to be in the middle gorges and have them completely to yourself."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),What a lovely place. We really enjoyed the sunrise boat tour up the Gorge. The captain of the boat Jamie was such a great skipper and fabulous tour guide. He knew so much about the local culture and environment. He has a great sense of humour. I felt very privileged to see such beautiful country.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"When I last visited the gorge in 2008, (I've been 4 times now) I was very impressed . The reception desk and ticket sales were all managed by young Aboriginal people. The cleaner was a young aboriginal girl around about 18, and there was another young girl filling the pamphlet holders. I commented to the girl on reception that I was pleased to see so many of her own people working (having seen a sign at Ularu in that same year saying the original owners employ whites - the sign disgusted me) She proudly told me that as they have been given back control of their original country they are training all their young people in every aspect of running it as a tourist attraction. The rangers were all trained up from their own young people. The young men who drove the boat and presented all the tourist information were very proud to be doing this job. The information the guide provided was almost 3 dimensional as he would say things the old people had told him. This time though I only saw white people, who seemed to be back packers. I was part of a tour so did not go into the reception area and do not have information about that section. The young while lady who was the tour guide made some comment about it being taboo for the local indigenous people to be on the water in the gorge. I find this hard to believe as only 10 years ago it was not a problem. Dishonesty irks me - if the young indigenous people don't want to do the work why make a comment about it at all. Making up things just makes them look like liars. I bet I am not the only person to have been to the gorges more than once. I am very very sad that the ideals and great expectations of the young people working there 10 years ago has disappeared. I had told many many people how wonderful it was and how the excitement and pride of these young people working was showing faith in the future - but what happened?, where is the bright future for the next group of young people. I found this very sad. One improvement I did find though was that there are now concrete steps and metal walkways over the rocks between the two gorges. It is rather taxing just the same for someone who is not very fit - particularly in the heat of the day."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This is such an amazing national park! So rich with wildlife, the views are incredible! A definite must see for Australia!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Excellent hikes that are well marked. And you can go a very long distance if desired. Water is available in a couple locations. Hikes from 1+ hours. Beautiful scenery.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),The sheer beauty of outback Australia is something you must not miss. this National Park is where the iconic Australian film Jedda was shot in the 1950's and it still looks the same. Beautiful country!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did the 9am 3 gorges tour and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Our driver/guide was fun, very dry humour which was much appreciated and he just made the whole morning a smooth and fun experience. The place is a natural wonder. We saw a few crocs out and about and our guide made sure the boat turned around so everyone on board could see them. The swim at the end was a high point, we all jumped into the crystal clear chilly water. A lovely waterhole up in the hills with a double waterfall, no one really wanted to leave. AN EXTRA BIG THANK YOU TO THE WONDERFUL STAFF - one of our party is a coeliac (and had booked that option for the snack) but somehow the snack bags being given at the start of our trip didn;t have that option. Upon asking, we were told not to worry, they would take care of it. Along the trip, there was a shout from the back of the boat, another boat had come speeding along with a special delivery - what fun! Wonderful service and so appreciated."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We enjoyed an afternoon and morning here. We did the Barwei loop which was pleasant with a great lookout. Bit of a steep section but the path is generally even in surface. Directions are clear. The V isitors centre is great for info. The next morning we walked to the southern rock hole and Pats lookout. The lookout has a really stunning view of the Gorge 1 and 2 area. It is quite steep and uneven to Southern rockhole but still good. The water was very stagnant and uninviting in late May! Hints for walks...take water, good hats and have sunscreen!! I even use a sarong over hat to cool down!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),This area is so lovely and peaceful. The walk to the lookout is a little challenging but so worth the effort. Boat cruises are great with local guides exchanging stories.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The guide, Jamie, on this trip was absolutely superb. Understated but very knowledgeable, and with a deep feeling for his culture, and the ability to share that in an intimate way. He left us feeling that we had been sharing something really valuable - which was the case. Thanks Jamie."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Our tour took in breakfast at the visitor centre followed by a cruise of the first two gorges. Absolutely brilliant, and very informative. Wear a broad brimmed hat for protection from the thousands of flying foxes hanging overhead in the trees."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Loved the Katherine Gorge Cruise and learnt a lot. The cruise takes you though the first two gorges and is about 2 hours. You also get to see the postcard famous scenery of the outback. Our guide, Darcy, was fantastic. Learnt a lot bit unfortunately didn't spot a croc!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"If you are in the top end of the Northern Territory then plan a visit to Nitmiluk National Park. If you have the opportunity to time your visit, plan for when croc management has removed the crocs from the waters so that you can enjoy swimming and canoeing. The cruise down Katherine Gorge was scenic although we didn't have any wildlife when we were there. The visitor's center has some good displays providing information on how the local Aboriginal people have managed the land."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Don’t just stop at the visitor centre, go for one of the walks - you won’t regret it. THe staff are so helpful. And afterwards have a meal in the visitor centre."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Did the river cruise as a part of the Ghan journey from Darwin to Adelaide. Was surprised to find such a green place in the outbacks of Australia. The boat tour was in the late afternoon, so no animals to be except for a couple of birds. No crocodiles at all. The helmsman cum guide gave a nice running commentary during the whole tour, so worth listening to him. Enough opportunities and locales to click pictures. I would assume the chopper tour would be more awesome, viewing from a vantage point."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We very much enjoyed the display at the Visitors' Centre of this National Park. It was presented in a fresh, up-to-date style and explained very clearly the campaign by the indigenous population to recover the ownership of their land in his region. It was also good on the wildlife etc of the park. Worth a visit!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),A very nice National Park with great facilities for campers and day trippers. Bonus was the wonderful pool at the camp ground.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),This was amazing! Stunning ! A must do. From the walk down to the boat from the info centre to the gorge to the dinner all great! You have an informative cruise of the gorge you get to have a walk and wonder then you get to meet travelers shares experience over dinner.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Stayed in Darwin for a long weekend and decided to have a day trip to see Nitmiluk Gorge (also known as Katherine gorge). It was well worth the 8 hour round trip - it was simply stunning!! Myself and hubby went on the Nit nit dreaming 2 gorge trip - which takes you to the first 2 gorges. It was fantastic! Absolutely amazing to see!! The tour guide was fantastic - very informative! Such a stunning location.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Absolutely beautiful, the serenity of cruising up the Gorge and getting out for a short walk to the 2nd gorge was amazing, so close to nature. Our cruise director Jason was very informative and obviously knew a lot about the area, he was very friendly and threw in jokes here and there on our journey. The extended cruise allowed for us to swim in the 2nd Gorge which was welcomed. Many of the others on the cruise enjoyed jumping from the natural landscape into the deep gorge, just divine. Water and snacks were part of the package and a big emphasis was placed on hydration lots of free water available. All in all a great morning out."

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The Nitmilik National Park is such a delight. Breathtakingly beautiful with mammoth rock formations and views from Barawei Lookout. We took a two Gorge tour and that was great and you got to see things close up which you wouldn't, if you walked the top of the escarpment. I wished we had more time to explore but the heat was quite overwhelming even earlier in the day. The bats are not so nice and poop on you as you head down to the boat cruise. Great area where both the indigenous and non indigenous folk can be as one with nature in a beautiful setting. Our guide on the cruise was Jason and he was very knowledgeable."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Very well run tour of the gorge - we chose the 2 gorge tour. Guide was very informative stopping plenty of times along the river for photo opportunities. Around $80 for the 2 hour tour. @cwenzel_

You get a light back pack when you go on your tour that has a bottle of water, cookie, piece of fruit and cake. Handy to carry your other bits and pieces in!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We decided on a canoeing adventure in the Gorge. We opted for an early start half day canoe hire. We wanted to explore at our own pace. We wanted solitude. We wanted to be able to take time to enjoy what ""floats our boat"". Are we glad we did. After the initial queuing and waiting to get away, we find we get a bonus Gorge cruise to get past the Croc nasty part of the Gorge. Such a serene experience at 8:00am in the morning when everything is just ""waking up"". Once we were in our canoe and off on our own the true wonder of the Gorge emerged. We could drift silently at the base of the million year old cliffs, hear the water dripping from the cliffs, look under the overhangs. We had such a great time. There was no rush to get to the end of Gorge 3 and the portering was not too much of a challenge for us 50 year olds. We enjoyed a relaxed picnic brunch (self prepared) before making our way back in time to get the boat trip back. We had a great time, did not feel any stress about timing and took away some awesome photos and memories."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Nitmiluk National Park should be on every ones bucket list to Visit!! The walking trails, wildlife and magnificent views are all just breathtaking! We visited in July so the weather was hot, and dry, so take plenty of water with you if you are exploring the many walking tracks! The cafe was brilliant and the view of thousands of bats hanging in trees while we were sitting outside enjoying a bite to eat was Just spectacular!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"A beautiful way to experience some culture. Boat tours, swimming, kayak, fishing, helicopter flights, cafe they have it all. Great knowledge of history and culture a beautiful place in the Northern Territory a must see if visiting katherine"

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Stunningly beautiful location. The dinner cruise on the Katherine Gorge is a unique experience. Very special. We stayed at Cicada Lodge and it could not be faulted. Excellent quality and personal service. Highly recommend.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"From a Kakadu campervan experience, Katherine Gorge was most probably a highlight with good hikes and good facilities. However, the bats are a problem. Also, I am not a camper and hence do not get the camping experience of sitting in dust or crowded pools. If you have to do it, I guess I would recommend Nitmiluk because of the scenic hikes."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We stayed 4 nights here as our base and couldn’t have wished for a better experience. Make sure you do the 3 gorge cruise and the Dawn one is fantastic for the light. Splurge and take the helicopter flight and do the Ultimate 3-4 hours one if you can afford it and stop to have the Swim in your own waterhole and explore the rock art. The view from above is just fantastic. Also do a walk starting with the Baruwei Loop by climbing up to the lookout and taking the loop back across the escarpment. You’ll even get a surprise it you have your phone with you as this was one of the only places we ever got mobile reception. Anyway we loved it here with the stars and bats at night and dawn, crocks, eagles, buffalos and gorgeous gorges."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We have been here before and had to come again, did a couple of the walks up to the Southern Rockhole and Pats lookout as well as the Baruwei lookout and loop walk, around 5 or 6 km. The gorge and views from above are amazing and worth the walk. Lots to see and do in the park."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The gorge is superb, a cruise or canoe trip is a must. There are also some great walks, the easy 5km loop is great."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Did the Baruwei Lookout and loop walk in the morning and the 20minute helicopter flight in the afternoon. The lookout was good but don't worry with the loop walk if its hot and you have already seen lots of bush as there are no real views. Helicopter was worthwhile.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),The visitor centre is first class and the boat trip on Katherine Gorge is amazing and is a must for everyone Will do it again
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),I have travelled a fair bit in Australia and this is still one attraction I always come back to if I am in the area. I have now done this gorge cruise three times now. Stunning scenery and well worth the trip. The surrounding walks are stunning as well. The guide on the boat was also very informative and entertaining.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),A great day and way to view the gorges. Travelling along the river is an easy way to appreciate the size of the gorge. (The alternative being long walks.) The tour guide was informative and knowledgeable. At the third gorge we went to a swimming hole with a waterfall - the joy of swimming in fresh water is wonderful. The force of the waterfall needs to be experienced to be believed. The trip was finished off with the best coffee we had in the NT at the visitor informational centre.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Can't say enough positive things about this place. Overwhelmingly beautiful scenery as well as one of the best run national parks I've been to. Fabulous visitors' centre, helpful and knowledgeable staff, great campground, wonderful facilities, etc, etc. A MUST visit..."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Nitmiluk National Park is about a 30km drive from Katherine, on good roads. Once there there is an excellent Visitor's Centre with a great display about the area, as well as a cafe and gift shop. From there we did a short walk (about an hour return) to the top of lookout over the first gorge - a lot of steps but a fairly easy walk otherwise. The view was amazing and gave us a real taste of the area. The walk continues on to become a much longer loop, while we retraced our steps back to the carpark. We saw (and heard) lots of Flying Foxes in the trees around the river. When the crocodile risk is low, kayaking on the river would also be a great way to see the gorges. We chose not to do the boat cruise (quite expensive for a family of 5) although it does let you see much more of the gorge and is quite enjoyable (I did it myself many years ago). There are also helicopter rides available which give an incredible view of the national park"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We loved Southern Rock hole! The walk is challenging but so worth it. You can walk both ways or catch the ferry or do a walk/ferry combo! A very special place!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The most amazing, scenic park/walk I have ever experienced. Friendly Rangers, information centre staff and great place for a coffee before heading out."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Hands down this is the best national park in the country. From the cleanliness of the park. The walk ways a well maintained and signed. We were these over the Easter break and everything was open and ready and running. We enjoyed a boat tour and a range or walks to the various water holes. This place you have to visit.

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),This has been a massive highlight! 20 minute Helicopter flight over the 3 Gorges. Book and pay at Nitmiluk info Centre. Only $105. We flew with the windows out which made it so much better. Scenery is jaw dropping and our pilot Matthew was informative and funny. 10/10
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Drove to the park to see Katherine Gorge and stayed a bit. It is typical of the parks in NT - well laid out and really natural. As we walked around we saw trees fiull of fruit bats. There are salt water crocs here just now as the water was high enough in the ""wet"" for them to get in. The day we were there they caught a 5meter ""saltie"". Local crocks are much smaller."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"You'll be drawn to the majestic beauty and sheer size of the spectacular Katherine Gorge. Located on the lands of the Jawoyn people, rock art sites dot the park and dreaming stories bring the silent gorge walls to life. You can learn about the Jawoyn people's association with the land at the Nitmiluk Centre or by taking a boat cruise of the first few gorges. Take sunrise or sunset cruises and see the gorge turn all shades of mauve and red. There are canoes for hire or you can get a permit to use your own canoe from the Nitmiluk National Park Visitor Centre."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Enjoyed a 2 hour trip in 2 Gorges, im blown away just how amazing the gorge is, the guide taking us was very informative and even gave us a good laugh. I would recommend going on a cruise as it is really worth it. I will be back in the dry season for sure"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Went on a boat trip up the 2 gorges and went for a swim. It is absolutely stunning. It is no wonder this is a special place
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),we had the most amazing 3 nights camping here in the national Park and also enjoyed the two gorge cruise while we were here...a truely breathtaking experience that was a highlight of our adventure. The staff that run the National park were extremely helpful and accomodating to our additional needs and went out of their way to help us enjoy a magical few days here Thank you
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The Katherine Gorge boat trip is one of the NT highlights and should not be missed. If walking is not your strengths, select the two gorge trip (a short walk between gorge one and two). The scenery is spectacular and presents many opportunities for photographers.(watch out for the dark/light contrasts !). The boat trips are well organised and the comentry is very informative. In summer go in the morning or late afternoon."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Loved the cruise between the two gorges, but safety was an issue on the second gorge, as there was no handrails to pull yourself up from the boat to the land, this late in the dry season. There was no one to help people up from the boat either. It was a huge step up, probably better to have been a bum on the step first, then trying to step up and take a fall. Needs to be looked into before someone gets seriously hurt and there is trouble."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We spent 5 days travelling through this wonderful area! From the ancient rock paintings of Ubirr to the many waterfalls, swimming holes and the historical outback pub at Grove Hill and the spectacular Katerine Gorge! An amazing experience!"

The park has a great visitors centre, lots of hikes for all levels of fitness and experience plus lots and lots of wildlife which is great and will approach you. We did a cruise since we had the time to spare on our second jaunt into the area and we made sure to moon them when we saw them on the other day, because we are mature like that and some people cheered haha. Great National Park."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We stayed in this beautiful national Park in July for 3 nights in our own car. The national park is really stunning and I would defenetly recommend a boat tour to the third gorge. We also ate once on the campground in the pool area. Beautiful and cold pool. The chef was a German young guy. Very friendly and knowledge. The food was very good. We had a steak (perfect Medium rare) and a pizza. For the steak u had a warm and cold buffet. That was really good and yummy. We would 100% recommend The NITMILUK NATIONALPARK and a dinner at the pool.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We did a cruise through two of the gorges and the scenery was spectacular. The guide on the boat pointed out many features in the landscape and different flora and fauna which definitely added to the experience. Will definitely come back for a longer visit to this national park.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This is a HUGE national park with many walking trails to explore. Unless you are experienced Please take advice from the Parks Rangers before you set off. Amazing variety of landscapes, wildlife and scenery. Some wild like (spiders and snakes and crocs) can be dangerous, so be aware. Loads of water needed - as in camel back + a couple of litres extra. BRILLIANT place"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"There would be very few of us that have not heard the song with the title 'Sounds of Silence', The daylight part of the NITMILUK Dinner Cruise is spectacular in itself but when the sun disappears over the the gorges rim and your sitting round a impeccably set table with glass of champagne in your hand, looking at the sides of the gorge being reflected in the mirror surface of the water as the boat slowly drifts along, the is nothing but the sounds of silence. To see the transition from hot sun (though at 4.30 the bite has subsided somewhat and there is more shade than the earlier trips) through the sunset into absolute pitch black darkness is like transitioning two worlds. If you do nothing else when in Katherine, make the dinner cruise a must. The meal was superb, the waiting staff more than helpful and the experience memorable."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Wildlife abounds all around. A great place to walk around up to the top of the gorge and back. Cruises were a little expensive for my taste. The Visitors Centre holds a lot of great info and a nice coffee shop to relax in but make sure the birds don't steal your food.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We booked the 4 hr river cruise so we could experience more of the river and gorge. My teenagers wanted to swim and the 4 hr allowed included a swim in the gorge. We booked the last tour of the day and it was perfect.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"So many options here that will suit all ages, fitness levels. Lots of great walking trails and tour options. We did the morning 3 gorge cruise with swimming. Our guide was amazing, extremely knowledgeable on flora, fauna, culture, etc. Highly recommended tour."

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed the sunset dinner cruise. It was amazing to see the gorge up close. The food was delicious(I had the barramundi) and it was obviously cooked by an experienced chef who presented the food beautifully.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Great guides and very knowledgeable on the cruise (2 gorges tour) . Awesome scenery - I kind of ethereal beauty . I've been to the Grand Cannon which was incredible and this too has its own uniqueness just a long way to see it all .
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Spend a day here easily, scenery is amazing and wildlife is abundant. On a trip from Darwin to Uluru, this is up there with best national park."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We camped at Nitmiluk National Park for 2 nights in July 2016. The weather was absolutely beautiful and although we were well prepared for it, we had no issues with mosquitos or midgies. We camped in the camping grounds which are about a 40 minute drive from Katherine and were very surprised at the facilities available to us. There is a beautiful big pool, reasonably clean amenities and a BBQ/ Camp Kitchen. There are plenty of powered and unpowered sites but make sure you get in early if it is school holidays, otherwise you shouldn't have a problem getting a good site. I would definitely recommend the Nitmiluk Cruise and also the shortest walk. I can't remember the name of the walk but I wouldn't attempt any of the walks unless you have a large bottle of water. The shortest walk will take you around 2 hours and a good half of the walk is up steep, uneven ground, so be prepared."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Wonderful experience of geography, geology, history and culture. Scenic splendour shared with all by the indigenous landowners in a sensitive, caring way. Tour leader and skipper Chris does an exceptional job of enduring understanding of this wonderful site."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We had a great experience in Nitmiluk National Park during our visit in December (wet season). Enjoyed the 2 night stay inside the park at Nitmiluk Chalets - the best decision - with lots of greens and wildlife around (birds, wallabies). Loved the tasty, reasonable priced food in Sugarbag Cafe at the Visitor Center and pre-cooked meals delivered to the room. On top of all, we had the rare opportunity to cruise Katherine Gorge on a power boat with only a few other people. The river was flooded due to heavy rains and the cruise was initially cancelled but then they decided to take us on a power boat. It felt almost like a roller coaster on the raging river, a bit scary but definitely an adventure. We went as far as the third gorge and straight. Normally boats cruise the calm water down to the 2nd gorge with a short stone walk in between where water level is shallow. Highly recommend this awesome national park."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We arrived at the height of the school holidays and were surprised to see how busy it was but it was all run so smoothly. We had booked 4 hours of kayaking and it was a wonderful way to see the gorges. We then had a night in the camp ground which was very well appointed and toilet facilities were beautifully clean. Unexpectedly delicious dinner by the pool and good breakfast in the Visitors Centre before we headed into the wilderness for 6 days on the Jatbula Walk. It was amazing! What an all round great experience.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Great place to visit when you are touring through the territory.We loved a few of the local swimming holes,very refreshing on a hot dry season day"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Fantastic 2 hour cruise through the gorge - imposing rock formation. The tour is run by the traditional owners and our guide was very informative. The gorge is divided into several waterways and it was necessary to walk between the 2 that were accessible. There are paved walkways which made this walk comfortable. We only managed to see on crocodile on the day.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Nitmiluk NP is managed by the Jawoyn people, indigenous Australians who have lived on this land for thousands of years. It is home to the spectacular Katherine Gorge which is plenty enough of a draw card. There is a large camping ground with safari tents and two bdrm mobile homes (Nitmiluk chalet). Luxury accommodation can be found at Cicada Lodge. You can do hikes around the area and kayak in the gorge. Saltwater crocs are removed at the end of the wet season. The cruises throughout the gorge are fantastic. We did a 4hr one and it was a holiday highlight. This should be on everyone's bucket list."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Best way to see the 2 gorges. Easy access no wheel chair access but walking sticks, frames are a can do."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This was a pleasant way to spend the morning. The staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful. The sights were fantastic and cruising down the gorges were the best way to see it and to end it off you get to have a swim."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did the 2 hour cruise at 9am. The scenery was spectacular. This country of ours has so many hidden treasures. Nitmiluk being one of them. The guide was very knowledgeable and we caught a glimpse of a ""freshy"" sunbaking on a rock."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),I rated the cruise as excellent but there were some issues with the walks. Depending on which direction you started a walk (clockwise versus anti clockwise) the sign posting could be pretty ordinary. When you are walking 10+ kms in above 30 degree heat this can be an issue. Also a lot of the trail is very slippery with loose rocks and sand. We had appropriate footwear and still found ourselves having to be very careful to avoid falling. Having said this there is no disputing the sights are breath taking standing at the top of the gorge looking down and it is a different perspective from the vantage point on the boat. Would recommend
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),there are a lot of good walk trails if you enjoy that kind of thing . If swimming is your thing there are a few crock safe waterholes IN THE DRY SEASON ONLY . Plenty of plants to see as well.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did the Ultimate Helicopter tour which took us over all 13 gorges and along the river before landing at a rock art site further into remote Jawoyn country. A short ride back to a gorgeous rock pool where we had exclusive use of the pool while Tom, our awesome pilot went for a walk. Even though I was terrified, Tom made me feel very safe and I found the 3 hours absolutely exhilarating. Tom definitely deserves a pay rise and this tour is worth every cent!! We followed this with the fabulous sunset dinner cruise that night so we could see the gorge up close. Food was amazing and Chis the tour guide was clearly passionate about his country and his role as ambassador for this beautiful part of NT. So wonderful to see Nitmiluk tours being managed by traditional owners and doing such a fantastic job of sharing the beauty of Katherine Gorge."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Fantastic trip on boat up the gorges. Beautiful scenery, aboriginal rock art worth seeing. The information and knowledge imparted on us is interesting and worthwhile."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"When you have the opportunity to travel to NT take it with both hands and run. We were privileged to visit Nitmiluk and once again could not get over the beauty, the vastness, how clean everywhere we visited. So so wonderful"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The campground at Nitmiluk National Park is one not to be missed! Full facilities including showers/toilets, pool, bar/bistro, laundry ($4 in $1 coins required but the pool bar will change them for you). Powered and unpowered sites with 3 bars of Telstra reception. You can actually get your tent pegs into the ground too here! Powered sites are $47.50 per two adults. 5 minute walk to the Nitmiluk Tours Centre which has a little shop attached which even sells laundry powder! Have stayed here 4 times in the last three weeks on our top end trip and will definitely be back."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Stayed in camping ground very pleasant plenty of shade clean amenities and a great pool! Had dinner at poolside bistro..great!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Some really nice walks. Fresh water crocs. Nice views. Can go on tours. 3 gorge one includes swin and snacks. Ample parking. In wet season there are speed boat tours. In the dry flat boats to cope with numbers and some transfers and walking involved. 26km out of town. All bitumen to there.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Katherine gorge is amazing, Gunlom you have to see to believe, Yellow river is spectacular at sunrise, the sunrise breakfast cruise from Cooinda highly recommended!!, Ubirr is magical there is so much to see we will be going back for sure!!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We booked one of the cabins for couple of nights in the national park to base yourself for walks cruises and just being close to activities you can do in the gorge. It was lovely with wallabies at your door bird life all around. Facilities were great pool bistro etc
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),This is a must see location if you're in Australia. I hiked the Baruwei Loop Walk and took pictures from the lookout point. Very beautiful and it was free. Saw some great wildlife including hundreds of bats hanging in a the trees. There are more walking trails with various distances and difficulties. Great visit for the entire family!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The vast array of options available for all age groups and fitness levels is great. Wild Life, walks, boat trips, it just goes on."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We took the boat trip, which was very enjoyable. The guide was superb and gave us lots of information. The cave drawings were not that clear. The scenery was wonderful."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"No section to review cruises so I've put it here. Had an opportunity to going along on the Sunset Dinner Cruise Saturday night and what a great night it turned out to be. Went with a great group of friends. Food on the menu was awesome. Crocodile bisque...mmmmm.....ginger tea and lemongrass sorbet, steak and more. Don't miss doing this cruise. Sunset was gorgeous. Will do again."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Went for the 2 k walk up to the escarpment for the view of the 1st gorge. Beautiful. Was a bit hard going up the steps and was longer than I thought it would be. Take water bottle full and fill it up at the top from the fountain available. Follow the yellow arrows. If it's hot take it slowly. Well worth the effort.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),It was lovely to be able to chat with a local elder who was painting and also to wander through the display and learn about the gorge and its ancient and modern histories.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I was travelling on the Ghan from Alice Springs to Darwin and was contemplating whether or not to do a tour to Katherine Gorge during our stop to Katherine. I was so glad I did after i experienced the gorge. This was an organised tour run by the ghan for a two hour cruise along Katherine Gorge. We experienced two gorges and after the first gorge we had to get off the boat, walk across the other side to board another boat. This allowed us to see more and learn about the local history. Our guide was great! He explained about bush tucker and how to use the plants near the gorge for bush medicine. We also came across two small crocodiles and saw the change in colour of the sandstone's due to the sun positions. Make sure you bring a hat, sunglasses and especially sunscreen! The sun will roast you!! Once you get off the coach you will come across many (and i mean PLENTY) of fruit bats hanging off most trees in the national park and they also give you cold drinks and fruit salad prior to the cruise. Overall it was beautiful and a highlight of my trip to the outback. Don't miss it!!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"There are some good walks in the national park if you are a keen walker or hiker. Some of them looked diffifult but the one to the lookout is not so bad, a steep climb and a bit hot at the top. Great views of the gorge."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),I did the walk to Baruwei lookout and took the ferry to the Southern Rockhole. Loved the rockhole! Amazing place to have a swim. Just as good as the swimming places at Litchfield NP but without all the people. A must do!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We have spent a couple of days here with lots of bush walking and taking in the spectacular sights the park has to offer. Some trails are suitable for children and people who have difficulties walking on rough terrain and other trails are great for more adventurous bush walkers/hikers.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"There is something for everyone in this park. Waterfalls, swimming holes, walks. treks, cruises, heli tours...the list goes on. You could never be bored with the most stunning scenery you will see anywhere."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We did the tour with a company called Nitmulik tours and our guide made our day very special. There was no glossy rubbish like some tour guides. He was very knowledgable and friendly. The whole day was great.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"As a local I have visited this amazing park over and over in the last 20 years. Whether you like cruising the river, walking to the beautiful water holes, helicopter sightseeing, fine dining cruising- Nitmiluk National Park has it all. Varied activities on offer and different seasons. It's a must for the bucket list🌷"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The water's perfect, vegetation lush and green and the air is so fresh to breathe. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about Nitmiluk, it's always a pleasure visiting. The Katherine Gorge is fantastic and is extremely interesting to know how long it has taken to form. Would recommend the boat tour."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We spent New Years Eve in one of the Chalets. It was a beautifully quiet place, with the obligatory fireworks at about 9.00pm. Perfect!!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We have visited at the end of the dry season - temperatures were at the 40s, the streams wete very dry. The only place to escape was the swimming pool at the camp site. The kayak hire was very expensive and fully booked by tour groups. The very long walks were not worth the effort. Overall disappointment and we decided to leave earlier than planned."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Funnily enough I was only here for about an hour for a quick business meeting on site. But with the opportunity there even though we had limited personal time, we decided to do the fastest walk to a view point we could, the Barrawei track. You can start this from the car park beside the ramp where boat tours leave from. It's over a kilometre walking up the ridge (some places are very steep, and some steps are the sandstone rocks, no way anyone with mobility issues could do this). At the top you can continue on more trails, unfortunately all we had time for was a few photos. But now have ticked off a great Australian icon"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We got up early and paddled down the Nitmiluk Gorge. Wow, so peaceful and stunning! We packed a lunch and made sandwiches in the third Gorge, very romantic. Second gorge was the highlight for us, just stunning. Take the time to do it yourself. Highly recommended."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Such a wonderful place to visit. We did a dawn cruise and it was great not too hot. Very knowledgeable guides and fun too. They supply plenty of water and if you are not up to walking the short distance between gorges, on very well maintained paths, you can sit in the boat until group comes back. Beautiful ancient place full of wonderful aboriginal culture,everyone should put it on their bucket list."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),What a great place and the visitor centre is so well run. With the cultural influence shinning through every department . Well informed guides and great walks for all abilities it's an essential stop on your tour of the top end! And only a 3 hour drive from Darwin! Loved it! Will highly recommend!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"we took a helicopter flight after the amazing scenic boat trip up to the second gorge, the chopper took us up to see all 13 gorges & landed to give a wonderful view at the top of the 7th gorge. The chopper only takes 2 passengers & the pilot gives a very informative commentary. every Australian who like to explore this country need to tick this box"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Loved the park. The photos really don't do it justice. A must to go see for the whole family. Would definately recommend.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"An amazing National Park, the Katherine Gorge is amazing (a bit .. too relaxed maybe, but great after several days tour). Also Edith Falls are amazing, and end up your day in Katherine Hot Springs."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We went on a 3Gorge boat tour, well what a treat! The unspoilt beauty of the Gorge was simply magnificent. The Tour Guide had eagle eyes, untold knowledge of the area and a great sense of humour. We even got to take a swim in the Gorge, not a bad swimming hole I must say. After the cruise we took a Helicopter flight over Nitmiluk. Fantastic to do after cruising on it. The visitor centre was also interesting reading about the geology, history and inhabitants of the area. Take plenty to drink though, was quite warm on the cruise."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Definitely worth a look if you have a day to spare in Katherine. The gorge tour of swim, walk, boat, canoe is well worth it"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We took a half hour helicopter flight which was magnificent. The park is only accessible by a 63 kilometre walking track which we were not up to. We explored all the falls by air and our pilot pointed out lots of interesting places and facts as well. This was a great way to see all of the inaccessible areas that cannot be seen any other way. Staff are nice and friendly.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"What an amazing experience to see all 13 gorges from the air, a totally different experience from the ground view. Well worth every cent we paid for the flight (about 45 mins) and wish we could have done the two hour flight with the adventure swim. The views of the gorges are just amazing, and the lookout at Nitmiluk Gorge is awesome. If you can afford the dollars, definitely do this one. It was our once in a lifetime experience, and we loved it. The pilot gives a commentary along the way, and you are able to speak with him and ask questions also. Saw freshwater crocs, buffalo and even hikers doing the five day walk to Edith Falls about 65 kms away."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Very good area viewing .be prepared for walking some flat areas but not easy. Had 4wd which helped get around
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We took the two gorge tour. This is a two hour cruise was boasted by a local guide who was a wealth of information. His knowledge of the water flow through the gorges over time, the rock formation and how one affected the other; the local crocs and their nesting habits, etc. really opened our eyes to the amazing beauty of this area and its history. Well worth it."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This was really good too Was great photography around here too nice scenery Recommended good tour , part of the whole tour we stopped at this"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"It is a beautiful park! The gorge is impressive, and there's plenty of wildlife! The walks are well-signposted and the information boards give accurate information regarding difficulty and time required to complete the walks. Bring plenty of water. Spend a few hours Katherine River, whether on a cruise, in a kayak, or swimming."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"What a great Park. Did the canoe down the gorge, fantastic and would have loved to do more walks. Went to Edith falls, beautiful. Would love to spend heaps more time exploring this Park."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"A range of activities carered for. Hiking, canoeing, boat tours, helicopter & fixed wing flights. Campground on site."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Loved the carefree wandering and views. Not long there but enjoyable. A must see if you have the time
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),I chose this tour after reading reviews on TA. Nitmiluk 3 Gorge tour was fabulous. Chris was our guide/ boat driver for the day and he's a lovely bloke. Unassuming and so full of information about his home. In the wet the gorge has enough water running thru it to fill the Sydney Harbour 8 times over! It's wonderful to see the original owners and National Parks coming together to preserve such an awesome part of Australia. Must see if your near Katherine.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Travellers should be made aware that Nitmiluk is the new name for Katherine Gorge National Park, we have seen the new name on fridge magnets in souvenir shops and I think that most travellers would not be aware of this."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Our group ( my wife and I and another couple) visited Nitmiluk National Park during our stopover in Katherine. The park is easily accessible by a good sealed road and is a ""Must Do"" for anyone travelling up the Stuart Highway. There is ample parking available at the Visitor Centre where visitors can avail themselves of meals and souvenirs, take a walk through the diorama depicting the history and geography of Nitmiluk and the Gorges and book tours. For younger and fitter folk they are able to hire canoes to explore the gorges or they can discover the park via the many walking tracks. We did it the easy way, opting to view the gorges while taking a cruise."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This 292,800 hectare National Park is owned by the Jawoyn Aboriginal people and jointly managed with the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory. This park is massive and you can do so many things such as walks, boat rides, canoeing, helicopter and fixed wing flights,fishing and swimming or just looking at rock art. Most people just see the magnificent Katherine Gorge but there is so much more to this park"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Wow this really was spectacular. Almost 4 hours cruise in total visiting the first and second gorges and then boarding the dinner boat which stayed in the first gorge for sunset and dinner. The food was lovely - all courses and the surrounds unsurpassed . This was an expensive thing to do but really worth it. Staff were excellent and guide very knowledgable . Even our two children aged 11 and 14 loved this.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Enjoyed an overnight visit to the Nitmiluk National Park. The facilities/accommodation are great; the willingness/capacity of staff to help very limited. Example 1: Checking into accommodation, the chalets at the park - this was first time in my life have I been told that I couldn't check in (20 minutes after 2pm check in time) for another 10 minutes 'because the paperwork was not ready'. Service definitely got off to a mediocre start. Example 2: When enquiring about hikes, we were there were no maps available as all walks were 'well signposted'. On pressing the staff member, we were finally given a map which covered only the first/shortest loop - to Baruwei Lookout + Loop walk. A dotted line on our printed map denoted as 'start Southern Walks'. Based on a signpost that denoted distance, we decided to extend our loop walk to go to Pat's lookout. Although light was fading, we reasoned we had enough time as we knew the distance. Upon arrival at Pat's Lookout, whilst we considered walking to Jedda's rock, we decided against it as the distance was NOT signposted. As it seems, all walks were not well signposted - we would have thought having a park map available of all the walks for visitors a basic safety requirement. Example 3: We had planned on canoeing the gorge for a full day, but when booking on arrival (for the following day) we were told we could only do a half day as full day hires were 'full' - this meant we were limited to canoe the first gorge only. We were told that full day numbers were limited to 10 groups (as opposed to 35 groups for half day), with no explanation as to why. It became evident whilst canoeing the following day - that canoes were 'parked' in the second gorge for those were privileged to be in the 10 who got in first 'full day' canoe hire. Some explanation would have been helpful. Staff were pleasant, but appeared ill-equipped with knowledge of the park, and some with a 'take it or leave it' attitude. A shame really, as this is a truly spectacular part of the world."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),A tightly planned itinerary unfortunately only gave us half a day in this spectacular National Park... it wasn't enough. The glimpses that I had of the scenery were enough to convince me that I will have to return some day soon. The Gorge area is beautiful!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),The walks were amazing but you will need good walking shoes. Make sure you have packed swim wear as there are good places to swim
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Nitmiluk is a great place to experience the Northern Territory outdoors at its best. We usually go to the Gorge area for birdwatching (Great Bower Birds and Crimson Bee Eaters last week in addition to the numerous honey eaters, Red Tailed Black Cockatoos, Corellas etc) and a walk up hte escarpment to the viewing platforms. The rest of the family headed out for canoeing and camping which was terrific as well. Lots to do at the cafe too - resident blue wing Kookaburra this time - with a special Jawon art and craft workshop. Its the place to be!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"A trip up or down the Stuart Highway isn't complete without a visit to the Gorge. There is a caravan/ camping area within walking distance of the Gorge, it is a lovely clean park with pool etc. There is a visitor information centre with very helpful staff. The Gorge tours are owned and operated by the local Jaywon people, the guides are experienced and passionate. The two gorge cruise tour is a MUST see as a minimum. You will see much natural beauty, hear stories of the dreamtime, the traditional beliefs of how yhe 13 gorges were formed etc. there are also many walking tracks and lookouts. It is free to enter the park itself however if overnughting or taking tours there is a fee... Quite reasonably priced. There are also helicopter flights on offer, they range in cost from $100 for 10 mins or much more for personal charters. Definately well worth a visit. Also in Katherine is a hot spring and a low level crossing where swimming can be safely enjoyed... Both of these places are sign posted on the Victoria highway at the north end of town."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Good campground with a pool and clean amenities. The National Park is impressive with good information about walks and tours available. We took the sunrise gorge tour and were not disappointed - the early morning light provides good contrast for photographs.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Visited Nitmiluk National Park in April this year & have done many times previously. This raw beauty of this place never ceases to amaze me. The visitor centre is well set up, with a learning centre with many displays, including a scale model of the gorge which help put the size of the area in to context for my 3 primary school age children."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We stayed two nights ta the campgrounds in outr own camper trailer we parked just below the pool area. It was a great base to do our helicopeter flight and our river cruise. We ate out at the bistro one night and the BBQ Ribs were delicious, we used the pool both days, it was absolutely gorgeous to come back to after a walk. I did the walk up to the lookout and down along the creek back to the campground with my 7 year old in about 3 hours. I would recommend the helicopter flight and the river cruise and the walk, to see the beautiful gorge from all aspects. This NP is so well run and is a credit to NT Parks and Wildlife. The only thing we would say is DO NOT FEED THE BIRDS as this hass led them to becoming quite tame and cheeky enough to raid our garbage spreading it everywhere, as well as raiding our box of fruit and veg we had under our camper. So lock up your foods and put your rubbish in the bin so they have nothing to get at."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We recently have a 4 hour stop over whilst travelling on the Ghan to Darwin and our package included a trip to the park and a boat cruise through 2 of the Gorges. We would definately recommend this experience. Our guide was excellent, informative and went to every effort to make sure we were safe and had the best photo opps (both sides of the boat, including whenever we spotted a freshwater crocodile (5 of them) she would make sure we got as close as possible and that both sides of the boat had good photo opps). There is a short walk (concrete paved with steps) between both gorges but although described as intermediate is really quite easy. We were provided with fresh fruit salad and a drink as we boarded and the only criticism would be the wait to board (approx 200 odd train passengers milling about the dock for up to 20 mins before any loading started - we thought this could have been better organised and loading started earlier)."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Absolutely loved the cultural experience as an off train excursion for the ghan. The team members that gave us a talk about basket weaving, spears, painting, and tradional ways were passionate and loved what they were doing. The visitor centre was nice. Wish I was able to spend longer there!!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The boat cruise took us through the first 3 gorges (actually, 3 sections of the river separated by rapids). The scenery was attractive and the guide was knowledgeable, but the boat trip was a bit over-priced."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Wildlife, birds and kangaroos abound. The swimming pool in great as the weather is hot. Visitor Centre is very good."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Was our intro to the alligator in the wild and to be cruising down the gorges with the majesty of the red ,green and blue surrounding us was captivating.the sunset dinner cruise a must ...worth the expense as that special occasion on the trip and also the 3 gorge trip ...would think about doing the helicopter ride instead of the gorge the second time though ....a mistake maybe .....staying at Nitmiluk chalets or in the park was a great idea as well....bats ,kangaroos,bird life evident ...May is the month of the burn off so by the afternoon on the trip there is haze which bodes well for a red sunset which is great to see after a strenuous walk to the lookout above the gorge...having dinner around the pool is relaxing in the evening....staff cheery and relaxed particularly the guys and gals on the cruises"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did the 2 gorge cruise and were absolutely amazed by the beauty of this landscape. The commentary was very interesting and gave a wonderful insight into the vegetation, landscape and significance to the local indigenous people. The gorge itself is visually spectacular and a must see destination while in the area."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I never tire of visiting Katherine Gorge and the opportunity to take in the beauty of this magnificent place. We have been on the Gorge Tours many times and never cease to be amazed at the natural beauty. The Visitor Centre is informative, well maintained and well presented. The walk along the top of the gorge is well worth the effort if you are agile and fit but read all the guidelines before starting."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We were looking for somewhere to stay overnight in our campervan and found the Edith Falls section of the Nitmiluk National Park, about 40 klms north of Katherine. Acces was via a sealed road. The amenities blocks were well equipped and clean. The campsites were spacious and shady, with plenty of room between campers. There were large picnic tables scattered throughout. This place had the stillness we enjoy, as well as the facilities we needed. The evening was softened by the beautiful sound of the falls as the water found its way down into the Edith River. The next morning we enjoyed a short walk to see the falls and the swimming area. It was very well maintained and a sight to see in the early dawn of morning. Thank you for such a lovely experience. We would be certain to come this way again."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The hikes were amazing, though a bit challenging in the heat. The gorge tour was very informative and the swimming holes were divine."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),As part of our trip on The Ghan we chose to visit the Nitmiluk double gorge tour. Lucky for us the river was high so we didn't have to walk too far between the gorges (the temp was 36C & humid) Interesting sandstone rock formations and and history surrounding the evolution and the uses that Aboriginal groups use the fauna and flora to treat ailments. Huge stable boats are used so you feel very safe. Just a shame we didn't see any freshwater crocs!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I did the Southern walks in Katherine Gorge while my wife was busy. Its a fairly easy walk, but it can get very hot, so do carry lots of water, although they do have tanks of water along the route so you can fill up your bottles. There were not many flies at the end of February which made the walk quite pleasant and with a lot of water in the streams it was nice to be able to cool down. The water fall at the Southern Rockhole is stunning, and there is a nice sheltered clear pool for swimming. From there its just a short walk to Katherine River. Well worth the walk."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),If you've planned a trip to Kakadu then it's definitely worth the extra time to go to Nitmiluk. We had a great time on the 2 gorge cruise on Boxing Day. Nice commentary by the captain. Flies were a bit of a problem when the boat slowed down and when walking around the park but we still enjoyed our time there. We were there during the wet and we did see a croc hanging out by the boat launch area.. We saw a few wallabies in the park and on the cruise. We loved that!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"It may have been due to the time of year (December) but the flies in the park are maddening at times. Bring a t-shirt, or a dishrag, something to constantly flick on the sides of your face to keep the flies at bay. Other than this, the park is amazing. The walking trails are well marked and easily recognizable, and there are a few water spots along the way (but do bring a few liters of your own per person!) Not much wildlife to be seen on our trip but the landscape and plant life are constantly changing and always engaging. Exhausting but well worth it!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This is a must do if you've travelled this far to get to the Territory. There a few camping grounds to choose from, so you will have to choose where you want to stay. Do come equipped, and there are good cruises to do from here, helicopter flights, and canoeing and swimming if you're game. Locals do NOT swim at nitmuluk because it's well known that crocodiles (estuarine) live here and eat here. So even if it looks safe don't swim, because local indigenous leaders don't allow their kids too, so why would you? Great in Dry season. A must do. Loads of walks, wildlife to see, and locals to hang out with. A must do!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"What a way to see the Gorge or, rather, all 13 of them! Memorable experiences from the moment you meet the pilot to the moment you touch down again after seeing the enormity of the national park and getting the running commentary. This was my fourth visit to the Gorge, each many years apart, but the first time I've taken the flight. What a different perspective I have now and la piece de resistance was definitely the upgrade which gave us a landing on top of the eighth gorge to take photos. Wow! Our morning was enhanced then by the two hour cruise into those vast ancient walls. The price is upmarket, yes, but the experience is exceptional. Do yourself a favour - don't leave without getting a bird's eye view of a national treasure. You won't regret it!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I loved the cruise, Katherine Gorge is a beautiful part of the world. A must do in the NT. The Nitmiluk centre is a bit average I assume it's because they have the monopoly and the gorge sells itself. We showed up planning on going on a 4pm cruise but it had been cancelled so we went on the 7am the next day. It was a blessing in disguise we saw the sunrise over Katherine, it was a great temp for the cruise. The tour guide was great. A must see attraction"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),The dinner cruise was really delicious and a fun evening on a boat in the Katherine Gorge. The evening begins with a cruise on the first gorge with a short hike with rock art to the next gorge. Our journey was only to two gorges due to water levels but it was scenic. You will be seated with other guests unless you are able to fill a table of 6. Good service and a fun way to enjoy an evening. Great star viewing.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Loved the wild life and bird life. A lovely tranquil place. Dawn and dusk were special here. Glad to have seen it.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),An absolute must! Take your bathers and go for a beautiful swim! Enjoy the fresh water! Take your camera and capture the beauty of such a place! Do not leave unless you have seen this beautiful place!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Camped at the national park and took the 9am 2 hour cruise through 2 gorges. Having recently visited many gorges in WA, I was amazed to find that this one blitzed them all for beauty and spectacular scenery. We had to keep on clicking our cameras so as not to miss anything. After first gorge we walked over rocks to the boat waiting in the second gorge and admired the rock art along the way. Very relaxing and beautiful place to visit - not to be missed!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"It is a beautiful place to hike even if it's over 35 degrees Celsius, every sweat is worth the view. Priceless! The tracks are well signed and easy to see. Be prepared though for the heat during dry season can be harsh."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"As we were taking the Dawn Cruise on the gorge (which was awesome - 5 stars!!!) we chose to stay at the campground. The facilities were OK, probably what we expected for a campground. The pool was lovely and a welcome relief from the heat. It also had lots of tables and chairs around it which were convenient, especially if taking advantage of the grill for an evening meal (which we didn't). Considering the campsite was not grassy at all, just a patch of dust, we thought $47 a night (unpowered) for 2 adult and 2 kids was pretty steep."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We stayed one night and one day at the Nitmiluk National Park, or formerly known as Katherine George. The camp ground was ok, the pool small but ok. I would not swim in the Gorge, since they have many Saltwater crocodile traps set up. We went on the 2h cruise and this was very interesting."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Took a t rip to the Katherine gorge to spend time with people explaining basket weaving, rock art, bark painting, weapons including manufacture and use, walked around garden to identify trees used to make woomeras, spears etc. run by an indigenous family who brought it to life. Recommended"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"What you see and what you get are two different things......to book online and by just viewing the advertised material can lead to a big disappointment.....the caravan sites are the worst I have ever seen,dusty roads in the camp area,when you go out for a day trip,your camp site is taken by someone else.....especially if you are camping in a Motorhome and this is your only transport. Ablution blocks are well maintained as well as the swimmingpool area. The Visitor Centre and restaurant on the premises are outstanding.The cruises on the river is interesting but the visit to the Cutta-Cutta Caves was a disappointment...."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We liked the park and the staff they were very helpful when we asked a question. If you like hiking its a great place to do it also the cruise up the river was stunning very beautiful,"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),For those that are physically fit there were many choices for walks plus the advantage of many different species of wildlife including many bats in the trees by the information centre and bird life extraordinary many birds come into info centre which is lovely whilst having a meal or coffee
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Such a beautiful NP. Was so excited to visit and find out about indigenous cultural heritage only to find exhorbitant prices excluded our family of four. Even the canoe hire was going to be $150 for the four of us to spend the afternoon exploring together. Dragging my five year old up a walk was just not an option. Very disappointed!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The Northern Territoy is an amazing place to experience and the Nitmilik NP just adds to the adventure. Everywhere you turn you can see the uniqueness of this area. The Gorge is breathtaking. Start at the Visitors Centre and from there just explore. Always have sun protection, plenty of drinking water and insect repellant. Take a good camera to record this amazing area."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"a great big park, lots of walks, definitely recommend edith falls top pool, then head to Katherine for the night, a bit far for a day trip from Darwin so you need to stay overnight"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We spent one full day at Nitmiluk National Park. There probably would never be enough days to try and do everything that there is to do in the park, but if you are restricted then try and squeeze in as much as possible. The morning started off early with a kayak hire for half the day and exploring the 1st gorge. We walked over to the 2nd before returning our kayak by 12pm. We returned later in the afternoon for the Nabilil Dreaming Sunset Dinner Cruise. This is a must do. The meal was fantastic and we met 2 lovely couples travelling around Australia. The sunset on the gorges are magnificent and the 4 hours are well worth it."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I can't wait to have more visitors so I can go again. This is a truly stunning place. Make sure you wear something cool, take a hat , a bottle of water and some sunscreen."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"One of the most attractive places in the Northern Territory, stunning scenery with wildlife. There are 13 gorges, we took the cruise that covered the first and second gorges. In the tourist centre at the park, there is a shop and also a restaurant, ideal place stay away from the heat before the cruise. Take plenty of water and also wear some flat shoes because you have to walk to board another boat to see the second gorge. Good value for money, a must see attraction."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"A real outback experience. Amazingly beautiful place. Around every corner new stunning view emerge. I would recommend taking the 3,5-4 hours cruise. You get more time to explore the beautiful gorges and you get to swim in the gorge as well."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"A stunning national park, loved this place. We had a ranger take us through here and loved the whole bush feel that bumped off it. Definitely worth a peep"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We had a quick swim at Edith Falls on the way to Katherine. It was refreshing and lovely. We would have liked to have more time to do the walks. Perhaps next time.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"There is a range of things to do here, so don't assume its a case of getting in the gorge then getting out again, and in fact getting to the quieter parts of the park can be more rewarding."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Don't know we're to start, sensational and serene location which is well worth the visit. Depending on he much time you have can either canoe or take the boat tour. Have pans to head back o conquer more of the gorge levels in 2014 as well as the Jutbula trail 4 day walk"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I was here a few years ago, did the lot, canoes/helicopters/walk/breakfast cruise. Was amazing! Recently went back, and there is now a high end resort right on the gorge (Cicada Lodge) which is owned by the local Jawoyn people. If you need pampering and a brilliant chef, this is the perfect place for time out."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I guess the highlight of our two day stay in the Nitmiluk/Katherine Gorge National park was the boat trip up the gorges. A well informed laconic Aussie tour guide kept us amused and informed as we made our way through two of the iconic gorges. As the water levels were so low, we had to change boats and have a short walk along a well-formed rocky path, with the opportunity to see some traditional rock art as well. The tour was absolutely worth it. If you have the time and energy, the canoe hire would also be a great option. The only negative experience we had was booking our powered campervan site and the boat tour. The reception staff were brusque to the point of being rude, and later, when I wanted information, the receptionist looked extremely annoyed that I had distracted her from her online fashion e-shopping. also the powered campervan sites were probably the worst we'd encountered in the NT. Very little shade, and cramped together on hot gravel... not great. The cheaper unpowered sites were better value being more shady , and on grass. The pool and facilities were good however. Worth seeing despite my whinge."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Highlight of our 2 day visit was the Sunset dinner cruise on Katherine River - 2 gorges (only due to water level) , spectacular orange & pink colours to the gorge, viewing historic Aboriginal art, rare micro bats in small caves, several sightings of fresh water crocs, bird life, honoured to have traditional Aboriginal guide share his knowledge of the area, wonderful 5 course dinner, champagne (drinks extra) and our BBQ barramundi cooked perfectly. Felt like we had the whole gorge to ourselves and with the back drop of a spectacular gorge sunset. At this time of year you can hire the canoe on hourly rate and found 1 hour (if fit) was enough time to travel to end of first gorge and back. Surprising it was reasonable cool to be on the water with some wind despite 40 degrees. Enjoyed a swim in the river following canoe. In october - I would recommend doing some of the walks in the Nitmiluk NP but start before dawn (5:45am) and you will be rewarded with photographic opportunities at sunrise and feel more comfortable. Flies bit of problem but keep walking."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did the 9am Nitnit 2 Gorges cruise which includes an explanation of the surrounds, a short walk from the first to the second gorge. The water levels are very low but the trip has been well worth it. We booked online, were issued a ticket at the venue. There is a short walk to the boat and a short walk between the gorges."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The location is outstanding, great walking and even the boat trip was good if costly. The Nitmiluk camp site is a bit tired and limited, with no proper grey water disposal, nice pool though and incredible bird life. We made a quick exit after two days when the site was invaded by hordes of school children, we counted twelve minibuses and there may have been more which put the communal facilities under extreme pressure. You need to provision in Katherine which is 30something kms away. Water at A$6 for 500ml seems excessive!!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),It was great that we had a lovely guy at our hostel from Canada Zac who very kindly drove the four of us ladies to Nitmiluk so we could enjoy a morning canoeing the gorge
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Powered site in NP. lovely site with a great Pool, just a short walk away from the gorge and canoe hire. Took along time to find a pitch as not numbered and people had taken more room than they should, but kind campers lent us an extension cable so we could get power. Lovely natural setting with good amenities. Wallabies a plenty. Canoeing was brilliant but it is quite hard work but worth it to get to second gorge for swimming. Beautiful setting well worth a visit."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Simply amazing so beautiful and hardly anyone there. Falls relatively small but simply beautiful. Just a short distance from Katherine. Not to be overlooked
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We decided to walk as the boats were already fully booked and the canoes seemed very pricey... and did not regret it! We did the 8.4km Windolf walk (not difficult) and enjoyed magnificent views from the top of the gorge cliffs. Then we made our way down to Southern Rockhole (nothing much in the dry), but continued along past the rockhole and ended up on the river banks. There we enjoyed a lovely cool swim and the kids took delight in waving to the tourist boats as they went past. After our return to the information centre we ordered the most delicious barramundi burgers and fish and chips - the best we had in the Territory! Sitting on the huge balcony made our lunch even more enjoyable."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I stayed at the tourist park the first night in one of their tents. Fantastic value with a free meal, drink and breakfast. All were excellent and had a beautiful dinner around the pool (Rump steak and all the veg and salad you can eat). Showers and toilets were very clean. Tent was immaculate. The walk into the Gorge was superb. Not many people on it, even on a long weekend. River water you can drink. Awesome!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We have done the cruise 2 years ago and yes, it was great but today we have done a full day canoe hire and paddled up to the end of the 3rd gorge for $92 for 2 people which we thought was good value. You only paddle 12.5 kms so you are not rushed at all. It is so serene and beautiful with a few great places to stop for a snack. The gorges are ever- changing and the light and colours gorgeous. In the 2nd gorge we saw 2 ""freshies"" about 1m long as you can paddle so close to the shore. It is a bit tricky portaging the canoe but worth it. The rocks are so interesting and varied. You have tons of time to explore the 3 gorges on this day. If you do half day you only can do the first gorge which would be a bit disappointing. We also did the Butterfly Gorge and Lily Ponds walk. Great but hot and long, take tons of water. The staff at the Boat Ramp are relaxed but efficient."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"If you visit Katherine, do not miss a boat / walking tour of Katherine gorge, whilst it is expensive for a two gorge tour, it is one not to be missed,the gorge is one of the most spectacular in Australia. Other options are to either to the rim top walk of for the energetic, hire a canoe & take a leisurely paddle through the gorges.A MUST SEE."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"You start with a boat ride along a canal, then walk to another similar boat for the second gorge. If you are unable to walk (400m) there is a sitting place for you. Wen you return, there is a dinner boat waiting for you, and if your lucky enough to be sitting with nice people, it is a lovey evening. The full moon was beautiful and the food was decent- kangaroo meat was a little tough. The views are fantastic, and if you are in NT it is worth seeing this park. (We saw fresh water crocs!) Toilets on the boat are typical boat toilets, so be prepared!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Bloody fantastic. We did gorge cruise in aug 2013 our guide was superb a wealth of knowledge . Recommend a gorge cruise to all no matter what time of day, amazing , very picturesque. A must see point of call. Colleen S"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We took the climb up to the first lookout and then walked the trail back to the main road. We are now too old for real tracking or canoeing, but I am glad I made the effort to climb to the lookout, although there were a couple of times that I thought "" I must be crazy"". But in the end well worth it. Take a walking stick!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Fantastic evening and stunning scenery! Great food and excellent service. Absolutely recommend. Plenty of wild life to see including birds and crocs - don't worry as they are 'only freshies' and very informative and friendly guides.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),I always recommend people visit the gorge when they are up this way. We had a bit of a canoe ride in the morning then sunset dinner tour in the evening - just divine. I did some of the walks many years ago which are great but I much prefer the boat ride type now.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),An very relaxing and scenic cruise down the Katherine River. Awesome views coupled with an informative and fascinating commentary made this experience unforgettable. The bush tucker and a glass of bubbles were delish!
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),It's pretty much all about the gorges. We didn't spend a lot of time in the park itself. Only about 30 minutes for Katherine.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We only had two days in Katherine so we decided to do a cruise rather than hitting the walking trails. We chose a three gorge cruise which set us back bout $95 per head. Now some would think that sounds expensive however personal I'd rather pay that than hike for hours on end. We enjoyed the tour which made better by an aboriginal guide with a great sense of humour! Thanks heaps would gladly go again
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Both the gorge and Edith Falls are worthy of a visit. The attention to detail for visitors is excellent.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did the two hour boat cruise which was relaxing and spectacular.The highlight for me was the walking path when you swap boats from one Gorge to another.As you return to the jetty,look out to your left hand side and see fresh water crocodile rock formation,with lookout on his nose."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The best waterhole ever... When you walk in the park, they gave you time that are based on a fit man walk. The people at visitor center could be more efficient they just there to sell food or give the paper with the information on it not a great use of manpower..."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Nitimuluk is a deceptively large park which encompasses both Katherine Gorge and Edith Falls, which are many kilometres from each other. Of the two main attractions the gorge is the main attraction, but Edith Falls is a great place to enjoy a cool swim, which, because of crocodiles, is often not possible near the gorge."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We arrived at the visitor centre late in the afternoon and had no problems checking in. We parked our Motorhome close to the pool area. Inside the pool are is a fantastic bar and grill where you choose your steak, fish or chicken to be cooked. Fabulous choice of vegetables and salads in a buffet style. Whilst eating our amazing dinner we couldn't help but notice the large number of bats taking off into the night from the surrounding trees. Unfortunately when they return early in the morning (around 4am) the noise is quite disturbing. Our second morning wasn't as bad as we knew what to expect. The amenities block was quite spacious with numerous clean toilets and showers, excellent hot water and the use of the washing machines in the laundry are free. We did the 3 Gorge tour at 9am. This was a fantastic way to see the Gorge. Our guide, Richard, was very informative without being boring, and enjoyed a good laugh. He had excellent local knowlegde and history. He was extremely considerate polite and made for a fabulous morning out on the Gorge Highly recommend."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I refer the the camping ground right at the Nitmiluk Information Centre right near the boat ramps. We were thrilled to arrive at such an oasis, and secure a powered site nearby the beautiful pool and bar/cafe. Imagine our dismay to find the camping area trees were alive with heaps of bats. These guys screamed all night as they flew in and out. Such a shame as the camping grounds are so ideally located, and the facilities are wonderful, not to mention that you are right on the spot for the boats cruises on the Gorge. It was an e haunting night with hardly any sleep. Definitely take ear plugs if you want to stay there. The bats are protected and they are also in a National Park. I doubt they will leave any time soon,"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),This is a must see place - spectacular on every level. The tours are well run and worth doing more than once - especially if you are fortunate to visitThis part of the world at different times of the year. You get a true sense of the ancient landscape - which thankfully hasn't been ruined.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"katerine gorge.visited this attraction by air in helicoptor and well worth it trips can be made to this gorge but we chose to view from air as time was limited,had a clear view over the gorge.should imagine a cruise would be good if in area for long enough."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Went to Katherine Gorge and had a helicopter ride-situated on the road in to the park.About$140-00 for the 3 Gorges trip.Great views!! Went on into the park.Only had time for a short stay but definitely a place to spend more time.The visitors centre has lots of information about the history of the place.The meals at the centre are medium priced-about $20 for lunch each and was very tasty with varied fresh produce. All of the roads to the Gorge/National park were sealed with plenty of parking available. A beautiful ancient place well cared for by the spiritual, indigenous people over thousands of years:)"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"my wife and i went on the sunset dinner cruise, teh meal was superb, great food, well served and assited by Lucy, the crusie was intersting, we enjoyed the views and the rock formation, but expected to see more wild life"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),A perfect time of the day to see such a beautiful place.The captain of the boat was fantastic. The boat had been over-booked so there was potential for the situation to become tense and unpleasant but he handled it with great sensitivity and everybody was happy. Our young son and another boy were quite boisterous and he was able to wrap them around his finger so that they were manageable and not too noisy for the other passengers. For that we thank him..... I wish I could remember his name - but he will know who he is (the date was the 29th of August.) Much appreciated.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"When I was in Katherine with my tour group, I decided to take the two hour boat tour of the Katherine Gorge. Its quite a wonderful trip with great scenery, birdlife (watch for black cockatoos flying around), and some surprises. Twice during the tour you would need to take a short walk (about ten minutes) between boats, look carefully on the rockwalls for some Aborigine rock art. The second boat has a brief visit into a bird filled grotto, if your a reptile lover like me, be on the lookout for pythons that lurk inside (I saw one who was coiled up in a crack). One thing to keep in mind, bring water, its hot and humid even during the morning tour. Also, theres a nice visitors center with eating facilities and keep an eye out for wallabies outside."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Last visit we did the ‘Nitnit Dreaming’ tour- 2 gorges & 2 hours. This time we did the ‘Timeless Land’ tour - 3 gorges & 3.5 - 4hours. Between the 2 tours, I assumed the extra 1.5-2 hours would mainly be spent in the third gorge. This is not the case. The third gorge is only 800m long so you only spent 15 mins in it. Most of the additional time is spent swimming. As it was 39oC the swim was great and refreshing, in such an amazing location. However if you don’t want to swim I wouldn’t recommend this tour. Some of our tour group didn’t want to swim, or didn’t know a swim was included so didn’t have their bathers! They said it was a bit boring sitting watching others swim for over an hour. This is not a criticism, just making people aware what the different tours involve. We enjoyed both equally. The gorges are stunning with spectacular scenery. Definitely recommend either cruise along the gorge."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We arrived at Nitmiluk in early November at the very end of the dry season so the water level in the gorges was quite low and the waterfalls were not flowing. However the 3 gorges cruise was still well worth doing. The scenery is spectacular and the guide very knowledgable about the local wildlife and Aboriginal customs. We walked across the rocks to get from one gorge to another to board another boat for each stage of the journey. We stopped for a refreshing swim and a snack at a beautiful rock pool between gorge 1 and gorge 2. A very enjoyable morning and highly recommended.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Fabulous scenery and clean well worth a visit. Loved all aspects of the area. Wonderfull to observe how Australians love the outdoors and make very good use of the park
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),The Visitor centre is basically a commercial outlet (souvenirs and restaurant) with a small area dedicated to descriptions about the indigenous peoples and the Katherine area. A family of kangaroos (one with a joey in its pouch) was playing on the grass between the carpark and visitors centre. A great photo opportunity. Attractive place. One short walk to a lookout over the first gorge. Staging point for renting canoes or longer walks. We did the river cruise - less physically demanding than a canoe. Nitmiluk National park is a must if visiting Northern Territory.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Nitmiluk National was absolutely breathtaking and I would recommend people go and do cruise along it
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I cannot recommend this cruise highly enough for people who appreciate nature at its most stunning, combined with excellent gourmet food and wine, plus friendly service. The cruise commences at 4.30pm on a tour boat which travels up the length of the first gorge, then moors while guests alight for a short walk up to the second gorge, then get on a second tour boat for the length of the second gorge. The boat then returns to the top of the first gorge, where the dinner boat is waiting with complimentary sparkling wine and beautifully set dinner tables. The tour guide was very relaxed and informative and had a brilliant eye for spotting some of the native fauna, including several freshwater crocodiles, a tortoise and many birds. Dinner is enjoyed as the boat meanders back down the Gorge as the sun sets. It consisted of an entree antipasto plate with gravadlax, carpaccio, artichokes, candied orange, semi dried tomatoes and a crocodile bisque which was heavenly!! This was followed by a lemon sorbet and mains were a choice of barramundi or beef. We chose the barra which was served with a wonderful fresh salad of roasted beetroot, pumpkin and feta. For dessert we enjoyed a creme brulee with ginger and coconut shortbread biscuit. The young chef and waitress were both lovely. We were fortunate enough to go on a night where there were only 14 guests in total, making the experience very relaxed and enjoyable. Our young waitress mentioned it can get quite hectic when they cater for groups up to 48. If you have the money (which was excellent value, mind you) then do not miss out on this gourmet nature experience. It really is a must do!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Coming off the Ghan, they stop for several hours and it is a nice change of scenery to visit Nitmiluk N.P. Katherine Gorge has a few gorges, but there is only time for 2 on this cruise. In between you walk a little and see some rock art. Could not imagine how it would look like in wet season!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"My partner and I went to Katherine specifically to do this tour after it came so highly recommended by my family. We went on the sunset dreaming cruise which is a bit more expensive but worth every cent. The tour takes you up the gorge as everyone else is leaving so you basically have the gorge to just your tour. There were 16 on our tour but I think they take up to 22. The commentary and scenery are just sensational you get to do the 2 gorge cruise before returning to gorge 1 for the 3 course dinner, including a glass of sparkling on arrival. The food was not amazing but was still very good for the fact we were on a boat. We both had such a wonderful time I urge you to take this tour!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We rented canoes and canoed around the gorges. Excellent way to see the beautiful scenery!! There are some nice bushwalks around, although some of them were closed due to bushfires."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Had a full day at Nitmiluk-a 3 Gorge cruise, a hike to the lookout, a swim in the gorge and a 5 gorge helicopter flight. Gave us a great insight into the gorge in the short time we had there."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We spent 3 days at the Katherine Gorge camp grounds, $36pn un powered or $40pn powered for 2 people, what a rip off. Last time we stayed here it was $24pn powered, an increase of 60% in 4 years well above any inflation levels. The amenities were dirty, locks broken and out of paper for a number of days and in general disrepair. We love the national park & gorge but will never stay here again."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We took the dinner cruise which started at 4:30pm which left plenty of time to view the first two gorges in sunlight. Katherine gorge is spectacular and you get a good sense of how high the cliffs are. Hard to believe how much the water rises in the wet season as evidenced by markers. The guide on the cruise was good and had a good sense of dry Aussie humor. We changed boats at 6:00pm for the dinner. We were welcomed with a glass of champagne. First course was antipasta. Mains were a choice of barramundi or a steak. Both were well cooked. Dessert was a ginger creme brûlée. All excellent. A great cruise all round for the scenery and dinner. Would recommend to everyone.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We came here to do the 3 gorge tour, it was brilliant, the guide we had, Chris was most informative with a dry sense of humor pointing out a few fresh water crocs for us. The views of the gorges are beautiful, after each gorge you had to take a short walk down a path to gets to the next gorge but the most you will walk is 800m. Best to do the morning tour, gets really hot after 11 am. At the end of the tour you get about 1 hour to swim in a cool rock pool. Take a towel & some swimmers it's worth it. light refreshments provided, apples health bars, fruit cake & water. The whole tour takes about. 4 hours. After the tour we had lunch at the attached restaurant, expecting the usual tourist low quality offerings, we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of food, we had the salmon salad & the barra, fantastic. Menu offers sandwiches to full meals with a limited wine list. It's worth having lunch here, it rounded of a perfect day."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"When we went to the Gorge I didn't realise we should have organised the tour prior to arriving. Lesson learnt for travelling through the Territory during the Dry. Silly me, so we missed out on the tour but decided to have some lunch, visit the Visitors Centre and a walk down to the Gorge. Visitors Centre has a very informative and enjoyable Display Centre and Heritage Museum. The grounds were a bit of a hike but enjoyable with the children. Definately adding the tour to the list of things to do on the next visit to Territory!!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Another wonder of Australia's Red Centre experience. The walks and tours around this national park have spectacular views at every turn. The Rainbow Serpent is a local Jawoyn Dream Time legend of the creator of the land.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We went here as a side trip from the Ghan and had a great time. The walk was pretty full on as we were worried about missing our bus back to the train so we travelled pretty fast with middle of the day heat. Spectacular views though and so worth it. We also enjoyed the interpretation centre and the icy cold drink from the cafe :)
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Went on river cruise, and on a two gorge cruise, it was beautiful and unforgettable. The falls along the river were spectacular and to see the aborigine art on the cliffs is something to never forget,"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We were amazed at the amount of water that can go through the Gorge in the wet season
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Just did the Breakfast Cruise with Nitmiluk Tours which was fantastic. Very informative Guide. Dress warmly though as this time of day can be very cold at present. Followed this up with a Helicopter flight with the same company on our way back to Katherine.
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"It is well signed, the birdlife is great and the wallabies very friendly."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Get into it and get exploring, so much to see.....if you have the time and energy."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We visited the gorge when it was out of season and the only access was via a high speed jet boat to pass through the first 2 gorges. Best way!!!! In season it is a slow boat and takes a few hours
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Took mum up for a visit and loved it the scenery is amazing in the afternoon with the sunlight beaming through the trees
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This is a well run operation from Nitmiluk cruises. Our two gorge , two hour tour departed on time . The gorges are fabulous and its beautifully quiet. Yes, it may seem expensive, but when we returned we agreed that it was worth the money. The two gorge tour requires a short walk and change baots, which caused some people to practically jog up the path to the next boat to get the frot seats..funny to watch. The visitor centre is interesting and a nice place to sit and have a drink and relax, enjoy the view. We plan on coming back when it dries and do some more walks and exploring. Only thing annoying is that people dont listen to the guides who were funny and gave us a lot of information. Very young kids may get bored and there is limited scope to entertain them as the boats are really for just sitting and watching."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"once in a lifetime experience. a little tour up the river before the wet season, a few stories, a little hike, a pleasant dinner...expensive but worth it. If we were to do it again I would like to come in an RV and not stay at the ir ""chateau"". Wallabies bouncing everywhere. Loved it."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),Took a tour down to the first gorge and had a lovely afternoon tea with drinks and scones and cream. Quite expensive but once again you cannot do it by yourself so have to be prepared to pay. $85 pp
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The visitor's centre is not bad, with an information section about the geological history of the area and the local indigenous culture, although like many such centres in the Top End, seemed to be insufficiently lit in places. Although food is served at the centre, it wasn't open as far as we can see. Staff service was polite and helpful. But of course, the main attraction of Nitmiluk is nature. We went during the wet season, and everything is green and lush, and animals like kangaroos and wallabies are everywhere (and some are tame enough to accept hand feeding - although in generally they bound away if you get too close). We did one walk, which was the South Walk, leading to one of the few places in Nitmiluk still open to swimming - a waterfall plunging into a rock pool with some very inquisitive fish. The park contains several walks of different duration, the longest being about a week, and leading to a remote rock art gallery of the Jawoyn people. Absolutely worth the visit and the sunburn."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"If you are in Katherine with the intention of visiting Katherine Gorge - DON""T FORGET EDITH FALLS. Edith Falls is approx. 60 klm north of Katherine in the same National Park as Katherine Gorge but on a different road. This is a lovely little falls with ample swimming facilities. You can swim across to the falls - but be warned- the swim is approx. 250 meters and the below surface water temperature can be very cold. I suggest to take a swimming noodle, lilo, life jacket or similar just in case you get tired or start to cramp. Take you own food and water there is nothing shop wise there. A day trip must do."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"If you are going to Nitmiluk National Park over the ""wet Season"" a nice bushwalk is the Southern Rockhole waterfall walk. About 8.5 km return to carpark. Water tank about half way, but TAKE some water. (saw several people without). Take a billy for morning tea if you want. Best time to do it is early morning and wander back about lunchtime. Have a swim in the pool /waterfall. The more water you cross along the path to get there , the better the waterfall. The hardest parts are the initial hill climb (on a track the rangers use in their 4X4) and at the end the stairs down into the Gorge (holding the chain). The rest is general bushwalking on either sandy or rocky paths. This spot still has potential to have you on your own with just the waterfall."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We spent two glorious days visiting this park. On the first day we took a boat cruise down the gorge. The guide was truly knowledgable and rightly very proud of the heritage of the Jawoyn people and their land. Our big surprise was the food in the visitor centre. Small menu but everything was of such excellent quality, even the freshly made sandwiches. One the second day we visited Edith falls at the other end of the park. The falls and lake are wonderful. The falls are a decent swim out across a deep lake and there is a bit of current pushing away from the falls. If you are not a strong swimmer take a pool noodle and approach the falls from the left hand side."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We went out to Katherine Gorge around 9.00a.m. We climbed a fairly steep grade to the first lookout which was of the first gorge and the view was great. Then we walked the rest of the downhill loop back to the tourist centre. This part was through bush on a dirt road track and easy walking. The walk took an hour and was well worth it. We were glad we did the walk before the cruise because of the heat. There were people swimming in the gorge at the main area and having a lot of fun. We went on the Two Gorge boat cruise (two hours) at 11.00 a.m. which was spectacular. Better to do than the one hour trip because you get out and walk over rocks, past rock art to nexxt gorge where you get in another boat. The boat driver was funny, very knowledgable and helpful. There was a restaurant but they were expecting a huge busload so we avoided it."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We visited 2 locations in Nitmiluk - Edith Falls in the afternoon on the way from Kakadu to Katherine and then we did the dawn cruise with Nitmiluk Tours the following morning. Edith Falls offers both spectacular scenery and a rare opportunity to swim right under the waterfall. We did the walk to the Upper Pool and the scenery, views of the falls and the native flora were absolutely fantastic. We enjoyed a swim in the upper pool for about an hour and you can swim quite safely right under the waterfall, although do not dive in head first as there are many submerged rocks. You need a fair bit of luck with your timing as well as a large tour group arrived just as we finised our swim and things got a bit noisy and crowded. Having stayed the night in Katherine we then headed to the Katherine Gorge section of the park to do the Dawn cruise. Again in this section of the park we were in awe of the natural beauty of the park. The dawn cruise takes in the first 2 gorges which gives you just a taste of the beauty of the area - if you have longer canoeing and/or bushwalking would be great options. There is plenty of wildlife to be seen around the Gorge carpark and visitor centre - on the day we visited we saw thousands of bats, birds and quite a few wallabies. Having just had a relatively small taste of Nitmiluk we would love to go back one day and it is defintely one of the best parks in Australia."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We hadn't planned on doing the Katherine Gorge tour but it was offered for the few hours The Ghan stopped in Katherine. It was well worth the visit. Beautiful high cliffs, two gorges with a short walk between, aboriginal rock art, a crocodile, - it was something I am so glad I didn't miss. The guide's commentary was informative; he was very good at his job."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"The Northern Rockhole Walk in Nitmiluk National Park takes about 90 minutes each way. The Northern Rockhole itself is a beautiful swimming hole, and has a huge waterfall early in the dry season. We caught the ferry over the river ($14 per person) and did the walk with our 3 year old son. We took sandwiches and cold water, and our bathers. We had a great time. We had the water hole to ourselves for some time, which was nice as well. Worth the walk."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We took the 1:30pm 2 Gorge Cruise called (Dreaming). We had a fantastic time, the tour guide was very imformative. The walk between the two gorges was easy only 200m over uneven rock, my 74 y.o mother in law had no problem. Plenty of Crocs to see!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did Katherine Gorge as a day trip from Darwin, which I booked in a hurry not really researching all the providers available. I have always in the past opted for smaller family owned operators as I beleive these deliver more value for money and an overall better experience than the larger companies and my theory was proven correct doing this day tour with APT touring- A large expensive company. The tour itself was excellent and well organised starting with a visit to Adelaide River War Cemetery, followed by a stop at the Adelaide River roadhouse for Breakfast (NOT INCLUDED and cost $17 a head for buffet) . Next it was on to Pine Creek for a short stop before getting to Katherine Gorge for our cruise. The cruise included a Fabulous lunch on board before then getting off and on to another boat for further cruising down a second gorge which was spectacular. After a most enjoyable time at the Gorge we continued on to Edith Falls where we could cool off with a swim which was most refreshing. After this the trip back to Darwin, some three hours was broken up by the screening of the movie ""Australia"" on the bus, which was most enjoyable and fitting. A further dinner stop back At Adelaide River Road house (another $17 at your own expense) and homeward bound. My shortcomings with this tour were the cost and value for money and the tour guide himself. It was quite obvious that ""lindsay"" must be due to retire shortly or if not - he should as his commentary was monotonous and tiresome. He was completely unenthused and even somewhat rude to some of the passengers who would enquire as to what was happening next, getting a short a response from him of Wait and you'll find out ! Not good when they charge you $200 a ticket for this trip. I had my husband and two kids with me also so having already outlayed some $680 for the four of us I was unimpressed with a further $17 a head x 4 for breakfast and dinner, so we opted for a pie at the service station on the way back. Fantastic tour and definitely worth going to Nitmiluk National Park for the day, but avoid these big tour companies like the plague - do your research !!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We visited the gorge late April so it still had a lot of water running through it from the amazing wet season they have had. Only 2 gorges were open but even this was enough. The gorge is an amazing place and the guides are really interesting to listen to. We were even lucky enough to see 2 crocodiles during our journey. If you are ever in Katherine even just for the day, make the trip out to the gorge and take a trip. It is well worth it."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This place is so beautiful. We were really sad that we didn't stay for more than one day, and if we ever go back I want to go camping there. The staff at the centre were so friendly and helpful. Eventually we went for a helicopter ride, and loved loved loved it. The pilot at airborne solutions was informative and very friendly. Definitely do this it's a great way to see the gorge."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I think the Katherine/Nitmiluk Gorge was one of the highlights of our Top End trip. We stayed in one of the chalets and were so impressed with the accommodation. It was spotlessly clean, very comfortable, nice quiet air conditioning, and the best thing was walking out of the chalet on the morning of our Dawn Cruise to find wallabies everywhere! They were so cute, some with joeys, and not the slightest bit worried by us. I also thought the poolside food was very efficiently organised and really tasty - my steak was delicious, and perfectly cooked. We were only there for one night (would stay longer next time) and did the sunset lookout walk (steep, but with lovely sunset views) and the dawn cruise. This is a very well organised place, and a definite must visit for anyone in the Katherine area."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We found our 4 day tour in Nitmiluk excellent. Our accommodation was a brand new cabin in the camp site with our own bathroom and kitchen. The wallabies came very close and colourful birds flew around. The first day, we had a dinner cruise on the Kathering Gorge with very good food and wine and of course some of the best rugged scenery in the world. The second day we were given our own vehicle and sent off with a very large picnic lunch to do the local sites, which we found interesting. People were friendly and helpful around this area. The third day was a highlight as we were taken out to an Aboriginal community in Mayallaluk, where we learned about finding bush food, flax weaving, rock art, ate kangaroo tail, watched a fire being made from sticks and learned to throw spears. On the last day, we could choose between canoeing or bush walking. The staff at Nitmiluk Visitors centre were very helpful and bent over backwards to see to our every need. The chef was great. In all, we thoroughly recommend this 4 day trip for anybody. It is different and interesting and not as expensive as other tours around Darwin."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did the two hour Panoramic cruise along the first two gorges. The tour was very informative with our guide explaining a lot of the traditional history of the land. The boat cruise was great and you really get to see some of the most beautiful scenery while motoring up the gorges. We initially wanted to do the dawn tour, but they had already been booked out several days in advance. I would recommend booking before you get there if you really want to go on one of the more popular cruises. We planned for two days in katherine, but only half a day at the gorge, but I now wish we had spent a full day there! Many people had hired canoes and were swimming up in the gorges which looked amazing and was an experience I wish I had. A truely spectacular place!"
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Although we only spent half a day at Nitmiluk (Katherine) Gorge, we absolutely loved it. We were there in Aug 2007 (""the dry""). We got off to a bad start by turning up without our 'swimmies' and with no firm idea of what we wanted to do. My advice - do some research beforehand and get your accommodation's front desk to book you on a cruise in advance (if you don't opt for the canoeing instead). We opted for the 4-hour afternoon cruise, to the end of the 3rd gorge, which allows a stop for a swim and a snack on the way back. We had to head back to Katherine for our swim gear as we did not want to pass up the opportunity to swim in the gorge! The cruise was fantastic. I thought 4 hours might be a bit long (specially for our 6-year old) but the time flew by. The scenery is absolutely stunning, and we saw a couple of harmless freshwater crocs. Due to the relatively low water levels, at the end of each gorge we had to leave our boat and walk to the next boat in the next gorge (the walking is not strenuous, about 2km in total, and you get to see some Aboriginal rock art too). At the end of the 3rd gorge we got out and climbed up the rocks to look at the vortex holes. This trip was definitely one of the highlights of our holiday in Australia."
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I went to Katherine Gorge with my friend and we had rented a canoe for the day. It was really a great experience, since we were able to paddle the first 3 gorges, have a picnic and a swim and head back to return the canoe by 16:30. I highly recommend renting the canoe for the whole day, because if you rent a canoe only for 4 hours (half a day) you can only paddle in the first gorge, stop for a swim and paddle back, which is a pity since the second and third gorges are far more beautiful than the first one. When you reach the end of the first gorge, you leave your canoe on the bank, walk a little bit on a boardwalk, and get a different canoe on the other side of the rapids. But when you reach the end of the second gorge, you have to carry your canoe over the rocks, and it is extremely heavy. I really believed we wouldn't make it, and we decided actually to push the canoe through the rapids while walking along in the water. There is a limited number of canoes allowed beyond the first gorge, so booking ahead is recommended. You don't have to be an experienced paddler, you just need a good level of fitness."
