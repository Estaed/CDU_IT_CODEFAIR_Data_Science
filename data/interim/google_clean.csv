GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,TheNomad.family had a wonderful day at Desert Park. You could literally spend the whole day there. There's a clear program with interesting talks and a bird show. There are also beautiful hiking trails and birdwatching spots. Even though it ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,Get there before 10.15 so you can be seated before 10.30am for the bird show. What a highlight.

GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Wow, yum, I will never be eating a tart again if it doesn't have ants in it, that's how inert and drudging that was, also what would you call this structure in the woods, it gave me a sense of purpose and I'd like to know more about it, also describe the tool bus."
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,The Alice Springs Festival of lights was an amazing event. It was so nice to see so many people supporting this event. I thoroughly recommend people to visit the festival of lights and enjoy the rich culture of the Northern Territory outback.
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,My wife and I have been here twice and loved it both times. We did the Nocturnal tour last night with my wife's parents and our son... and it's absolutely one of the coolest and most unique experiences. Highly recommend.

GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You'll have one of a kind experience here. You'll get to enjoy the mountain view, see various animals, flora and bird show. If you have more time, you gotta watch in the cinema. The ending was simply dramatic. Have fun!"
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,For a group tour arrival there should be someone to do a walk around to talk about the places and themes of interest independent to the theme park timings. Afternoon show of the birds at 3pm was excellent for a short presentation.
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you are in Alice on holidays this is a great place to see many different as pets of the flora and fauna of the Australian outback. Great Ranger, talks and displays. Disappointing there is no cafe, after walking the 6 kms from town to visit."

GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,We spent about 3 hours all up including the bird show and guide talks for the nocturnal house and numbats. Well worth it. Cafe was closed when we visited but there were still some drinks and ice-creams available at the gift shop. There are some refrigerated drinking taps available throughout the park.

GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,Wonderful desert park. We especially enjoyed the aviary show and the nocturnal house. My son also enjoyed playing on the small playground outside the cafe and the movie that played hourly. The cafe food left something to be desired but the coffee was nice.

I highly recommend spending a day out there."
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great animal park. The Free Flight Birds show is a must. The second must see is the nocturnal animals, wait until your eyes adjust to the dark and you'll be rewarded with many animals in they're natural habitat. There's guided tours as well. Easy walking paths for a pleasant experience."
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,The presentations during the day are great. Informative and friendly staff. Exhibits and facilities are good. Don't expect a lot of animals. 2 dingos 1 emu 3 kangaroos. Spend about 3 to 4 hours here. Mornings are best.
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,An excellent place to spend a half day. The bird flight experience is well worth seeing. Unfortunately the eagle finds it too hot for the afternoon show and aftet October show is only am. ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,Nicely laid out and well-maintained. A bit too much zoo-like for my taste with several aviaries. However it was interesting and the Nocturnal House allows visitors to see creatures that they would otherwise be most unlikely to see in the wild.

GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Such a great place to wander around and look at the park. Well set out. We were fortunate to be there as part of the off train experience with the Ghan, so had an indigenous guide and extras at the birds of prey show."
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to experience a true desert adventure. Local guides add a unique story to how they lived in such a harsh place. Five Stars
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Enjoyable and easy walking with soooo many birds! Don't miss the bird show either, they come so close and are super facinating. I only had 1.5 hours there and it absolutely wasn't enough time. Wish I'd gotten to an event held there, would be a great open air venue. I'll be back!"
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,The desert park is worth a visit - very large & well set out. Fantastic nocturnal area & a wonderful bird show were the highlights for us. Cost about $32 for entry but easily spend half a day there. There is also a cafe onsite & a theatre area. Well worth going to.

GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,Lovely park to be able to learn lots about the animals. Yordi did the bird show when we were there and it was excellent. Thank you

GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,Beautiful nature park showcasing Central Australian birds and animals. Large walk in aviaries to get up close to birds but there is plenty of birds flying around the park as well. Large nocturnal house with all the night animals as well as shows through out the day. All set against the backdrop of the MacDonnell Ranges.
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,The nocturnal exhibits are the best I've seen. Animals that are unique to the desert and not usually found in other parks or zoos. The kangaroo enclosure is a little disappointing with only 5-6 roos hanging out. The staff are great. We had an Indigenous guide with amazing knowledge of the country and wildlife.
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,Great place to see plants and birds from the different desert regions. The bird show is not to missed although at the moment the wedgetail eagle is only featured in the morning show. I enjoyed the wildflowers and actually saw more birds ‚Ä¶

GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,The displays are very well presented and allow a person to experience many aspects of Central Australia in one area. I have to mention the fantastic bird show and nocturnal animals display. And of course the friendly staff and guides round off what is an absolutely magnificent display. Kudos to everyone involved.
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,Good place to visit lots to see n do

GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Incredible Australian plants and Animals, a must see when in Alice Springs."

I would recommend attending both bird shows (in the morning and afternoon) if you have the time as it is slightly different every time. A must-attend for Alice Springs.
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,Fantastic place to learn about the central desert. If you go to the Alice visit here.

GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,Amazing experience to learn about our nature and it's habitat.
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,So entertaining with all the shows and wildlife. Really well played out and presented. Great job.
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The facilities were very good, but for the price we were expecting more from the wildlife displays. For overseas tourists this would probably be a worthwhile attraction, but for Australians this doesn't quite match the parks/sanctuaries in other cities at a similar price point."
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is such a great place. Its my favourite part of coming to Alice Springs. The bird show and all the animals are amazing. Will be coming back again when I come back to Alice. And the cafe food was very good and surprisingly the coffee tasted really good.
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Went for Partijma the light show, was beautiful."
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,"November is probably getting a little on the hot & humid side to really appreciate the stroll around the park. Although there are water fountains scattered around, as well as seating (although these are a bit sparse) it can prove a bit tiring. The guides are quite knowledgeable and answer questions easily. Definitely worth a visit."
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Such lovely team at the park, helpful and friendly. Our guide Doug had so much knowledge and was fantastic and engaging. He told us 1000 things I didn't know and if I can remember 5 things I will be very happy. Good job guys."

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Gullom Falls is very beautiful. Yellow water cruise super recommended! You can find animal around and you have nice options for accommodation.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Most wonderful time in the NT in Kakadu National Park. Must see Maguk waterhole. Mary River was beautiful too. Incredible. I would recommend Britz Sprinter 4WD van to take you anywhere. Look forward to coming again.

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Amazing national park. It has everything to satisfy every taste. Culture (aboriginal rock art), nature, wildlife... a must in Australia.

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Very disappointing to discover on arrival that most of the Kakadu highlights are closed. It is the middle of the dry and we can't visit any waterfalls. When you buy your expensive parks pass on line you should be told that these places are closed. Should be renamed Kakadon't.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Camping in Merl camping and visited the rock art jabiru. Exciting places
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"This park is one of my favorites in Australia. There are a lot of flies, but the scenery is worth it. Bring lots of sunscreen!"
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,If your staying at Jabiru then your probably here to check out the surrounding Narional Park. Plenty to see and do. Would recommend 4wd to access areas that a conventional car cannot
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Unique wildlife and nature. Visited during the dry season. Perfect for bird watchers and birding.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Great place to visit after the wet season and the waterfalls have opened back up, not much to do in the wet at all"
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Poor facilities which are not well maintained. There was no wow factor and we had much better experiences at other national parks. $50 entance fee and half the park is closed mid April. Litchfield national park was so much better and free. ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Beautiful national park. Really rather hot, even in the dry season. The wildlife and nature make it well worth it though."

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Beauty fed by perennial springs from Arnhem Land. Immense diversity of life under active management from a joint Government-Indigenous body. Truly a joy to see. If you wanted crocodiles here's the place to be.

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,One of the best national parks in Australia. Crocodiles and beautiful waterways. So much to explore

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Always worth a visit. Although very busy during school holidays.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,It's a very beautiful place but the hundreds of tourism guide groups really ruin the experience. Wouldn't recommend if you actually want to enjoy the beauty of the land and read about its history.

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Great place hot showers and toilets were ok camp grounds where nice and flat big fire pits plenty of wood around but.

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,One of my favourite places in Australia
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Indescribable. Unique. Sunrise Yellow water billabong cruise was truly great. Scenic flight one hour with Kakadu air is a must. Kakadu is ENORMOUS.

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,For the top end of Australia is one of the best views in the world. other than the south end of Australia.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,beautiful has lots nature and has varieties of animals mostly flies lots of things to look at one of the best parks in Australia which I've gone to it's a stunning place to go to but it is a place to wear suncream
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Excellent day out, it was a privilege to be shown about by Johnny one of the local senior leaders. Stunning views, amazing rock art and a glimpse of local culture."
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"We visited at the end of wet/start of dry season. Expected it to be hot but it was still oppressive. The limited time here was utilised by visiting Nourlangie Rock art site and Gunlom waterfall, which recently had the road opened. Twin and ‚Ä¶"

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"We have been there middle of may. Besides of the overpriced entrance (40$ pp), all the main highlights were closed. Of course they told us that after having paid the fees. They created """"lookouts"""" all around the park to give the impression ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Stated at Cooinda caravan park. Nice set up, pool, restaurant, good clean amenities. Great staff. Fair bit of travel getting around Kakadu but Coopers Croosing, Border Store , MAGUK GORGE, NORLANGIE AND UBIRR really good. Jim Jim falls a ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Absolutely marvelous stay at Cooinda Lodge
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Beautiful and natural. Well catered for caravans to visit. You can either stay in one place to explore or move every day to a different caravan park.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"The flight from Jabiru airport was spectacular and the boat trip on the yellow river allowed us to see crocodiles, Jabirus and other wild life."
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Stunning, Special, a damn dream!"
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"What a wonderful place. Full of interesting places to go and do things. A lot of aboriginal stories, tales and artifacts. Thank goodness for Rio Tinto Uranium mineing in the area. It has helped so many people in so many ways, like education,tourisum ect."
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Over priced considering most things are still closed, visitor information centre at Jabiru dirty and staff do not tell you that places of interest are closed but willing to take your money, save your $$$ and go see Litchfield park much better. Kakadu terrible experience."
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"The rivers cruise was good & scenic. But the other vegetation is of mediocre standard.I would call most of the trees well fed scrub.I have seen Daintree, Lamington, Mt Warning & Mt Tambourine national parks.You are greeted by ‚Ä¶"

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Today we did Spectacular Jumping Crocs, a rock carving site done by a Japanese artist, Ubirr Rock Art and lookout. Finished the day at 7pm in Jabiru. Staying at Kakadu Lodge, Jabiru tonight. Great food at the restaurant. I had Barramundi. Awesome pool!"
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Bit far away and nothing to see and noting to do much
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Probably some of the saucyest scenery I've ever witnessed got a sexy little African vibe to it
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,I have only done a few places in the national park. What I have seen has been good but there is so much more to see. You need t least 2 weeks to enjoy the while park
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"It's big, it's hot, it's for off-roading."
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Really impressive and worth taking your time to explore the extremely diverse environments - contrast the stone country with the wetlands. The wildlife and rock art are astounding.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Don't bother going there, such a disappointment and massively overrated! The roads are terrible, most are unsealed and badly corrugated. Although told by staff at the information centre that we could get through to JimJim falls, billabong ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"well, I actually thought it would be deferrent. due to the heat, the birds were nowhere to be found. a lot of the ereas burned, leaving many trails with no shade in nearly 40 degrees and humidity."
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,We went in the dry season and had a superb trip! The care and attention taken by National Parks to preserve the land and honour the local people was outstanding. ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,I didn't see any kakadus
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Didn't see no crocs but still really pretty. Very hot when we went so would recommend going here in winter
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,A true world heritage national park
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Ubirr, Noarlangi walks were amazing and worth the climb even in 38 degree heat. Rock art works are excellent. Yellow river is also a must along with Bowali and the cultural centre. Here in mid October and can't wait to come back for a wet ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,There should be a better information center as you enter the park. The map we had combined with the signage were not good enough for us to decide how to spend the day. We only found the wetlands by accident.

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,World Heritage Site is not for nothing! Effort is required but well worth it. You may have seen photos but nothing can compare to being here.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Amazing place. Must see in everyone's lifetime. Explored both by foot and by small plane over the entire park, both incredible in their own way. A part of the outback that should not be ignored."
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Nice place. Lots of road side kangaroos resulting difficulty in driving in morning and evening hours. Many many mosquitoes. Overall must visit place.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Did a tour with off road dreaming. Guide was good but didn't think much of the national park too expensive
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"The most beautiful, pristine, untouched piece of land, reflective of the ancient indigenous culture. From the serene waterfalls, the breathtaking cliffs, and the powerful cave paintings."
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Always a winning option, worth the trek to some of the harder to reach places in the southern end of the park"
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"Amazing place to see heaps of wildlife, people are great and really good with describing why and what things are and do"
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,They have the hide to charge $40 per adult for park fees and most things are closed due to seasonal or cultural closures. Will never be back.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Thanks to Ranger Adrian for a wonderful experience explaining the different types of rock art and Dreamtime stories at Ubirr. A great way to be educated about our indigenous cultures.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Thank U Custodian Johnny Reid for leading me and 3 car loads of friends on a great adventure. Jim Jim Falls and the Rock Art Anabungbung awesome places.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Roads are wide and great to drive on. Great signage about seasonal closures. Love to go back during the dry season
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Entire parks better sites were mostly closed.... thankfully we saved the fuel and went elsewhere after looking it up on the Kakadu website this was also expected to be the case after talking to locals at a few pubs earlier in the week

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Imagination could not have conjured this place. Amazing flora and fauna. A timeless history and so well looked after by the traditional custodians.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"One of the biggest national parks in Australia. A lot of wildlife can be seen all over. Be sure to visit the park during the right period of time though, since it can be stormy when you're in the wrong season. I'll visit it again when I have the chance to do so."

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Good it's different but out in the bush still go on some of the walks and it looks amazing a bit rocky for the walks but has some gorgeous waterfalls
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Three days was not enough. An amazing part of the NT. I'll be returning to explore some of the longer walks.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,I like the aborigines heritage sites and Gunlom infinity pool. The Motor Car Falls are also nice. Maybe more spectacular in wet season üòâ ‚Ä¶

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Kakadu is a national park filled with rich ancient history and the flora and fauna is a sight to see.You can spot crocs on billabongs and watch an array of local birds fly by.A must visit when your in the top end.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,So expencive. 40$ per person even during the wet season where a lot of tracks are still closed. Many mosquitos. No free camp! They try to rip you off!
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,"worst experience ever, none of the sites or places of interest are opened and in some places you wont find out it is closed untill you drive 10km muddy road. suggest to go to litchfield national park, better view and better service."

GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Must go place and had to be part of your bucket list; doesn't matter which part of the world you live.
GoogleMaps,Kakadu,Kakadont. Expect you pay for an expensive park pass and all the goods spots are closed. Over-rated and commercialised .

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"If in Nitmiluk you must try a gorge tour. I wish I did the kayak as I was told it was up current first then come back, but there is very little current. Lovely scenery and felt professional and safe!"

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Fantastic scenery all round. You can walk from the info centre up many steps to a look out and/ or book a boat cruise or self guided canoe trip up the 3 gorges. Cost from $100 - $180 pp. Amazing chilled water tap at the toilets too!!

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Exceptional! The cruise itself was informative and breathtaking. Well worth the total cost. Then came the food. I am incredibly fussy but this was next level on what could be done on a boat based bbq. The food was divine. Basically if you are in Katherine you would be a mug not to do this.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"We went on a cruise up the Gorge and our tour leader was a fantastic young man (Langdon?) Who told us wonderful stories about the Gorge's history, the crocodiles and the structure of the Gorge. He gave us so much information in a very ‚Ä¶"

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Wowzers what a beautiful part of Australia. Great boat trip and all the walkways have been built to make it as easy as possible to access But this requires medium fitness as there are lots of steps and it was over 40 degrees the day we visited. But so worth it.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),We had a very pleasant cruise to the first two gorges. We discovered many interesting facts about the gorges and the creatures that live there.

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Beautiful cruise across 2 gorges. Plenty of cold water on board to keep you hydrated. Lovely short walk to the second gorge. Captain was full of knowledge throughout the trip. Well worth a visit.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),We did a canoeing excursion and had a great time. The gorge is beautiful and it's easy to canoe to the end of the 3rd gorge. 4 stars because the price was ridiculously high
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"What a lovely place to visit. Guide was very knowledgeable. Before we got on the boat we were given a bag with a drink, banana bread,biscuit and a mandarin. It was a surprise to get the bag of food, but thank you. The 3 gorges we went down were all different. I would recommend this to everyone. A great morning out."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Definately with a visit but only way to see properly is to take a helicopter ride over all 13 gorges
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Good if you are interested in rock formation and the depth of water in the gorges Gorges
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Katherine Gorge is a must place to go while in the NT. We drove from Darwin on a day trip down to Katherine to make our visit. It‚Äôs worth the drive. The boat driver/guide was fantastic. Great commentary with a good dose of Aussie humour.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Beautiful. Gets very hot and remember sunscreen.

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Stunning! A week after we visited, the gorge was closed to visitors due to the biggest rains in almost 2 decades. We were only able to traverse the first of a set of gorges via boat as the river had already significantly swelled. Beautiful contrast between rock, water, flora and fauna."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Amazing place to visit. We're camping here for a couple nights and went on the boat cruise through gorges. Multiple walking trails and bike trail right to door steps.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Absolutely stunning. Not to be missed.

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Simply spectacular and some great exercise to boot. No one told me of the thousands of bats lining the river. It's free well signed extra parking for us Vance's. Bring the fly deterrent!
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),We visited during December. Flies swarmed us from all direction and were sticking to us like there is nothing else in their world unlike us. Don't forget your insect repellent. many places to see in one spot. Its worth it in the end. ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Fascinating, were only there for a quick 1 day tour, would have been great to spend more time there, but keep in mind that it is a 4 hour drive from Darwin (at Safe speed), and it‚Äôs really hot during October - November. So make sure you bring plenty of water!"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Did the 5k loop walk. Great kudos to the tradies who did the steel and stone work on the steps up to the lookout over the Nitmiluk Gorge.

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"3 gorge boat tour, with swim in the Lily Pilly Billabong"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"I was disappointed that the cultural tour was led by an Argentinian backpacker, not an Aboriginie. There was not an Aboriginal Australian to be seen working on their land even they own the area. An unpowered caravan site cost $80.00 per night including the fee to enter the Aboriginal land. That is $560 per week to enter the land."

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),The visitor centre is huge and inviting. However not really sure why it's where it is as it's still some distance from the launching place for the boat ride and doesn't offer any view of the gorge. So what is the point? Food and tour ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Katherine Gorge - words & photos really can't do this breathtaking place any justice. The sheer beauty and history of Katherine Gorge is something you need to experience for yourself. Being surrounded by the cascading gorge faces and seeing ‚Ä¶

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Most confused I‚Äôve been following maps, takes you to a tourist centre not directly to a gorge or anything unless you are wanting to book a tour. The centre does give you a lot of local information though but I was looking at sightseeing. ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Just beautiful. We stayed at the gorge camp grounds for a 1 night stay and it was soo peaceful and enjoyable we ended up staying an extra night. The 2 gorge river cruise was beautiful and do suggest you do it if you stay there.

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"What a fantastic place to see nature. You can sit and take it all in and time will pass by and you will be relaxed. Do the walk/ climb, its worth it."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"You cannot get photos of anything unless you take a boat tour or walk upto the lookout. You cannot get a pass out there, had to come back into town and ring to get the pass. Not worth the trouble."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"What a fantastic spot that showcases what Katherine has to offer and a definite must see while your out there. If you get the chance definitely take the cruise and if you can physically do it, explore a few of the tracks. If you can't manage a big walk at least check out the lookout spots."

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Beautiful place, amazing walks and breath taking waterfall! Great spot to swim and relax in the middle of the walk."

It was just a pity we couldn't swim as it was just after the wet season and the water holes hadn't been cleared for swimming yet.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Amazing cruise. Need to buy tickets in advance. It was hot, so take plenty of water, a hat and apply sunscreen before you go.

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"If you like cruises its probably ok but as regards swimming its a 9 km hike to the closest spot, and even then it is currently ""not recommended"". No swimming in the river neat the parking. The hikes are pretty long. Also all along the river adjacent to the parking area, picnic area are tens of thousands of pretty smelly bats."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Many interesting walking tracks, a nice kiosk with a small museum and a shop that sells indigenous art."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),As a British lady I have to complement the visitor centre for their delicious tea - proper tea leaves and lovely flavour.

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Seems to be mainly focused on long hikes or expensive boat cruises.

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Not hike friendly, accommodates people who wish to drop 200 bucks each on a tinnie. Very average. Walk 12km to a decent view."

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Horribly signposted. Views are ok without being amazing. No one at the help desk until 3pm about enquiries. Ridiculously long hikes to see gorges. You'd have to spend a week here to do all the hiking properly and be Ridiculously fit. Also now requires a park pass to visit which is understandable.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Bucket list destination lived up to expectations
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Amazing place which we enjoyed from Katherine end and from Edith falls. Beautiful crystal clear water in a natural environment. Both camping areas were fantastic. We also very much enjoyed the 2 gorge tour by boat
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),A must see when in Katherine. Spectacular is an under statement.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"The boat trip is way overpriced, so we opted for a walk on the top of the cliffs. Some parts are OK, but the views from the cliff are really nice. It may be tough to get there though, particularly when very hot. Water can be found along the way - just don't forget sunscreen!"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),I would NOT recommend camping here. The campground is not secure at all and the guests were terrorised at 1:10am by hooligans doing burn outs in the powered sites area before going into the pool and drinking with their portable speaker ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Beautiful sunrise tour with a very knowledgeable and pleasant guide; unhurried and patient; seats wet on the boat and nothing to wipe them dry so we got our pants wet before we had moved! Excellent breakfast before we took off and a hot cuppa that was most welcome and well organised. Dry seats on the boat would be nice!
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Stunning gorge, hard to get to unless paying for helicopter flights or boat trips. A few walk will get you to section. Some of the provided maps are hard to follow."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Two gorge trip was all we could get into cause we left the booking a little late. Great experience, would have loved a longer trip. The canoe hire looked like it would be fun."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Very nice scenery with a lots of wildlife such as crocodiles and a variety of bird species. The guides of the boat tour are nice and informative and explain a lot of points in detail. However, the only problem I felt was that tour did seem ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Cruising the mighty Katherine River through the soaring, majestic cliffs of its beautiful gorges is a ""must do"" on any trip to the Top End of the Northern Territory. I have visited Nitmiluk Gorge many times and it never disappoints."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),A spectacular trip up the gorge. Would love to come back and see it in the wet season
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Great for 1st chopper ride
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Bucket list place, absolutely beautiful."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Did the two hour boat trip. Stunning scenery and a very knowledgeable skipper, told us so much about the geology, history, flora and fauna of the gorges. Highly recommend."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Hm perfect spot for hulking and swimming..
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Fantastic place, visitors centre with info, hot and cold food and drinks, toilets and souvenirs. Jump onto one of the many cruises that depart multiple times daily depending on ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),You have to go to the gorge and the river cruise.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Great spot
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),stunning scenery here! you can also canoe up the gorge as i did ! first three sections very touristy ! canoe beyond this and camp on the side of the gorge as I did ! absolutely fantastic! I would definitely go back ps check to see if you can still hire canoes overnight here and do it !
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Nice when its dry season. Nice mtb trail as well.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Spectacular gorge tour, knowledgeable guide"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),The gorge is spectacular and is surrounded by some pretty desolate but beautiful sandstone escarpments covered in boulders. Lots of walking options. There is a five km circuit walk that includes a good lookout into the gorge. I also did a ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Absolutely stunning scenery. This place is breathe taking. If you are on the top end you need to take a tour of the gorge itself and take a hike through the souther rock hole. I wish I had more time to spend as someone f the hikes looked amazing!
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),I never been here before and I have been told many times to go here so luckily some friends came to visit from the south and we took a trip here we were on the 11am cruise and we have a lot of children on board but they were no issue. ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Absolutely can't describe how beautiful this place is
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Oh, what an amazing place. We went on the 2 gorge 2 hour cruise, and it was wonderful. Ate lunch at the on-site cafe, which was lovely and fresh."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Excellent cruise. The staff running the tours do an excellent job providing commentary and providing history of the gorge
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Amazing scenery... Recommend the dinner cruise - if you stay at the caravan park out at the gorge, you can walk to & from the departure point in minutes. Great food & an amazing experience."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"A highlight of our trip, the guide was knowledgeable, friendly and funny and the scenery was amazing. We went on the 3 gorge tour, stopped for lunch and a swim, would highly recommend this tour."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),I had the most amazing experience doing this cruise. My expectations weren't high with the meal. But the food was incredible and totally beat my expectations. Highly recommend
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Great experience, amazing place."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),The gorges themselves are stunning. We hired canoes and very much enjoyed gently paddling through such magnificent natural beauty. The system of queuing to check in for hiring the canoe then waiting for approx 50 people to get their life ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Honestly, the Hiking trail is more worth it than the Gorge Cruise. Alot more to see and it is invigorating. Highly recommend bringing atleast a litre bottle of water per person as it can get pretty hot and humid. There are water stations all along the trail though and plenty of lookouts. Absolutely beautiful scenery."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Beautiful piece of country. Stunning views.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),The walk was really nice to do. You can see thousands of bats hanging from trees at the beginning. You have some stairs to go up and get a good view at the top of the gorge. ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Great place, need to spend a few days here to really appreciate it all"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Very beautiful place to visit
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"The 900meter walk to the lookout had lots of beautifully made steep stairs. Turn around a d come back, the loop for 5klms wasnt worth it. The lawns, setting and restaurant was great."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Great tour, really enjoyed my time üòÉ Great tour guide, highly recommend. ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),This is an awesome place to be. Especially at sunset!
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"It was okay, guide was very good. However, one tourist (apparently so desperate for her drug that her hands were shaking too much to light a cigarette on the first attempt) smoked incessantly on the walk each way between the gorges, ‚Ä¶"

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Amazing place you should be there
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Nice campground with showers and pool , short walk to Nitmiluk center"

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Amazing place to visit and experience. We did the walk to the lookout and it was very worth the effort
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Incredible place!! This was safe and so nice for dip to cool off highly recommend a visit here
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Take one of the boat trips, not necessarily the sunrise one as it is nicer with the sun. But also walk along the river to the Butterfly Gorge and swim there - even better than the boat trip an it's free."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Their fish and chips( wild Barra) for the day was amazing. Worth driving 26km from Katherine for them. The beef burger is so tasty and beer battered chip is so good.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),We loved our two gorge tour. Such a spectacular place! Tour guides were very knowledgeable.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"**Do not visit** **Complete cash-grab** **Rude, ignorant staff** ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Gorges are beautiful. Tours are quite commercial and quite expensive, considering the amount of visitors. Monopoly is never beneficial to users. Visitor center closed on Easter 2021."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),We were on the dinner cruise and my husband fell sick due to the heat The staff were amazing They cooled him down and rushed us back to the dock so I could get him back to ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Disgraceful condition of toilets and nothing good to see. Someone should be sacked.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Awesome boat ride and short walk. My friend was over the moon and loved the entire trip. Very informative.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"It was so peaceful, and the landscape is breathtaking. I silenced my mind for 3 hours and just walked and walked. The Ancestors took care of me. It is beautiful!"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Amazing amazing tour of the 2 gorges we did - it's a must do and totally recommend it - so beautiful
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Sorry I wasnt awed. Walk to lookout was nice, view was nice. Kiosk/ restraunt exceptionaly expensive, but toiles nice"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Well worth the look, swim and walk. It was very hot when I was here so really enjoyed it. Make time for Edith falls just a little north us the Stuart."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Very pretty but the boat trips are about twice the price they're worth. Can do cheaper trips with better wildlife further north.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"A magical place, really one of a kind and absolutely worthwhile. Tour guides are amazing and boat ride is really fun."
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"Really great place, millions of years old, spectacular scenery great commentary by the people driving the boat. Great hiking and canoeing."

GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"You , mother Nature and the History together!"
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Great way to spend a few hours.
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Katherine Gorge is one of those larger than life distinations with such long expanses of water which I was lucky enough to be able to fly the full lenth of all the gorges but at the water level it is breath taking and the amazing rock art. ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),Not much else worth seeing in Katherine.

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Look I liked it but I agree with a lot of the 1 star reviews - it is hideously overpriced to not be able to even do anything... The rock is stunning tho.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you love breathtaking views, colorful wildflowers and all other beautiful things that nature has to offer then Ayers Rock (Uluru) should be on the top of your Australian Outback Trip"

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Such a special place in Central Australia. Take the time to read the signs around the rock that tell some of the stories and history of Uluru. The walks are all spectacular. If you're there at the right time you might get to see it raining on the rock - amazing!
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Three days proved to be a little less to enjoy all that this park has to offer. We witnessed dramatically different sunsets and sunrises in just three days.

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is OVERRATED! Yes, it‚Äôs beautiful. Heck, it‚Äôs gorgeous! But DOES NOT worth the money and effort it takes to get here. Everything around is very expensive and overpriced just because of the buzz around it- gas, food, accommodation, ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,An amazing view. I can‚Äôt believe that I have been here but still don‚Äôt know how to express my feelings. I travel all the way from Melbourne and take few days driving on my own. Tired and exhausted but completely worth it. 3 days looking at ‚Ä¶

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"An amazing experience, great to walk there."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Must visit. Stunning scenery. Could watch the sunrise and sets over and over again. Not that many walks - only 2 longish walks one at Uluru and another at Kata Tjuta. Beautiful informative cultural centre
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Must visit when youre in Australia. Very pretty, especially with sunset/sunrise. Basewalk around uluru was not that interesting but the walk on katja was great!"

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Life experience! The only one odd is that climbing for Uluru is limited to (let say) once in 2 weeks because of protests of locals A.

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just a huge rock but you better see it with your eye. I personally laghed out loud when I saw this rock, because it is unnaturally big and so surrealisitic."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Being here was such a blessing i loved the walk around and hiking to the top was definitely worth it.

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This place is just mesmerising. You really feel connected to the land. Best is to hear stories from the locals and walk around the rock. At night when the sky is clear the view is like you would have never seen with stars on all horizons. A must visit place.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The colour contrasts of the land for miles is astounding. Orange sands give way to pink then red. The trees change as do the grasses. Then you see first Kata Tjuka (coming from the West) on the horizon like someone has just pasted it there, ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Having visited Uluru - Kata Tjuta National Park back in the 1980's, my return visit recently, was just as memorial. The beautiful sunset glistening over the rock, changing colours, then the morning rain falling on the rock."

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Beautiful Sunset and Sunrise experience in Southern Winter

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Sounds of Silence dinner made it worth the trip. 2 days max to hike 1 day at Uluru and do the dinner. Hike Kata Tjuta the next morning and then fly out. Winter is the best time to visit to avoid high temps and flies.

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Glad I went there twice in the 1980s and 90s, and climbed to the top for a fantastic view of the bush and the Olgas. However, it's an absolute joke that the public are not allowed to do that any ‚Ä¶"

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Spectacular area, surprisingly green unfortunately the flies were in abundance."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Amazing at all times of the day. The walk around the base is good but tiring given the loose walking surface. Half the walk is close to the rock which is fantastic.

We went with 3 adults and 5 kids, youngest was 4. Probably a little too young. He spent half the 7.6km Valley of the Winds on my back which really hurt. Well worth checking out!"

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Magnificent, a wonder of the natural world and a place to be respected. Look closely as there is a lot to take in here, ancient and beautiful. Walking around this monolith you'll find rock paintings done by people thousands of years ago. It's a truly surprising place to visit."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's pretty cool, didn't get to climb it and sucks they're getting rid of it. People say you need multiple days to do the rock but you really only need one. The sunset makes up for those downfalls though, however if you live in North America you might want to save your money by going to the Grand canyon as it is a prettier rock."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We walked around the rock Great place, but pace yourself It's a long walk. Lots to see in the park like the Olga's as well. If your a walker or explorer then this park is for you. Take plenty of drinks and walking ‚Ä¶"

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Fantastic experience. Beware of the flies.. they are literally everywhere.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Incredible, much more than a rock, especially when you get up close to it. So much more details, waterholes, paintings and aboriginal history to it. The rock definitely holds a special energy and is one of a kind. The nearby Olga's are just as special. Highly recommended. A true wonder of the world. Looks amazing whatever the weather."

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The best, most diverse national park in Australia"
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Needs a toilet halfway around Uluru if you are walking. Otherwise very majestic and 5/5
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Great park for the sacred site. There was a campground where we could stop in because we arrived really late at night and they let us put up our tent on the grass which was very nice of them. The view is great but you have to be respectful of the signs when taking photos and walking around.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,In our opinion this is more interesting than Uluru itself. We witnessed both sunrise and sunset at both and not really worth the silly o'clock starting time for sunrise or missing dinner for. The experience of walking through windy canyon is great. Strange but I could feel a sort of energy at both too?
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Even thought the climb is closing there are many reasons to still visit this National Park. Walking around Uluru and getting a sense of the beauty and enormity of the sacred rock is really beautiful. I highly recommend visiting Kata Tjuta ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,An amazing place!!!! one for the bucket list so magical and spiritual an perfect place
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Great place to experience natures wonders and to contemplate the cultural significance of the area to indigenous peoples.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My first time to visit this area and did it with a 4x4 drive company while camping/swagging and hiking. Fabulous way to experience the grass roots of the outback at it's best! Raw, rugged and truly beautiful. The cultural experiences were honest and spellbinding."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A bucket list must , everyone should visit uluru and kata tjuta"
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you haven't already been here, go. It's a must see in Australia and very spiritual, raw, beautiful place. Heaps to see and do there, from the Georges to walks to the dot painting gallery and gift store and small Cafe. Awesome place, hop ‚Ä¶"

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A great place to visit. Everything is good except it seems to have a very large portion claimed to be scare sites. Just wondering if these scare sites might keep growing until almost the whole place is off the limit for photography. Will the culture of the aboriginal evolve over time to the modern era?
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Well worth visiting this iconic park. Make use of the sunset and sunrise moments since these bring out the best photo shots! ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The best thing about this park is the indigenous information, and being given the chance to learn more of the culture. Took the free guided walk with the funniest young man - he is a tour guide the park should be proud of! ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It was an amazing adventure driving to Uluru , asphalt road all the way . So much to see on the way . But do not travel at night because of the kangaroos ! You do not want to hit any . I‚Äôd go next week again if I could"
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Outstanding views especially at sunset.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Lots of flies but fine at Sunrise and Sunset when they disappear
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,One of the most beautiful places to visit in the world! If you have the chance to get a tour to Uluru in the morning and do the walk around (about 12km) I highly recommend you to take the chance! Always carry water with you at all time and be aware of the flies in the summer.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It's unbelievable how big it actually is the shadows on its face change throughout the day it's very beautiful.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Look I guess u had to be there. Entry fees very high. Visitors centre, don't expect too much and the amenities can't cope even remotely with the amount of people. I personally loved Kata Tjuta even more than Uluru. Great walks, beautiful ‚Ä¶"

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A must for everyone. Make it a bucket list thing for the family.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Breathtaking views and a bunch of great tours can be had here. Please respect the local culture and don't climb the rock. I'd also recommend avoiding tour bus areas if you're seeing the rock at sunrise or sunset, as these areas get incredibly crowded."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great park with an engaging visitor center. Sunset from there parking lot was very crowded but also quite with it. It was only surpassed by being there for sunrise. Women sell Aboriginal artwork at sunset, and some of it was quite good. ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Something all Aussies should see. The Rock is a massive thing - especially to walk around. Uluru is a magical spot and really worth the effort. Not far to drive from your Motel. Take water and good shoes AND a hat. And a camera :)
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Amazing!!! Uluru is a spectacular site and up there with one of the world's best natural wonders. Definitely take your camp chair, a cold beer and watch sunset from the viewing carpark. Would have liked more of an opportunity for interaction with the local aboriginal community but still had an amazing experience."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Once you arrive you realise how special this place is. Can't explain it but there's a real energy here.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Great place to visit. The heart of Australia definitely. During summer months the heat is terrible (40 ¬∞C) and if rained recently there is heaps of flies. During winter is much better visiting. You should not leave Australia without spending 3-4 days here and do a proper tour. Magical place.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What a great place! The national park pass is $25p/p and valid for 3 days. ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A must-see on any Australian bucket list trip

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Not worth the effort. Overpriced. Everything worth seeing is behind fences. No longer allowed to climb. A five hour road trip from Alice Springs and then five hours return. You have to be keen.

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Probably one thing you need to do but honestly 2 nights is more than enough. Rock is pretty cool at sun up and sun down but otherwise..... Kata Tjuta the same. A little more interesting hiking on KT. Also flies are awful. Need a fly net to walk around hotels. At least they don't bite.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Amazing. It was so much bigger and better than I expected. Spent 4 days driving there from Sydney and another 4 to drive home was well worth the trip and only spent 2 nights at the camp ground. Wish I had more time to spend there
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'm not spiritual or religious, but there is something about this place that I can feel. Have been many times over the years and love it every time. I personally prefer Kara Tjuta at sunset, but you do need to see Uluru sunset for yourself. ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Too commercialised now. Everything costs $$$$. Photos are only permitted in certain areas. ‚Ä¶
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Can't wait to go back. A gift for all Australian's and their friends
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Totally excellent. Don't miss it. Visit it once, yourself. (In contrast: our last time here miserable because of a famous local organised tour operator. Always wanted to be at the next station at a certain time and we only had 3 hours each to see Uluru and Kata Tjuta)."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Beautiful place. We liked the Olgas more than Uluru. The walk was better there, more natural and less tourist like. The cultural centre wasn't great, wouldn't go there again. We are unlikely to visit Uluru again, buy may visit the Olgas again if passing through. Good place for photography and sight seeing."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It is truly an amazing part of Australia that you don't appreciate the culture and beauty until you experience it for yourself. No need to climb rock either we learnt so much and saw the entire rock on a sedgway tour around the base. Highly recommend.

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Lots of stunning walks to complete. Take a tonne of water and sunscreen.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A breathtaking place that is a must see and lifelong memory.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uniquely Australian don't miss out on the walks and the stunning scenery..
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is a must for anyone visiting the Australian Centre, uluru has a lot of cultural value to the Aboriginal people and is a spectical to see. Tjuta was also a great hike with some amazing views I recommend starting this one early though to avoid the mid daytime heat."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Worth the effort. If you expect everyone there to respect the cultural lessons made available to you upon arrival, you will be disappointed. That said, go to the cultural center first (as suggested by the traditional owners of the land and the park guides). It will enhance your experience to know the stories."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Disappointing waste of time. Expensive to get in and you can only go for a 3 day pass. They close the the walk up over nothing. ‚Ä¶

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I would have given it 5 stars if the enterance fee wasn't so high $25 per person is a rip off. Cultural center was well worth a look through. The BBQ'S near the cultural centre were very handy and worked well. The Rock is always fantastic every time I see it up close. I will be back again some day.

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Just amazing. Absolutely worth coming here to visit.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Posting this late May. Flies are persistent and will swarm so think about getting the net unless you dont mind constantly waiving them away. The clarity of the light is beautiful. You haven't seen a blue sky until you've visited.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is like nowhere else on earth. Majestic from a distance and staggering when you stand immediately beneath it. I recommend the free Ranger guided tour that leaves from Mala carpark every morning at 10am to discover the significance of the site to the Anangu people.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Words can't seem to describe the power Nature provides when you witness the spectacular views of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Definitely worth adding to your bucket list. I can state proudly that I have done this visit twice, and rate it without any faults or complaints."

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is even better than the photos. The free 10am ranger guided walk along the Mala Walk is a must-do before completing the circuit of the rock. Kata Tjuta is a more rugged terrain but worth the effort. Best visited in the cooler months.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru was an amazing place love the Magic Rock! and the rest of many different beautiful scenery around the places. One of my memorable experience.

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Fooluru as the coach drivers call it, is quite a site to see. Especially if you climb the sand dunes which also provide a great view of the saltwater lakes behind them. If you pull up on the way to Uluru, do take care crossing the road if you wish to climb the dunes for the better view."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Beautiful, if you want to see the rock when it is quiet then i recommend going in the morning. Also the walk around the base of the rock is gorgeous so you won't miss out by not climbing it."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Wonderful place! Just spoiled by the people that don't understand that is sacred to the aboriginals and you are NOT supposed to climb it. Why the government even let that happen? Also sad to see who all the aboriginals got kicked because of tourism!

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The park is well signposted and the walks are challenging and graded with markers. Roads in good condition. However car parks are way to small so go early before 10 if you want to do the walks especially the valley of the winds *take descent walking shoes or boots not thongs,"
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What an amazing place to visit. I was lucky because I was working at Docker River and had to drive past thos gem. All I can say is it is absolutely amazing. The Rock is amazing but to me this was even better :) only my opinion though :)
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,You really must come here and see it for yourself to witness the awe-inspiring rock. No amount of endless tourist images can ever do this Justice. Just take my word for it and come here. The damn thing is just so big. It is a truly spiritual experience.

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Such beauty and contrasts. A must do on your bucket list. We have been here many times over the years and never get tired of coming back. Absolutely beautiful part of Australia.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you are at the Rock, you need to do the trip out to Kata Tjuta. You won't be disappointed. You will need to make sure everyone has visited the toilet before entering the park as you won't find much in the way of facilities appart from the visitors centre and make sure you take ample water with you."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Definitely a seventh wonder of the world. The geographical history is amazing but for me the spiritual history is what makes this area of the world a wonder of the world. I highly recommend guided tours to get the run down on the Australian Aboriginals' teachings and beliefs of how this area came to be.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Absolutely breathtaking! A must-visit for nature lovers!
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The significance of Uluru to the indigenous is fascinating. The colours of the ""rock"" are ever changing. The Cultural Centre is a must visit. Kata Tjuta is the ""unsung hero"" . It is very different to Uluru being many mountains and not one monolith so comparing oranges to apples a little however it is stunningly beautiful."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Why am I paying a fee ($25) that is valid for three days and is payable per person? No concessions or the like, no facilities inside the park other than a 'cultural centre,' and further payment is required for areas such as the sunset dune ‚Ä¶"
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,No visit to Australia is complete without visiting Uluru. A truly breathtaking natural structure and the history that goes with it. I would recommend a scenic helicopter flight to really appreciate this natural wonder of the world.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Spectacular beauty of nature, five stars for the nature. It is a costly exercise to visit Uluru. There are hardly any domestic visitors, highly commercialized but it is worth visiting and witnessing the sun rise&set for the true colours of this place...."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru, Kata Tjuta an Aussie must see once in a lifetime and an international visitors hot-spot. Ancient culture combined with spectacular scenery mind blowing all natural colours and flora and fauna you just have to see to believe."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well, this a place you have to visit in Oz. I am sure that all the aboriginal stuff is interesting, but it doesn't get me going. I didn't have time to find the local geological museum, but I would have liked to find that for balance. Sorry guys, was personally underwhelmed."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The Rock is definitely huge although the Olgas are much more interesting. Our excursion was part of a cross country train expedition on the Ghan. Unfortunately we had somewhat cloudy weather and never saw a sunrise nor sunset over Uluru but we had really great tour guides who taught us all about native culture and way of life.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Base walk 110% worth it (felt no need/want to go against traditional owners' wishes and climb) Sunset and sunrise platforms are better reversed if you are looking for less crowds and sillouette shots.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is a awesome natural wonder and I am glad I visited - pity about the entry cost - only stayed about 20 minutes and it was 25 AUD. Maybe if I had time to stay longer it would have been ok. More payment options needed.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Yes- it is totally worth flying to the middle of Australia to see a rock. Its by far the biggest rock you will ever see and the surrounding landscape is incredible. Don't go in the summer!
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This place is incredible! You must visit and do the walk. Make sure you do it early and have sunscreen and a hat and water. It gets very hot. Some parts a a bit difficult but well worth it!
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Awesome experience to visit this place.I wish to visit this again and again.very nice
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I don't need to write any comments about Uluru, everyone knows. Entry is $25 per adult into Kata tjuta national park. Base walk around Uluru takes about 2-4 hours.

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The visit is worth the trip. Nothing can compare you for what you see once you stand in front of the Rock. The views are worth the heat but you need to be careful to take enough water and a hat with you. The heat will flare up within minutes.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Remarkable and anbsolute respect, there seems to be many spirits no menace instead a merged dream like and yet aware land. This nations land has been one of the most beautiful experience in a land that gives."

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Arguably the most remote natural wonder in the world. Just to get there is a very expensive effort. One of the worst ""tourist traps"" I have encountered. Money grab, drunks and abusive language is what I remember of the rock. The Olgas were much better."

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Great experience
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Top place. It's as good as Uluru.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Great experience. Tonight we watched sunset at Uluru.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Nice but they steal you 25 bucks to get in the park. Also: no drones allowed but you can have an helicopter ride. Why? Because they make profit out of helicopters but not a single cent from drones...
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is a very fantastic place to visit i would recommend everyone to visit here
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,No wonder it's the most iconic memory of Australia for many

GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The most spiritual place. Mother earth at her best.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Everybody loves Uluru. It's a great park and wonderful to visit. A pass for 3 days costs $25 (most likely to go towards upkeep and the rangers) .
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Unbelievable experience! If you are visiting Australia you must visit this Aboriginal Sacred Icon.
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Truly beautiful! The only downside is the flies. There are so many flies! Make sure you bring a lot of bugspray, these annoying flies stick to your face if you don't."
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I touched the rock and the dreamtime spirits sucked me into the ground. I would advise you not to touch the rock as it took me 4 days to get out of the dirt they pulled me into.
