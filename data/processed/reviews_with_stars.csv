TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"First time experience at Uluru so much to do and see thats for sure , The colours from sunrise to sunset are just a magic experience, We stayed 3 nights at the Resort right next door to this iconic landmark. PS"" Uluru climb in Northern Territory should be banned WE GOT TO EDUCATE NOT DISCRIMINATE",3.8
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went here as part of our tour with The Ghan. Had we not done a guided tour our experience would not have been nearly as good, so I highly recommend a guided tour. Our guide Ruben was brilliant. His knowledge of the animals and plants was just phenomenal. He was extremely engaging and I think I can speak for everyone we spoke to on our journey, he really made our experience unique. He had an awesome sense of humour too. We saw an emu and dingo, and those animals within the nocturnal enclosures, and the bird show was really enjoyable!",4.8
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Thanks mate, tis the closest I will get to it. Uluru has been in my dreams since was about 12 years old. Never had the chance to go though, although my whole body wanted to something always in the way. Now I am 62 and struggle to walk around my 2 acres.",4.6
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A must do!! We hired a car & visited the rock numerous times over 4 days. The hikes are amazing. Make sure you view a sunrise & sunset as the colours are phenomenal. Also, make sure you purchase a fly net to cover your face, the flies are atrocious. Was absolutely blown away by our visit!!",4.9
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Best way to do it is to hire a campervan. I know not everyone can do it but in 2021 we did just that, flew in and hired a campervan at Darwin, made our way down to Uluru and flew out of Alice. Took us 10 days. Wish we could’ve done it for much longer.",3.6
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"it's much easier to ""take responsibility"" when you get a decent start in life. have a listen to what the principal of this is decades in the making from the way successive Australian governments (and voters) have treated the problem Gavin Morris is the principal of Yipirinya school sets it out well... - 17 town camps surrounding Alice Springs have diabolical living conditions, and that needs to be addressed - local leaders and Aboriginal service providers need to step up immediately - implement a child protection system, which is fluid, culturally appropriate, and nuanced to the Alice Springs community",3.5
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Make the decision to make the most of this adventure and you won't be disappointed. Take your time, listen to the talks on various animals and read the info boards available. It will help you experience the full spectrum the park has to offer and you'll come away amazed at the beauty of Australian nature. The exhibits mean you see so many animals you would rarely get to see - and the nocturnal house is one of the best in the country for diversity and display. A great day out if you want to explore Australian nature. It's not really the place for a quick look - delve a bit deeper and you'll really be rewarded. Will be back.",4.2
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This was a highlight in our visit to Alice Springs. The organisation and professional attitude of all the staff made it a very pleasant day. We enjoyed a nice fresh lunch in the cafe and then wandered around the well kept exhibits. The Bird Show was excellent and exhilarating with the wedge tailed eagle as the star! Would like to give a mention to Matty who gave us great information and steered us in the right direction. Well done!!,4.5
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What an amazing place! We respected the aboriginals request and rode around the rock and walked through the cultural centre. The experience is understanding what the majesty of Uluru meant to them and not walking over their sacred place. The view around the rock close up is truly mind blowing. I will be back to ride around or walk it again. Sunset viewing is awesome,4.9

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I just arrived back from a few days at Uluru spent with my wife and a friend couple. Whilst I have never had a compelling desire to see the “rock” I was so pleased I did. It was much more impressive than I believed. The stories of aboriginal culture including bush tucker, hunting, land management, and dreamtime were just fantastic! The cost for this trip was not cheap compared to say SE Asia holidays, but given that everything must be transported into this remote site, it is somewhat understandable. The Sails in the Desert where we stayed was good with reasonable service standards, whilst not being exceptional. The rooms were large enough, clean, and comfortable. The hotel restaurants were good, but don’t expect 5-star cuisine. The staff were very friendly but not without fault in terms of speed of service. The Yulara “town” seems to struggle a touch to deal with the substantial tourist flows which seem to come from all corners of the world. Overall, Australia should be proud of the site, the aboriginal heritage associated with it, and the management of it. We booked a couple of the tours and plenty of the free aboriginal culture sessions which were all great. However, the field of lights we found somewhat contrived and underwhelming. We had a great time and I was so glad I got to see this magnificent geological and cultural icon.",4.0

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I flew into Yulara for a 4 night stay which was not enough as also travelled to Kings Canyon and Kata Tjuta (the Olgas). I can highly recommend the walk around Uluru. We (a couple of friends and I ) had hired a car so drove out there and went to the cultural centre and got advice and maps... The walk is easy and flat ...I think about 11 ks ...we were a group of 3 in our 50s and 60s ..not ultra fit but it was easy to do and gave you a real feel for the area. I recommend going off and viewing all the water holes etc...which adds to the walk. We packed plenty of water and our lunch. They have nice places to sit ...beautifully carved benches under shelters maybe about every 3 or 4 ks. They also have dirinking water about half way around. There are maps telling you where you are in relation to the whole walk every 2 or 3 ks. We found a beautiful place by a waterhole for lunch. We were mesmerised by the people climbing the Rock. I did not want to do it as want to respect the Aboriginal peoples wishes but also do not like heights and this is a seriously scary thing to do. Apparently 30% of people who visit Uluru still want to climb it ..but when it drops to 20% they will then ban it. 37 people have died whilst climbing it and you can see some plaques for them. We really loved walking around. You can bike ride or Segway around it but I think with walking you get to experience the sights sounds and feel of Uluru so much better.,4.0

Once you’ve paid you park fee 1-3 pass $25 per adult $65 per family, you can have hours in entertainment and education and you can come and go when we you like. Entry to the park closes at 7pm but you can stay in there for ages and enjoy the stars. The rock has so much to offer. Around every corner it has something new to show you. It is an easy walk around the rock 12.6kms in bush paths. You don’t need to spend a cent once your in the park. We stayed and witnessed sunset. Go early to the car park to get you spot.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My husband, our 1 and 1/2 year old (in a child carrier on my husbands back) and I did walk/climb up the rock and I'm so glad we did. It was amazing, the beauty and magnitude of it is unbelievable. You just can't grasp it in a picture! The first section is very steep and has a chain to hold onto. There are few spots to stop and rest. The rest is undulating until you reach the end of the track. The Rock is closed in high winds or when rain is forecast, so pick your days well. It is most definitely the highlight of our trip there. Also take a hat and lots of water!! The rim walk was a long 12km walk in the sun. It was nice, with a few nice gorges and aboriginal paintings to look at along the way. (I did see that there were Segway tours and would have preferred to do it that way) you can drive to the scenic points along the way, if you don't want to walk it. The track has very little shade. So again, take hat and lots of water.",4.7

In addition, the talks given by indiginous rangers on a variety of subjects about life in the arid zones, help to broaden knowledge and understanding of the ways in which people survived before white settlement.",4.3

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru in Winter and yes the mornings and evenings are cold but the days are just perfect. A good time of year to visit as there are no flies. From the minute I saw Uluru from the plane I was mesmerised by its presence. You cannot take your eyes off of her. She is grand, she is magnificent and she is captivating. It is hard to describe the feeling you get when you visit here. As others have pointed out buy your park pass beforehand as the line is a lot less shorter. Sunrise is amazing but in my opinion sunset is a lot more spectacular, colour wise. I highly recommend hiring bikes to see the base of Uluru especially if you have children. Fifteen kilometres is a long walk! Visiting Uluru can be expensive but if you are organised and your dates are flexible you can find some really reasonable flights. You can also stay at the camp site which does have cabins if you do not have a camper trailer. Once you pay for the park pass ($65 for a family for 3 days) you don't have to pay a cent. We brought our own picnic and there were lots of places to sit and eat. I highly recommend having lunch at the sunrise spot. Lunch with a view! Until October 2019 you can climb the rock but be warned it is not open all the time. They do shut it if the temperature reaches 36 degrees Celsius or if it is windy or raining. On the afternoons we were there it was open from 3pm-5pm. I was actually quite surprised how many people walked to the top.

Opening line: > Uluru (/ˌuːləˈruː/; Pitjantjatjara: Uluṟu [ˈʊlʊɻʊ]), also known as Ayers Rock (/ˈɛərz/ AIRS) and officially gazetted as Uluru / Ayers Rock, is a large sandstone formation in the centre of Australia. It is in the southern part of the Northern Territory, 335 km (208 mi) southwest of Alice Springs.

Twice during the tour you would need to take a short walk (about ten minutes) between boats, look carefully on the rockwalls for some Aborigine rock art. The second boat has a brief visit into a bird filled grotto, if your a reptile lover like me, be on the lookout for pythons that lurk inside (I saw one who was coiled up in a crack). One thing to keep in mind, bring water, its hot and humid even during the morning tour. Also, theres a nice visitors center with eating facilities and keep an eye out for wallabies outside.",4.3
Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> If youre an explorer and like going places that not many people go to then whats so special about Uluru, probably the most famous rock on Earth? And why climb it, a place that thousands of people climb yearly? I already climbed it in the 90ies before it was unacceptable to do so, i've climbed most of the major mountains at this point - still got some more i want to climb though. Respect the land is the motto but that means don't litter/destroy the place etc. That is not the same as don't go some where due to people's made up beliefs that it is sacred. Thats a human thing not a nature thing - the land doesn't give a shit about that. >Like I said its really not that hard to just not be disrespectful, being disrespectful is an active choice and choosing it makes you a dick, no 'if's or 'but's. Everyone has a different level of what is considered disrespectful. There is nothing edgy about me rejecting made up beliefs on natural landscapes.

There are old aboriginal caves situated here and there at the base of the rock and because we walked this in spring plenty of desert plant life all around. There are signs posted with information of each site along the way. A good 2-3 hours walk. Enjoyable walk without it being too hard. Take plenty of water. Just best to beat the heat of midday.

We wanted to explore at our own pace. We wanted solitude. We wanted to be able to take time to enjoy what ""floats our boat"". Are we glad we did. After the initial queuing and waiting to get away, we find we get a bonus Gorge cruise to get past the Croc nasty part of the Gorge. Such a serene experience at 8:00am in the morning when everything is just ""waking up"". Once we were in our canoe and off on our own the true wonder of the Gorge emerged. We could drift silently at the base of the million year old cliffs, hear the water dripping from the cliffs, look under the overhangs. We had such a great time. There was no rush to get to the end of Gorge 3 and the portering was not too much of a challenge for us 50 year olds. We enjoyed a relaxed picnic brunch (self prepared) before making our way back in time to get the boat trip back. We had a great time, did not feel any stress about timing and took away some awesome photos and memories.",4.0

The park is divided into 3 main ecosystems, Desert River, Sand country and Woodland. There are regular discussions around the park all day. We then went to the bird feeding time at Desert Rivers, our guide gave a brief description of each of the birds and managed to get the Rufous Whistler calling. At 10am daily is the free flying birds show, this was great to see the great Australian raptors fly so close to you. There was some great commentary as well. At 11:45am Bird feeding time Desert Rivers The most enjoyable and amazing section for us was the Nocturnal house.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"By which I mean 1) The Uluru base walk. Difficult to get the full perspective when you are up this close, but still magical to walk around it and although there are plenty of information plaques, it is worth doing it with a guide who can explain some of the dream time stories at the various points of interest as you go round. 2) The Sunset viewing platform. Spectacular and it doesn’t actually matter how many other people are watching it with you, it’s still magical. And one of the few attractions when you should constantly take pictures as the camera lens will detect the subtle changes in the colour of the rock better than the human eye. 3) The sunrise from the Kata Tjuta sunrise viewing platform. Yes, you see the sun rise behind Uluru but to be honest the colour changes of Kata Tjutu are probably even more impressive.",3.9

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We spent the first day doing the ranger walk and talk. Found it very informative and also the teachings of the elders to the younger children is good. We were requested not to photograph certain areas due to cultural sensativity. Which we respected. We went through to the other areas which were lovely. After the tour we returned to the car and went for a drive around the other side of the rock. Where we went past people clearly walking past the signs of sensitivity and taking photographs of these areas which we were appaled at. We returned to Uluru after Christmas lunch and went for a walk around to the other side of the rock. and as soon as we reached the swimming hole area is started to bucket down with rain and we got some amazing photos and it turned out to be a very rare event with the amount of water that was coming down the sides and creating the most spectacular sight we have seen for a long time. It was worth getting drenched for. We hope to return in October 2017 for our wedding anniversary.,3.0

They have a few Australian animals but mostly they have a lot of lovely native plants with boardwalks to stroll along. They have some great informative sessions about Indigenous culture, bush tucker/medicine etc and I enjoyed the bird show. We were a little disappointed with the cafe as the kitchen closed at 1.30 (we were there at 1.20 but was already closed) and so we were left with the option of a small range of sandwiches or meat pies/sausage rolls. They did have a nice amount of baked goods though which were yummy. All in all we had a great day here wondering around and attending the sessions.",3.3

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This national park offers a great variety of boat, canoe, and even helicopter tours to help visitors explore the Katherine Gorge system, but I came away most impressed with the extensive trail system, if only because I hadn't expected it. A relative novice, or anyone with more enthusiasm than time, can scramble up right from the picnic area to an overlook with a commanding view of the first gorge, and a look far up Seventeen Mile Valley, in an hour or less, there-and-back, or continue on the Baruwei Loop for a two-hour walk that returns you to the picnic area. There are helpful and informative signs everywhere. At the other end of the skills spectrum, an experienced, well-equipped backpacker can take 2-3 days to tramp all the way to the eighth gorge, maybe adding a stop to see Jawoyn paintings on the rocky outcroppings of the valley named for these native people, who are the original inhabitants and still the owners of these lands, which are leased to the government for use as a national park. And there is everything in-between: walks of 3-8 hours -- some moderate, others more difficult -- that have overlooks and in some cases seasonal swimming holes, with drinking water and toilets available along most routes. If a multi-day walk interests you, and you haven't got camping gear, you can arrange to stay in one of the permanent tent sites or, if you'd like to splurge, there are chalets and the Cicada Lodge, where you can dine sumptuously on 3 courses paired with wine (although be forewarned: this does not come cheap, with double rooms at the Lodge about AUS$ 500/US$350 and dinner-with-wine AUS$140/US100; chalets are less expensive, around AUS$300/US$210 for 2 bedrooms). Basically, there is something here for everyone, at every fitness and experience level, and suitable for all pocketbooks, from camping for 3 bucks a night (honor system) to a luxury stay at the lodge. But best all, to my mind, are the helpful and knowledgeable people who work here, including some who are native peoples with a lifetime of experiences in this unique environment. This park is very well staffed, and everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful, eager to make my experience here an extraordinary and memorable one. They will do the same for you. I found them to be among the most dedicated national park employees I have encountered in the many foreign forays I have made to such places. Conditions here vary greatly by season, and not all facilities are open year-round. So be sure to check online for opening/closing dates for all lodgings. Following weather reports and trends is also essential, especially if you are planning to hike the longer, more difficult tracks, some of which require specialized equipment and skills because they are only lightly marked and may be very rough and/or very steep. For good info on the entire trail system, you can request a copy of the information sheet for ""Nitmiluk National Park Southern Walks"" or search for it online. It contains brief, essential information on length, degree of difficulty, special sights, and inter-connections for 8 park trails, along with a clear explanation of the Australian Walking Track Grading System so that you will better understand the precise meaning of ""easy,"" ""moderate"" and ""difficult,"" as you plan your visit.

The presenter is very knowledgeable, and the birds she describes swoop in on queue; lots of fun for children and adults alike, and plenty of good photo opportunities. The park is full of wildflowers at this time of year (spring) and is very attractive. It was so quiet while I was there that it felt like I was there on my own much of the time. This serenity added to my enjoyment, as I was able to look around at my leisure and listen to the sounds of nature. There are lots of shaded seating areas, so you can sit, rest and reflect.

Due to the fine weather the surface of the rock was relatively dry so the climb whilst challenging, especially sections that have the chain , if you are fine with heights and have good aerobic fitness the climb with a few stops may take you about an hour up and slightly less time coming down depending on how many times you stop to take in the views or to catch your breath. Even after the chain section walking to the summit marker there are a few sections people may find a little challenging. Great views on the way up and whilst at the top you can use the summit marker to pick out landmarks in the distance.

The loop walk is 10.6 km long though track is well marked and completely flat. So, while not a difficult walk we still found it tiring, especially as we were on the track through 12-2 pm and it was pretty warm, even in June. The part of the walk on the 'other side' of Uluru moves some distance from the Rock at times and is relatively boring. Consider hiring a bike if doing the full loop as a walk is not that important to you. The most interesting bits are certainly along the Mala and Lungkata sections of the track.

You learn a lot about the animals and plants, including about bush food and medicine. The highlight for me though was the birds of prey display/demo. It was exceptional – incredible raptor birds for the most part but the interaction was a real experience. The ranger who took the show was funny and entertaining and full of great information on each bird. I could not recommend this show more highly. I also loved the nocturnal area. To be able to see these animals in as natural as surrounding as possible indoors and for them to go about their life without knowledge of you was awesome. To get to see a bilby bopping around was the highlight, and on the Eater weekend. If you get the chance to be in Alice, do yourself a favour and visit the Desert Park.

Then we walked the rest of the downhill loop back to the tourist centre. This part was through bush on a dirt road track and easy walking. The walk took an hour and was well worth it. We were glad we did the walk before the cruise because of the heat. There were people swimming in the gorge at the main area and having a lot of fun. We went on the Two Gorge boat cruise (two hours) at 11.00 a.m. which was spectacular. Better to do than the one hour trip because you get out and walk over rocks, past rock art to nexxt gorge where you get in another boat. The boat driver was funny, very knowledgable and helpful.

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's always vengeance?? That's untrue. As to your scenario -- if you could flick a switch and ensure someone would never commit another crime, although it'd be unethical to experiment on a human like that, of course you could set them free. We would no longer need prisons. Incarceration will stop someone from battering and raping for the time they are in prison. They might be worse when they get out or they might be better. Whichever way, the community deserves to be safe. of course, prisons should be rehab centres, not places of punishment. I recognised they are children in my post and said that prison is not appropriate for them. The issue is that the vast majority of children in Australia do not batter babies or commit armed robbery or rape people, so those things are not something children commonly do, and so to make a claim about undeveloped brains is sidestepping the actual issues. If we have issues that extreme, things have gone catastrophically wrong. You think no one should be in prison? That idea greatly benefits violent criminals (mostly men) and greatly disadvantages women and children. We need facilities that are not like current prisons but is aimed at rehabilitation -- while not allowing violent criminals free and while ensuring the community is safe. I'm using your terms when I mentioned ""serious criminal and violent thugs"". And I was careful to say that the children are ""acting as"" those things -- I did not say they ARE those things. My comments about FSD & FAE & abuse & drugs do indeed point to diminished capacity. I made mention of those things for that reason. But you still need to help those children while keeping the community safe. Alice Springs could become almost a ghost town if things continue, with the crime rate escalating among those who remain. Imagine that? An absolute cesspit where men, women and children are dying of crime-related reasons every single day, a place where everyone has experienced sexual abuse. Male elders have been empowered to solve issues in their own communities many times in the past, over and over. It hasn't worked. It simply isn't working. They don't have the skills or perspectives. That's why the solutions are going to come from Aboriginal women. The men will be included, but the women and children are bearing the absolute brunt of it, and the solutions must come from the women. As to your last point, as I said, children don't belong in prison. But the adults of those children concerned have repeatedly demonstrated they are not capable of taking care of their own children. They may be battling trauma, IPV, or/and alcoholism themselves, as well as struggling with the general issues within their communities. Those kids deserve to be safe and their communities deserve to be safe. As I said, something is needed that isn't prison but where kids acting in criminal ways can receive urgent help. Their families should be involved and able to freely visit, while also receiving help. Young kids cannot be roaming around at night. Young girls should not be getting pregnant. Bans on alcohol can be put into place/put back into place, and that needs to happen alongside consolation with the people involved. Alcohol is absolutely causing devastation. We need to prevent kids being born affected by it. I find it extremely sad when people state that children as young as ten shouldn't not be held criminally responsible for their actions as if that is an answer to anything. It is no answer. It holds no weight whatsoever. It provides no help for anyone. Of course children that young can't be criminally responsible, but what needs to be said is, what is the alternative? What should we be doing? And obviously, we should be doing a LOT. There needs to be programs where children committing very serious crimes young ages can be put into and receive intensive help alongside their families -- and, vitally -- work towards preventing these issues happening in the first place.",1.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The symbol of Australia, is not just a beautiful piece of nature, but a cultural experience on the local population. The surrounding infrastructure buildings are so well done, you could be forgiven for not knowing they are there. The Cultural Centre is a must visit for a history of the people of this land. We did the Base Walk around the bottom which was 10kms or so long, flat but still a challenge in the heat. The surprise was the waterholes and green areas with trees and birdlife. Such a beautiful place and so very popular with the tourists. Take plenty of water if you do the base walk. And we did NOT climb.",4.6
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We arrived around 10am to ""wander around for a couple of hours"". About 6 hours later we finally left. There was just so much to see. The bird exhibition was great. All the birds are free flying but come on cue to give demonstrations of how they survive in the wild.Aboriginal culture presentations and so much more. Another ""must see"" if you're in this area.",4.4
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This place is worth the visit, especially for the 10.00 am show- which no guest should miss realy. This show exceeded expectations and is better than Andy other show i have seen in other zoos (or aquariums, to be honnest) The rest of the park offers nice walks, and is a bird lover's paradise.",4.5

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spending a few hours here is really worthwhile to get close to creatures you wont easily see in the wild (including in the nocturnal house). The bird flying display was a highlight as are the aviarys. If its going to be hot suggest a morning visit. They also have mobility scooters for those who need them.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Our trip to Uluru was fantastic. Our daughter suggested we use bikes to cycle around the rock and that turned out to be the best. It was 35C that day and we had a slight breeze on the bikes to make it more pleasant. We were envied by walkers as we went around. The only down side was that the hop on bus could only drop us off at the cycle pickup spot at 10am when it was already beginning to warm up. If you have your own car you can pick up the bikes at 7am for a cooler start. We did not climb Uluru out of respect for local indigenous peoples. I highly recommend this way of doing it and the Outback Cycling company have good bikes.,4.5

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I’ve climbed it and the view from the top was *spectacular*. It was early morning, and the sun was rising behind us. The shadow of the rock stretched out across the desert like this long, thin, dark needle for miles. In the distance the sun was catching on the Olgas/Kata Tjuta and they looked like opals.

Having been here before and fortunate to have climbed it twice before it's a pity that has been taken away from everyone. The Red Centre is beautiful on so many levels and Kata Tjuta also has some amazing walks particularly the Valley of the Winds however, this is not particularly possible for those who are unfit or the elderly.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Our family of five plus three friends really enjoyed the day. The highlight was the birds of prey show with Willy wagtail guest star! The nocturnal house is fantastic...especially viewing the endangered Bilby. We found the bush survival talk by one of the aboriginal rangers to be the most informative and interesting cultural experience in the red centre. My husband and I wish that this was our first experience in NT instead of our last but are grateful for all that we (and our children) learned. The gardens in the grounds were also very beautiful.,4.5
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We didn't have a lot of time here which was a shame as I would have liked to see more of the shows and talks. The bush tucker lady was informative and the bird show amazing! The birds just show up on queue as the ranger talks about them and they fly right over your head in the outdoor auditorium!

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is one of those places I think we all leave for “some day”. It’s not cheap to visit and by the time you add up all the costs, it’s often just as much to go abroad to Asia and really stretch those hard-won annual leave days to the max. But this year, we needed a mini-break and decided that this was the year to visit this heart of Australia, this icon, this source of so much debate. And Uluru delivers in spades. From the moment you catch your first glimpse (and if you’re lucky, you’re on the correct side of the plane if flying into Yulara), it will take your breath away. I was - quite frankly - speechless. On the ground, Uluru sits like a beacon in the distance and looms large as you approach. The colour is stunning and changes with the passing of the sun. The surface is not smooth but full of character with crevices and caves. The play of light and shadow is quite mesmerising. This magnificent rock sits proudly, with nothing else around for miles and the horizon stretching away as far as you can see. I was in awe and suddenly realised why Uluru was the source of such passion. Which is why, when we finally found ourselves passing through the Mala car park on our hired bikes, the sight of hundreds of people tramping up the side of Uluru, the thousands of foot treads creating that white stain from the ground all the way to the top and the chain fence unforgivingly anchored into the rock was like a shock to the system. We knew all about the debate (to climb or not to climb) well before our arrival into Yulara. We hadn’t made up our mind until that very moment. It was right then that I understood why this place was so special - not only for the indigenous people but for all of us - and deserves to be preserved. We chose not to climb. It’s a personal decision for everyone and I am certainly not one to judge. But I’m content that we saw this beautiful rock, in her many guises and from many angles, in a respectful way and it made me feel good about my choice. If you’re reading this review, maybe your “some day” is not so far away ...",3.9

For me the best area of this place is the upper pools. It takes about 30 min to get there and the trail is quite steep. Be sure to wear appropriate footwear. But don't discourage about that. We made the trail with children without problems. We saw also aged person and even a couple with a baby. The view pays the effort.

To add insult to injury it is advertised as all you can drink and eat. Plus beaware that you should never go on a full mooon (as we did), plus the clouds stopped us for the star gazing tour by the astromertor.

There are walks to cater for all aspects of physical ability, we walked up the gorge quite a way past the sand bars and over the rocks for a distance. There is a hike up to a fairly elevated lookout that is built out over the gorge. The rock colours in the gorge walls are all wonderful shades of red and orange, all several billion years old.

Reddit/AbsoluteUnits,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Respectfully mate, it's Uluru. I don't know what others around the world are taught to call it these days (and it rarely comes up in conversation overseas) and understand the accidental misuse in some areas of Aus as times have changed and updates can be slow to spread, but throughout Australia (unless one is part of the backwards Hanson crowd which I'd hope no one here is) it's something that's definitely frowned down upon because based on the traditional owners (The Anangu people) for thousands and thousands of years, and in most official capacities, it's Uluru. With brackets added for reference for the benefit of older aus/internationals. May not be a super overt social rule (most people aren't especially confrontational about it), but it is definitely coded language and discouraged for a reason. Most people will gently check the other in conversation e.g. oh you mean Uluru? Yeah. Etc. Country or city. Those who still refer to an indigenous sacred site as 'Ayers Rock' (which has has been falling out of favour since the early 90's) are generally quite older/out of touch, genuinely misinformed/international or unfortunately, proudly racist. My aboriginal friends give tours here, and it's something they all view as disrespectful. Not having a go either, I share your enthusiasm and joy of knowledge, just want to spread a bit of awareness if I can for anyone who sees this and encourage others to do the same. It helps alleviate some of the burden of our first nations people, least we can do is use the correct name, no matter where we're from.",3.5

The Rock is a spectacular panorama, but for a surreal experience drive up close to the Rock's base. Climbing to the top along a designated pathway was a popular experience until 2019 when access to the pathway was permanently closed sadly because of damage caused by a few tourists and a few deaths climbing the steep pathway.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park was an excellent mix between entertaining and educational and I enjoyed every minute of my visit. The actual park is set in a very natural environment (certainly not the concrete jungle you'd expect from a city zoo) and the back drop is beautiful - picture attached. Because of this relatively natural setting, I was actually able to see plenty of wildlife independent of the park. Upon entry, you are given an audio device which plays recordings of a true blue Aussie explaining the curiosities of Central Australia. As it is a desert-themed zoo, the emphasis is on arid environments and the life which inhabits it. Of course, your appreciation of this will vary depending on your actual interest on the natural world. The bird show was excellent and we were lucky enough to see wild wedge-tails gliding around. Fortunately or unfortunately, this alarmed the galahs (as they are natural prey) and caused them to be woefully disobedient, which was very amusing. The walk-in aviaries were equally amazing. There are many species which would be very hard to find in the wild and my favourite was a particularly noisy chiming wedgebill which had a beautiful song. The absolute highlight of the park is the Nocturnal House, which is a great opportunity to see all the cryptic animals that emerge at night. The only regret I have about this place is that I didn't give myself enough time and had to rush through the end. I'll certainly be back if I ever come to Alice again. Oh, and make sure to ask your accommodation providers about the shuttle service which runs there. A bus will pick you up and drop you off from your accommodation. I found it to be a hassle-free way to get there, and totally worth the small cost.",3.9
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"My partners family decided to have a get together at Uluru/Yulara. Her niece, who has recently started a job as a travel agent, organised us all to meet up in Sydney then fly in. We normally do our own thing rather than tours but the excellent, and culturally sensitive and aware guides with AATKings and Seit are worth paying for especially as this is something that you will probably only do once in your life. We spent 3 whole days at the resort and on the last day 3 of us decided to do our own thing. We managed to hire the last available car in town (the woman at Hertz said if you stand on the roof it is a $1500 fine; I wondered why you would want to stand on the roof?). It was school holidays and the place was absolutely heaving. Camping ground overflowing, hotels full, queues for dinner and the local supermarket looked like the end of the worlders had been through it. We intended visiting the Cultural Centre which was great. Sure it is touristy but not in a tacky way and in the background it seems to be a bit of a drop in centre for the Anangu people. We watched a demo on how to make glue from a species of Acacia and it was good to watch the involvement of younger tribe members in the presentation. We then decided to drive around Uluru which actually gives you a slightly different perspective to walking around it as the road is further back. We then headed off to Kata Tjula to do the valley of the winds walk as a number of locals had told us it was their favourite place. You can walk a whole circuit but as it was getting latter in the afternoon we only went to the second lookout, about 5km return, which has fantastic views. On the way back we headed back to Uluru for the sunset and in the overfilled car park watched every third vehicle with people standing on the roof! The sunset up close was amazing probably better than the sunrise.",3.8

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We'd heard good things about the Desert Park so caught a taxi out from our hotel (about $20 for the 8km). We made sure we timed the visit for the morning free flight demo. The place was very quiet. There was quite a lot of birdlife in the shrubs around the entrance, but they were hard to see clearly (could hear them though). We had enough time so had a coffee in the cafe before walking around past the dingo talk and the gathering point for the emu talk (not strongly interested in those - have seen enough of them). The free flight exhibition was very good. There was a tawny frogmouth snoozing in the covered seating area (and pretending to be a stick when the big raptors were about) - I gather it is a resident. The barn owl was great, the wedge tail eagle was better. Apart from the ""trained"" raptors, several local opportunists were also trying to get in on the act for a free feed. A great show. We then spent a couple of hours wandering around the paths and visiting the various aviaries - some were walk in aviaries. At one, there was a local raptor sitting on top of the aviary, practically salivating over the variety of birds below it. We were able to see at fairly close range a number of the birds we'd heard but not seen well before. We had a light lunch in the cafe before asking the park staff to call a taxi to take us back into Alice Springs - we only had to wait about 5 minutes in the covered bus shelter. I gather the place is serviced by an infrequent local bus, but didn't research that further. We were quite impressed by the visit. Make sure you have a hat & water - it is quite exposed & gets hot.",4.0

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"With the pending ban on climbing (people have the right to enjoy the natural world unfettered by race, religion or politics) I set off with my two daughters to have a chance of enjoying some of the world's best desert views before ignorance and superstition take them away next year. Everything about the trip was over priced, from the flights, Park entry, accommodation and meals. Don't expect the standards to reflect the price you will pay. The level of intrusion of Park regulations, warning signs, threats to fine you for the flimsiest reasons, no parking zones, no stopping zones, no photography etc etc has become extreme and detracts significantly from the experience. The circuit walk which is remote from the actual rock along the northern boundary has signs every 100 m but its clear from photos on the internet that no one pays any attention to them. The views are also available in quite a number of books and make a mockery of the photographic rules. In the 1980s the park was much more open with tourist access to all sites except for the Mens Initiation cave Warayuki. This was with approval of the Traditional Owners. The reputation of the park was gained from this era but since Parks Australia and Board have gained control the experience is has been very much diminished, managed and controlled. Of course those visiting for the first time are none the wiser that past visitors enjoyed a much much better deal. One of the sad things was to see access to the KataTjuta Lookout in the Olgas closed. This has some of the best views anywhere in Australia. Management of the climb has been a complete debacle since the early 2000s. We were lucky to find the gate open two of the three times we attempted to go up, and managed to climb twice. On the third occasion winds were claimed to be an issue, yet as Parks do not have an anemometer to correctly determine wind speeds at the summit...rangers just guess. It appeared no different to the other days when it was open. The climb itself remains a wonderful experience and made our trip worth while. Those who do not climb will not know that they are missing out on one the world's most iconic walks. The physical nature of the climb, the views on the way and from the summit, the natural features on the summit and surrounding geomorphology are breathtaking. The second time we climbed a grass fire was burning in the distance casting a plume of smoke across the horizon. Hopefully the Park and the Board reverse their decision to ban the climb and provide more opportunities for people to climb by relaxing some of the overly conservative closure protocols. Without the climb its simply not worth your while. Suggest looking at a tour on the Larapinta Trail instead.",2.7

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Highlights of the visit were the nocturnal exhibit, which complemented our touring experience in Central Oz. There were several aviaries which were well presented and allowed you to walk among the birds. The landscaped park itself is very good and in keeping with the region. We were, however, pretty disappointed with all other animals. There was one kangaroo, the emu was ‘at the vet’, the two dingos had been taken for a walk and then were invisible in their enclosure, if there at all. There’s a bird show but that’s on early or late in the day and our visit didn’t match up and none of the ranger presentations were on. It’s a reasonably expensive experience ($100 for our family) and we didn’t feel it was worth the cost of the time with so many other attractions in Alice. Perhaps this is the impact of staff shortages felt everywhere (the cafe was closed for example). I hope that’s the core reason because, if not, you’d need a good reason to go for the money and as good as the nocturnal exhibit is, that’s not reason enough.",2.8

Even though it is a dot in the middle of a desert, it may as well operate as an island due to the difficulty in getting resources to the city as well as attract people to support/combat the ongoing issues there. Kinda boils down to historical mistreatment of indigenous folks combined with drug/alcohol abuse. The video I’ve linked (I thought) did a good job of impartially highlighting the issues around Alice Springs in an impartial manner. A good watch if you’ve got time.",3.5

Even just the walk between exhibits was relaxing and interesting, seeing the wildflowers and other plants native to this area. We then returned the following evening for the night tour, an hours trip around a different side of the park with a ranger seeing endangered species. With the provided red headlights, we managed to see echidnas, marlas, bilbys, stick nest rats, wallaby and bandicoot. Really cool. Then hot chocolate and cake to finish a lovely evening.

We pre-booked the evening Sunset, Dinner and Field of Lights tour, which allows you to watch the sunset over the rock followed by an outside buffet dinner. You sit on round tables with your fellow coach group members eating a pretty good buffet under the stars. Following this they plunge the whole area into total darkness to see stars that are normally impossible to see. There's also a very good commentary with laser pointer!

There are lots of packages on offer from the resort, special dinners, helicopter flights over the Rock, coach tours, even parachuting out over the Rock... To be honest just being there next to the Rock was enough for us, the cultural centre which explains the true history of the Rock, the aboriginal view of what Uluru means and the chance to listen to its true owners was everything we thought it would be and more. The walks are awesome, full walk around the Uluru is about 10km, takes about 2 to 2 and a half hours but do it early or it is too hot through the day. There are shorter walks. Don't even think about climbing the Rock, it is something the Anangu people do not do, do not want other people to do and strongly discourage people from doing! We respected their views and would not climb Uluru. The cultural centre is a must visit and the $25 entry to the national park was worth every cent! A great Australian experience!",4.5

But even here in Geelong, there is a massive poverty problem. If there's a poverty problem so ingrained in Geelong, i can only imagine Alice Springs. Hell Sunshine, who here's been to Sunshine? It's literally where the sun doesn't shine. That's got a massive Vietnamese and Sudanese community, and the place probably 10 years ago, looked like a actual warzone. Burnt cars on the sides of roads, trash everywhere, shops smashed in, constant stabbings and murders, gunshots and gang fights not different from Corio and Norlane. In Australia.

However, all days the climb was closed due to high winds which was a shame - the climb is very vulnerable to being closed so I would recommend to not plan to only do the climb as you will most likely be disappointed. There is plenty else to do whilst you're there! Hopefully one day we will be able to climb, but I fear it will be closed soon enough.",2.3

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"An impressive sight in every way and a true sight to see at least once in your life. Worth every coin going there. But plan ahead and study maps and walks before coming since the rock looks very different from time to time during the day. If there are even the smallest amount of clouds at sunset, you might want to plan for something different than standing on the normal sunset spot. In the case of cloudiness, I would recommend going for an opposite view and go to the sunrise spot instead to catch the rock against the red clouds and Kata Tjuta in the background. This is of course if you have time the next day for another try. If you go for the normal sunset sight, go there early since you’ll not be the only one with that idea. Many spots are partly blocked by trees and bushes so the first area is the best if you ask me. Also, the one that is occupied first. AS for sunrise, it is about 25 min drive from Yulara with another 10 min to walk to the platform. There will be trees in the way. Also, study the map again since depending on where the sun goes up, the rock will light up differently. In July the sun rises at Northeast which lights up mainly the north side of the rock. The platform is located to the south-east, so you will mostly see the shadow side of the rock. In summer, this is different.",4.0

Reddit/aww,Alice Springs Desert Park,"No problem. Yes and no. Roo's that are born in the sanctuary aren't let back in the wild because the Australian government considers them domesticated which means they stand a pretty poor chance of surviving out in the wild due to their social behavior around other roo's, instincts (or lack there of) towards predators and attitudes towards humans (wild roo's would run at the sight of you, domesticated ones *will* attack you if they are male). That being so, most of the roo's in the sanctuary were born there, are injured/unsuitable for reintroduction to the wild, in the possession of someone else and given up or in some cases found by aboriginals who hunt kangaroo's and instead of killing the joey (or taking them as pets) give them to Barolga's safe care. However, certain joey's they rescue are released back into the wild as soon as they reach their ""teens"". This is because they aren't considered pets but being rehabilitated for being reintroduced out into the wild. Barolga will try to find a suitable location that is frequented by roo's (which is much easier than you'd think, roo's are everywhere around and sometimes in Alice Springs) and release them.",2.5

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I only spent the morning here but you can spend the entire day if you can tolerate the heat. They have a very good collection of birds- lots and lots of photo opps. There is a nocturnal animal building which is really neat to see. It is pretty dark in there. I am not sure if you are able to use flash here. I did not use flash out of respect for the creatures- its not natural. Since it is Spring time, the wildflowers are blooming which made the walk quite pleasant. If you are in Alice Springs, this place has to be on your places to visit.",3.7

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Oh they do, do they? In that case I'm wrong. You realise it's the name of a rock. Nice blanket there by the way, or was that not intentional? Some care about the name, some don't. But to insinuate that the ones that do, or in yours; all of them. Would go as far to expressly tell you (me) that it's worse than being called a pedophile; which is in my opinion worse than not saying the right word for a rock. Is wrong. Never said my judgement was better. Mine is however, one that has lived outside. Touched some grass and had a coffee or two at a nice place. Nobody. Literally nobody cares if you call it Ayers Rock or Uluru. Because it means the same thing in a general conversation. Now if we're talking about a conversation you may be having by chance, with an Aboriginal that deeply cares about it, I'd go out of my way to respect them. Because it's their culture. Keep in mind the ""deeply cares about it"" because it's not all of them or common that it's an issue. Good night",1.8
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This park is small but very interesting for a few hours. In the Nocturnal House you see animals move about when normally they would be asleep.

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),We arrived at Nitmiluk in early November at the very end of the dry season so the water level in the gorges was quite low and the waterfalls were not flowing. However the 3 gorges cruise was still well worth doing. The scenery is spectacular and the guide very knowledgable about the local wildlife and Aboriginal customs. We walked across the rocks to get from one gorge to another to board another boat for each stage of the journey. We stopped for a refreshing swim and a snack at a beautiful rock pool between gorge 1 and gorge 2. A very enjoyable morning and highly recommended.,4.2
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I might be biased, because I like desert life! Like many zoos, it has different talks at set times of the day, and I learnt something new from them. It had a nice natural atmosphere. Some of the staff were Aboriginal - the only place in Alice Springs I'd been to that had Aboriginal staff. Potential caveats for those without their own car: I visited there on New Year's Day. I decided not to take the first transfer from Alice Springs to the park, and took a transfer back to Alice Springs, so I wasn't able to see all of the park, or see all of the talks. Being New Year's Day, the cafe was understandably not open. As I hadn't brought my own food, the only option was the vending machines. If you're planning on attending the night spotting, keep in mind that the cafe closes at 2 pm, so you'll need to either bring your own dinner or head back into town.

The gap is big for Australians, it’s even bigger for foreigners. But not impossible.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yes it's expensive but because of that I decided we were going to see and do as much as possible in the 4 days we spent there. Prebook everything and you won't be disappointed. Definitely hire a car through Voyages (cheaper, unlimited kms), and you have the freedom to go anywhere and do anything whenever you like (except for Sounds of Silence and Field of lights). I recommended driving out to Talinguru Nyakunytjaku for sunrise overlooking the rock (45 min drive from Yulara) then driving to the Rock to walk the base or do a guided tour if you want to learn more. If you go before October 2019 and you're adventurous, I know it's frowned upon but climbing the Rock was an amazing once in a lifetime experience and I'm glad I did it before it closes permanently, but it's definitely scary! By lunchtime you'll have seen enough and can drive to the Olgas, maybe another 45 min drive and you can do a couple of walks there too. We were back at the hotel in time for a brief rest before catching our tour bus to the Field of Lights. We spent another day driving out to Kings Canyon, walking the rim and driving back. In hindsight, we should have arranged to stay the night at Kings Canyon so we could see the sunset there and not have to drive the 3.5hrs back to Yulara the same day; 7 hrs driving in one day is a lot! As I stated in my title, it's not a cheap holiday by any means but certainly a once in a lifetime experience that I glad I did, so save up and expect to be spending some serious dollars! Kings Canyon is a definite highlight!",3.5
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The whole family loved it. We did the day night ticket. We all enjoyed the day session including a talk about different types of bush food.

We walked around the base this time, which is highly recommended to really comprehend how huge this monolith truly is. Just a note - we had read many recommendation for flynets, but chose to ignore them for two reasons - we had been to Uluru before with no need for nets, and secondly, we are used to flies (being national tourists).

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,My wife and i visited today on a tight schedule and explained our requirements to staff. We were directed on an exhibit itinerary and told a movie would be available at 3:15. This was incorrect and as a result we were denied the chance to see the film unless we returned the next day for an additional $10. This was sfter paying $50 to see the whole exhibit. Bad info and the exhibits we did see did not come close to being worth even half the admission price. Can not recommend to my fellow trip advisor reviewers.,1.4
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Easy walk to the gorge from the carpark as well as some short and easy hikes to the lookout.

The return leg leaves Uluru at 2.40pm but doesnt arrive back in Perth until 7.20am the next day. This is probably why for a vast majority of people who travel interstate.

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"https://pfes.nt.gov.au/police/community-safety/nt-crime-statistics/alice-springs Crime rates are absolutely worse under the current Labor Government, However the crime rates in Alice Springs have absolutely nothing to do with the current Federal Government. They’re the end result of decades of selling off housing commission, the closure of half way and emergency housing by both CLP and NT ALP governments since 2010, and the end of support of major community outreach programs like Blue Light Discos. Less houses for people to live in, removal of the places you could go to avoid a bad home environment for the night, and removal of activities that provided a positive connection between disadvantaged youths and the police as a means of support. The place has been downhill since Paul Henderson. I’ve been saying it since 2016 NT ALP and CLP have the exact same philosophy on how to deal with problem youths, but they only disagree on one bit, the size of the stick to use. The house next door to me in Katherine used to be a half way house for youth, 9 beds, tutors, counsellors, consoles, access to books, sports in backyard, bus to drop off at school Funding got cut and it was sold, in a 5 year period 7 houses like that were sold. The house my parents bought in 2001 was ex housing commission, part of 40 sold in a three year period, mid 2010s an apartment complex of 35 2-3 bedroom housing commission townhouses were sold to a private developer after 8 of them suffered fire damage. Two 10 unit housing commission complexes also sold between 2000-2020. That’s just the ones I noticed, how many new housing commission buildings in that time frame? Two vacant blocks currently set aside for eventual development and a 6 unit 1 bedroom complex set aside exclusively for disabled residents. And that’s just Katherine, and it gets extra resources because of the RAAF base.",2.2

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> For the Anangu people climbing over Uluru is disrespectful. For some religions, entering the temple with your shoes on is disrespectful. Or your hair uncovered. Or bare shoulders or knees. Different cultures find different things disrespectful. I don't really understand or believe in the covering the head thing Its a shibboleth. A meaningless gesture to enable people to distinguish between Us (the one true people) and Them (the savages and barbarians who think it is okay to eat meat on Friday, pray facing the wrong way, shave their bead but not their head, grow a bead, eat shrimp, fail to eat pancakes on Shrove Tuesday, etc.) The whole point of a shibboleth is to be: 1. Trivial and meaningless. 2. Difficult for outsiders to guess. The more difficult the better. Is it forbidden to climb Uluru, or is it everyone's duty to climb it at least once in their life? Can men climb it, or only boys? (Climb up the rock a boy, climb down a man.) Will rubbing your hand on the rock bring good luck or bad luck? Only one of Us will know for sure. Everyone else has to guess. (This should not be confused with *ritual*, which is usually [costly](http://core.ecu.edu/psyc/wuenschk/docs00/ReligRitual.htm), to weed out those who are not sufficiently committed.) The whole thing is deeply racist and sexist. (There are parts of the rock that men are not allowed to see, and parts that women are not allowed to see. The ancestors will be pissed off if their secret (wo)man's business is revealed to the other sex. If you believe that sort of shit. Ayer's Rock used to be a symbol for **all** Australians, regardless of colour, race, sex, creed or ancestry. Now one group, a tiny minority (the Anangu) of a tiny minority have a race-based elitist privilege over everyone else. Sure, its a pretty meaningless privilege in the grand scheme of things -- its not real financial, political or social power. It doesn't feed their children or prevent the Federal government's on-going war on Aboriginal tribal society. Its a meaningless gesture that really only affects a few(?) thousand tourists a year. But still, it goes against the core value (supposedly) at the heart of Australian culture: equality. And while, *in theory* at least I might work hard, smooze the right people, earn lots of money, work up the social ladder and become one of the privileged 0.1%, there is *no way in the world* I can change my ancestry and become Anangu. Even if there is some ritual I can perform to allow me to become a member of the tribe, that's conditional on me going along with the conservative ""traditional"" beliefs. As soon as I start agitating for change, for modernity, you better believe I'll be dismissed as ""not really one of us, he's done the ritual but his ancestors aren't our ancestors"".",2.0

It has a place in this world and gives people purpose and a moral code to build on. So long as no-ones being hurt I don't see a problem with it. The problem with this is there is no reason to assume that moral code is any good. There are plenty of aspects of religion that have what most people would consider poor moral codes. I'm not suggesting that we do away with what people refer to as spirituality, just the poor thinking that goes along with it. It's perfectly possible to have spiritual feelings and experiences without having some story to explain it all. These experiences can be explained rationally, and can still be enjoyed. Nothing stops someone from feeling connected to nature or at peace or any of the rest of that. There isn't any value in having stories that are clearly mythical at best be treated as though they are credible. The thing is, people do end up getting hurt by this poor thinking. From religious hate to quack health care claims - the source of the problem is that people cannot evaluate the likelihood of something being true, in part due to accepting other unreasonable beliefs as credible.",2.2
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Just a short drive out of the center of Alice Springs, this desert park is just fantastically well-designed to appeal to and educate both adults and kids, travelers and Australians. Focused on and designed around Australian ecosystems, one walks around (in any direction one wishes, although it's perfectly fine to follow the map from even to event) through the different areas of geological, plant, bird and animal species native to Australia. The bird free-fly event at the outdoor Amphitheater is spectacular -- make absolutely sure you make it there for that. There is plenty of information and close-up demonstration of dingo, kangaroo, and other mammals, and the nocturnal house and display is enormous and just terrific. Get there by 8 and spend as much time as you can!",4.8

What are the chances, the owner is in the back and hears me... The nicest man comes out and says were you after some coffee and I kept saying its okay you are closed now and he said no no I'll do it for you guys, you came all this way! What a special moment.

The Free Mala Tour - 1 1/2 hours - is also very informative showing and explaining things that ordinarily you would just walk past.

We enjoyed the talks we went to and thoroughly was mesmerized by the afternoon bird show. That bird show is a must-see. The park is seamlessly integrated into the foot of the ranges, beautifully maintained with an abundance of birds, lizards, snakes and mammals to gaze at. The park also goes a long way to help you understand the terrain and weather patterns across the central outback and positively promotes traditional and contemporary land management strategies. We would visit again.",4.4

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is an excellent attraction; our big mistake was leaving our visit till mid-afternoon. We did get to join a tour of the Nocturnal House (arriving maybe 10 mins after it started) and also got to see the Bird Show. Both were excellent, with the bird show being particularly entertaining. In the Nocturnal House we saw many Australian desert animals native including malas, stick rats, bilbies and golden bandicoots, as well as other mammals and reptiles. Performers in the bird show included a magpie, a barn owl, a curlew, a whistling kite, a kestrel and a buzzard. Probably the parts of the park I enjoyed most though were some of the walk-in aviaries for small birds, where there many beautiful birds of the Australian desert lands went about their daily tasks, clearly used to their human visitors. I could have easily stayed on for a few more hours.",4.2

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is an amazing place and a must visit for everyone. Ayres Rock is enormous and very spiritual. I would suggest you need no more than 3 days in Uluru and the best place to stay is in Yulara. We stayed at “Sails in the desert” and it was great there. We also hired a car as soon as we landed at Uluru airport. I highly recommend doing this. We had that freedom of coming and going back and forth to the rock and other places whenever we wanted. If you don’t want to hire a car there is a hop on hop off bus service but that would mean waiting for the bus to arrive in the desert heat. Hiring a car was also great as we drove to the Olga’s which was about 45kms from Ayres Rock and also great to see. If you are planning on hiring a car, book in advance. Don’t think you can just arrive at the airport and book last minute. Entry in to the National Park was $25pp for a 3 day pass and that’s all we needed. You can come and go as many times as you please. A must do while in Uluru is watch the sunset and sunrise at Ayres Rock. (There are special sunset/sunrise viewing areas of the rock). It is very hot there out in the desert so make sure you are prepared with hats, sunnies, sunscreen etc. It was a magical 3 days we spent there and I recommend this place to anyone wanting to experience the spiritual heart of Australia.",4.8
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"-As you are on this webpage, you will need to look at other topics on Trip Advisor to get more precise information for a visit to Uluru/Kata Tjuta National Park (because Uluru covers a multitude of sites/activities). However, having just returned from 5 days there, here is a collection of hopefully helpful pieces of information for those going there. -as at least most Australians know, during our lifetimes the name of the area has been changed from Ayres Rock to Uluru. Notwithstanding this, the resort there is called Ayres Rock Resort. -you need to pay ($25) for a pass into the Uluru national park. Its easiest to buy this online at the Parks Australia website .The national park has manned entrances and you will be asked to show your park pass, even if you are on a commercial bus tour. Its easiest to download it to your phone.The money clearly goes to good use. Apart from maintaining the park, guides need to be be accredited before they can take you on a tour. This is good for everyone, because it means you have a very knowledgeable guide. -while you are at the Australian government website for Uluru National Park, suggest you also download maps of it and Kata Tjuta which will be very useful when you visit them. The maps also mark areas you are asked by the local people not to photograph. Ironically, because their sensitivity to this cannot be disclosed to outsiders, the Catch 22 is not even government accredited guides can explain the reasons. (photo of a sign attached). - when you get to the Ayres Rock Resort which is the hub for the many forms of accomodation for viewing Uluru- from 5 star hotels to camping grounds- you will be given a booklet called ""Manta"" (meaning welcome in a local language). Only while writing this report I discovered this informative booklet is available online- it is most useful for you in the planning stage so google ""Manta- Insider's guide to Uluru"" to get a copy to download. Almost as useful as Trip Advisor (actually will give you many topics to search on it). -Uluru National park can be explored in several ways offered by many tour companies eg walk, segway, motorbike, air (plane & helicopter). If you get a window seat, you may even get a great panorama of the area as your commercial plane comes in to land! Also some of friends felt the highlight was taking a parachute jump over the site!. -the 2 major bus tour companies for seeing the sites in the Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park are SEIT and AAT. I preferred the former because they use 11 seater Mercedes minivans. AAT uses full size buses, which obviously cannot go off road like the SEIT vehicles eg to Mt Conner. However, AAT seems to have a monopoly on visiting the much hyped ""Fields of Light""/""Sounds of Silence""-in my opinion, overhyped & overpriced and thus missable. If you only have one night free, far more informative and amazing is to see the stars of the great southern sky above Australia as you have probably never seen them - because the air out here is pure with no city lights or pollution. (Look for ""Astro Tours"" at resort) -in addition to using Trip Advisor and Manta for your forward planning, also suggest on your first day at resort visit Tourist Information Centre in its central town square. Most tour operators have a booth there. -in terms of planning, I highly recommend you plan to spend at least 3 full days on the ground at Ayres Rock Resort (and days on either end to come/go). {You will be very isolated if you stay @ Longitude 131 ( although it has all inclusive prices (ie includes tours) but it is OTT expensive, Have friends who have stayed at both, but based on their prior comments choose to stay in the resort. The resort is far larger and you will meet a great cross section of people plus be at the hub for tours. Also, you can use all the facilities of all the resort hotels but charge everything back to your room . - At least 3 days will allow you to spend a full day exploring each of what are essentially 3 very different but huge rock formations. The 2 famous one are Uluru and Kata Tjuta (which are also listed as UNESCO World Heritage Natural wonders). On the third day, head for the little known Mt Conner - a ""mesa"" rather than a ""monolith"" like the others. Only SEIT has tours there. Alternatively, you can view it from Mt Conner Station which is worth a visit in itself because it is a working1 one million acre cattle station. - a recently started attraction -(at the Camel Farm ,about a 5min drive from the resort)- is called Red Desert Reptiles. Highly recommended. -Uluru is serviced by a broad range of hospitality types, from high end hotels (Longitude 131 and Sails) to backpacker accomodation and camping grounds. Note that Longitude 131 is in an area by itself and is what Americans would call a gated community. Its great advantage is direct views of Uluru, but as usual you pay for location. All the other hotels and hospitality options are in an area called Ayres Rock Resort. All the tourists and hospitality workers form a pleasant small town (called Yulara)- which is listed as the 4th biggest town in the Northern Territory! -Note that Uluru is visible from various sites in the resort and several lookouts within a few minute walk of it., but not hotel rooms (except at Desert Gardens & Longitude 131). -If you do only one guided tour- and the guides all have to accredited by the local people and the government, do the SEIT sunrise base walk of Uluru. Otherwise it and AAT have bus tours around Uluru. What you learn on such tours in terms of the spirituality and mythology of the local people + the geology and ecology of the whole national park will be useful where ever else you go in the vast national park. -all the hotels comprising the Ayres Rock Resort are operated by the highly regarded international Accor group. One of its attractions I have learnt after staying with them for over 20 years all over the world is that apart from being leaders in the hospitality field, they classify their hotels so you know what you are getting eg in size of room/public areas/service etc. Unfortunately, at Uluru the hotels are not branded in their names in the usual Accor way. However, applying the Accor branding system of names to the hotels comprising Ayres Rock Resort, you would get the following results: Sails = Pullman Desert Gardens = Novotel The Lost Camel = Mercure Outback Pioneer = Ibis The resort is also marketed by its indigenous owners under the brand ""Voyages"" Ayres Rock Resort and you are most likely to end up at its booking site or call centre. Based on my experience with them and Accor, as a friendly call centre person from Accor told me , Accor (unlike in my experience with ""Voyages"") uses ""dynamic pricing"". The magic words are to ask/search for the Accor ""prepaid rate"". This saved me over $100pn compared to the price Voyages quoted for the same hotel/dates/room type. Voyages refused to even attempt to match the Accor prepaid rate- but obviously you have to prepay. Although I am not member, I also understand if you join Accor's loyalty program, you can get another 10% off its rates. -although the resort covers a large area, there is a shuttle bus around it. Highly recommended is spending one evening at the Outback Pioneer where there is usually a large BBQ and the fun company of backpackers from all over the world. -Although not publicised - for obvious reasons?- staying at the resort allows you to participate in many free activities for guests (which third party tour operators charge for similar); including (@ Wintjiri Museum (near resort town centre) displays and talks about history ecology of area and its connections to the spirituality and mythology of the local people; tours explaining bush tucker and medicine; astronomy talks including viewing the sun!! and amazing views of the southern sky free of city lights/pollution and you can also even learn to play a didgeridoo (to the point of creating a noise!!)- see attached photo of our enthusiastic instructor. -Note that if you bring only one pair of boots/walking shoes, make sure they have gripping soles because only the area around Uluru is sand. Even Australia's famous RM Williams stockman boots (which I had) are useless on the gravel around Kata Tjuta because their smooth soles do not grip (so you will be slip/sliding as you walk). Also don't make the mistake of being at any of the sites between 11am-3pm; the heat will be 35C+ and probably actually be greater because of the built up radiant heat from the ground and cliff like walls of Uluru/Kata Tjuta (although unlike Asia in such temperatures, there is no humidity). 2 INSIDER TIPS; 1.Some reviewers complain about the flies/wear mesh nets over their heads (which obviously give you a strange view of scenery about you). Far better than usual Australian fly repellents, go to the newsagent in the resort town centre and get a cream called ""Desert Dwellers""- it is what the locals use and will save you giving the ""Australian Salute"" all the time (=waiving your arms to swat away flies).2. Contrary to some statements elsewhere, at least in the case of Avis, it cost the same to rent a car at Ayres Rock airport as in town. It is difficult to get lost from the resort as there is only one highway by it- one direction goes to Mt Conner/Curtin Springs Station and the other to Kata Tjuta/Uluru. TO CONFIRM THE OBVIOUS-ULURU CLIMB IS CLOSED; the Uluru climb is now definitely shut as requested by the indigenous people. The climb area at its start (see attached photo) now (almost) resembles a scene from North Korea. A ranger told me they definitely have it under CCTV surveillance in case a yobbo tries to climb it. ENGLISH vs INDIGENOUS NAMES. Trip Advisor has entries under Ayres Rock and The Olgas for the main attractions in the National Park. For decades these have been officially called by their indigenous names of Uluru and Kata Tjuta; so bear that in mind when doing your searches, because there is a lot of overlap because of the same places being described by either their English or indigenous names. More importantly, they are all unique and fantastic places to visit.",4.1
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> In my opinion, for many walking over the Rock is a symbolic way of saying 'fuck you' to the concept of recognising Aboriginal custodianship... of anything. This is my beef with the ""but why should we care about their religion?"" argument. It's less about religion and more about showing respect in general. When you ignore requests not to climb Uluru, you're not just flipping off ""beliefs"", you're flipping off a specific group of people sociopolitically.",2.3
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> What exactly do you think happened to the Aborigines when the English arrived? They all disappeared in a big poof of dust? That has absolutely nothing to do with Uluru. Your argument is analogous to somebody saying that we have to honour ""Bob's Burgers"" in Asslick Tennessee as a culturally sacred site because otherwise all those brave people in the World Trade Centre would have died for nothing. Australian aboriginals have never been a single, homogeneous group of people, and the experiences of those on the east coast at the hands of the English are not the same as those in the centre. Nor is Uluru sacred to the Aboriginal tribes of other parts of Australia, except in the modern, post-European colonial sense that Ayer's Rock is a symbol of Australia, a beautiful and awe-inspiring part of the natural landscape for **all** Australians to celebrate. We, collectively, have committed many sins against the Aboriginal people of Australia, and continue to do so. But we don't owe their religious superstitions any more respect than we owe respect to other ancient fairy tales about Zeus or Odin, and allowing one tiny group of Australians, whose membership is 100% based on genetic ancestry, privileges over the rest of us is just racism.",2.3

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"So first up, it's literally the middle of nowhere, I think the next town of any note is Coober pedy and that's about a 4 hour drive, in another state, north I think Darwin is the next real community of note, and that's probably 10 hours drive. Next is the cost of everything, buy something in Adelaide for $3.00 it's $5.00 in Alice springs due to transport issues. So basically will probably be 50% more expensive then elsewhere. Then finally, the locals, street view the city centre, those bars and reinforced windows exists for a reason! That reason is a small population of the locals, which ruin it for the majority. It has one of the highest rates per capita of car thefts, burglary, well, just crime in general, in Australia. Now it may be a great career opportunity, but with those 3 major points raised, I'm not sure it's good for raising a family.

It has always been hampered by the fact that groups living in Alice Springs report/ don't report certain types of crime at staggeringly different rates. The ""higher crime rates are bad because crime is bad"" vs ""higher crime rates are good because it's actually just an increase in reporting rates which is what we need to solve the underlying issue"" is a debate that has been going back and forth in this area (and others) for decades. I don't know what the answer is. I strongly suspect there actually is none.

What's crazy is that if you look at it on a map, you'll see that it's right in the goddam middle of Australia. The area is mostly Aboriginal sovereign land and usually permits are required to visit. If you're unfamiliar with Australia, know that there's a reason very few people live in the central areas of the continent- it is hot, dry, and harsh. Much like the natives of the Americas, the Aboriginal peoples of Australia have been treated horribly. Areas like Ayers Rock (Uluru) see more tourism than most other natural parks in Australia, but the local tribes are still very poor. To this day, there are ongoing slavery lawsuits between Aboriginal people and the Australian government.

You can start this from the car park beside the ramp where boat tours leave from. It's over a kilometre walking up the ridge (some places are very steep, and some steps are the sandstone rocks, no way anyone with mobility issues could do this). At the top you can continue on more trails, unfortunately all we had time for was a few photos. But now have ticked off a great Australian icon",3.7
Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I’m not the person you asked, but I visited Urulu back in 2002. I was a student at the time. I went on a three day camping trip around that area. We left from Alice Springs in a mini bus. The first evening we watched the sun set over the rock. I have a series of photos taken about 10 minutes apart, it’s fascinating how the rock changes colour as the sun goes down. We slept in swags under the stars, which everyone should do at least once in their lives, and just before dawn the next morning we went on a walking tour around the base of Uluru. It probably took a couple of hours. There were a few places that are considered very sacred and you’re not allowed to film/take photos. The thing that surprised me was the shape. Everyone’s seen that classic photo where it kind of looks like a loaf of bread, but close up it’s a lot more irregular. There are caves and pools of water. Some of the caves have Aboriginal art in them, which might be 100s of years old. We also visited Kata Jtata (the Olgas) which is quite close, and on the third day on the way back to Alice Springs we went to Kings Canyon (like the Grand Canyon but smaller) It’s probably changed a bit since then. Sorry if I rambled on a bit, but it was nice to share some happy memories. I hope you get a chance to go there one day.",3.5

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,- The airport at Yulara (Ayres Rock Resort) was upgraded and with the advent of low-cost carriers people could feasibly fly to Yulara to visit Uluṟu over an extended weekend rather than drive for days with nothing to see. - The cost of fuel has also made the cheap Jetstar flight more attractive than a road trip. - Alice Springs is feral. Apparently it’s gotten even worse since I was up that way a few years ago. - Not entirely related to Alice Springs itself but 60% of visitors to Uluṟu pre-2019 were Japanese. The Japanese visited purely to climb it so when the climb closed that market dried up. It was also the reason so much notice was given (18 months IIRC).

At the bottom there is a shaded grassy area perfect for a picnic or relaxing on a hot day. Be prepared, the path up to the top rises some 80 metres or so and on a hot day it can be exhausting.

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"We stayed overnight at Ormiston Gorge recently in early March and found we were the only campers which made our stay even more special. Camp fees were reasonable ($10 per person per night) and the amenities were very adequate with toilets and hot showers. Camp area is well set out with individual sites marked our and numbered and there were gas BBQs available (didn’t use them though). The sites are quite close together and fairly rocky but we were just happy to set up our tent and enjoy the quietness of being alone there. There is a separate camp area for large groups. I can’t recall now but I think that there were about 18-20 sites and it is a first come basis with no bookings taken. The whole area of Ormiston Gorge and Pound is very well set up for day visitors as well as the campers and there were works/repairs being carried out on the path to the swimming hole while we were there after heavy rains in Dec/Jan. A good kiosk is there as well for refreshments. We walked the Pound loop and absolutely loved the experience. It did take us the suggested 4 hours as at that time we had to swim and/or wade in three places towards the end of the walk due to the recent rains. We had met the lovely young Park ranger who said that the water was slowly getting cooler but we found it very pleasant. At that time of the year and after walking for a few hours it was a very welcome swim and only added to the whole experience. We had no issues doing the walk at that time of the year, leaving just before sunrise so we were back before the heat of the day. The scenery throughout the walk was fantastic and varied with some boulder sections but overall not too difficult (we are mid 50s and average fitness and had no trouble at all). There were no other visitors in the park that day so we really enjoyed the solitude of the walk. It was just beautiful and peaceful. The short walk up to Ghost Gum lookout is a must as well for a fantastic view of the Gorge. It is impossible not to take too many photos of this place - definitely worth the visit and overnight stay !!",4.1

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had rented a Camper Van. By Day 3, we knew a powered site was needed. Campervans require sealed roads, and our next location was the Ayer’s Rock Resort at Yulura. This is a 5.5 hour drive from Ormiston Gorge , unless you have 4WD capability, and even that requires the Merinee Pass to be opened. Refuelling in Alice Springs, we made a brief stop at the Art Gallery, before driving to Ayers’ Rock Resort (ARR) in time for Sunset. The sheer size of the rock is very impressive, and truly changes colour as the sun sets. ARR was our home for two nights and the powered site made a huge difference to our comfort. The facilities are first class, with Showers, laundry, bin bay and swimming pool. A shuttle bus service connects the campground to the three hotels in the complex, as to the Shopping village. Day 4 was taking on the Rock Base walk, which meant a 12.5 km hike around Uluru itself. If you show up at 10 AM, a local ranger will give a guided tour for the first 1.5 km or so, which is well worth it. The hike path is completely flat, but even so, you need to pack water for the journey. The rock does take on various ‘faces’ as you circumnavigate it, and once back in the carpark, it is wise to visit the Cultural Centre and café to rest the feet. Around 5 PM, cars and tour buses gather at two viewing sites within the Uluru National Park itself, which gives you a much closer sunset experience with the rock.",3.9

But I will ask that you do more research on not only Uluru, but also the Aboriginal people as a whole, the atrocities committed against them, and how they are today trying to regain the culture and spirituality that was taken from them. I think you will find it goes far beyond the modern demands of “don’t climb muh rock”",3.3

We joined the groups at the dingoes, kangaroos, plants and birds. All were wonderful experiences. The display with the birds flying around us and down to the ground for food was amazing. We also loved seeing lots of other birds in the various large aviaries and learning to identify them. The nocturnal house showed us creatures that we would never have seen otherwise.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the Desert Park after a ten day-trip down the Stuart Highway and into the West MacDonnell Ranges, and still it was an excellent visit. The botanic garden is not that interesting after seeing the landscape on our trip, but there are a few things that make the (not quite cheap) visit worthwhile: - the nocturnal house: vast exhibition, many animals that you would only hear in the night in the Outback and have a chance to see there, also some animals that do not survive in the wild any more due to introduced predators such as cats they are not prepared for. - the bird of prey show: Great! Living in Europe, we have seen many of these shows here, but never anything like that. It was a true choreography of birds flying on and off and right over our heads, and it was funny and interesting. - the staff: The staff was incredibly friendly and made sure everybody was aware of the different shows and talks that held place, and they also walked around the park and stopped by for a few minutes just to explain to you what you were looking at. That way, we learned a great deal more about the animals then we would have just reading the signs. Note: Bring enough water. There are drinking fountains in the park but much of it is in plain sunlight (not the bird show, though).",3.9

How had a long established name, Uluru. The name 'Ayers Rock' is a symbol of a more racist colonial time that has passed.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was truly excited to have an opportunity to see native animals in their natural habitat rather than in cages like at a typical zoo. The first exhibit we saw was the dingoes that were being walked around the park; having a chance to see them up close was truly special and a wonderful experience. Our next stop was the nocturnal house which was probably worth the price of admission by itself. Inside were a range of native animals that are nocturnal in nature (snakes, spiders, lizards, rats, frogs etc). This area was well prepared and the information was outstanding. Best of all it was air conditioned and a chance to step out of the heat for a while. I next wandered around the rest of the park and truth be told was a little disappointed. The kangaroo area had five kangaroos, the emu area had two emus, the aquarium was much smaller than what I had expected and the bird enclosures seemed to be a bit of an afterthought and probably needed some work. The visit was concluded with a bird show run by the park. This was amazing. A variety of birds of prey and a sneaky magpie were shown to the crowd. Whilst each bird was flying around, one of the handlers provided a commentary about the bird including what it eats, where it hunts, how it hunts and other interesting facts. Seeing a wedgetail eagle (with its 2m wingspan) up close was phenomenal. All in all, glad I visited but I probably wouldn't go again.",3.2

Arriving in Alice at midday with two kids in tow (5 and 8 years old) we checked in and decided to educate ourselves on the environment we're spending the next two weeks in. While we arrived in the early afternoon there were still plenty of activities going on. Aside from the displays of the various ecosystems including flora and fauna of we also heard the Incredible Edibles talk (bush tucker and bush medicine) and saw the free flight bird show. The kids enjoyed both, tasting a bush raisin and aweing at the birds (including owls and raptors). The cinema presentation also provided a good history of the region from the very beginning of time to now. Both kids enjoyed the park and we spent just under 4 hours here. One of the highlights for the kids was seeing a real wild snake along the paths, but also the reptile exhibits introducing us all to the Thorny Devil for the first time too. It was a great introduction for us to the area and has got us even more excited about the adventures ahead.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our outback journey from Adelaide to Darwin wouldn't have been complete without a trip to the magnificent rock Uluru. For those who may not know, Uluru is situated about 450km from Alice Springs. The park itself was handed back to the aboriginal people who then agreed to lease it to the national parks for the next 99 years. The park then charges $25 for a 3 day pass. While I'm sure the $25 per person (not vehicle) goes towards the upkeep of the park, the rock has managed around 600 million years by itself. The fact the pass spans over 3 days I'm sure makes it excellent value to a lot of travellers and visitors who can then watch both the sunset and sunrise, but due to our time constraints we could only watch as the sun disappeared behind the horizon. So $50 for a couple of hours was fairly expensive. But disregarding the money aspect, to watch the sunset and the rock changing colours should most certainly be on anyones list. We arrived a few hours early and got an excellent spot, but it did get busy as the evening drew on. There is a road that loops around the rock which is worth the drive to get a closer inspection along with several other walks. Please note that the park closes 45 minutes after the sunsets so make sure you have done most of the activities and drives before watching the sun go down.",3.5

I did a sunrise tour around the rock but the highlight was riding a bike around the base. Exercise clothes and sneakers (no need for hiking clothes) were perfect to explore don't forget your hat and sunglasses.",4.2

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom was, simply put, the highlight of our Kakadu trip. After the 4WD trek in, we were rewarded with the most spectacular experience. The climb up to the top of the falls is hard and I would advise anyone going up to wear sturdy footwear, for the track is very rough in places. However, once up, you can soothe those feet in crystal clear, cool water while surveying the landscape around you. It is an experience like no other, especially with the natural infinity pool effect. In order to get the best experience (and photos), go up an hour before sunset. That way, the groups have all left and the water is ever so still. You'll have the pools to yourself and some remarkable colours to look at.",4.4

Missed last bird of prey show by 2minutes with a distraught daughter we were only offered a discounted return the next day to see it.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"By the end very few people were climbing anyway, and the rate was declining. It was endangering highly localised species. The rubbish, piss, and shit left behind by visitors was fouling up the fragile ecosystems on the rock as well as the surrounding water systems. Anangu found all this disrespectful, which is fair enough. People don't want Anzac memorials or fragile areas of national parks treated this way. The relationship Anangu have with sites around Uluru goes beyond this, however. It doesn't neatly translate or have a direct equivalent, because it is an integral part of a radically different cosmology/ontology/relationality (keep in mind that the last uncontacted group, the 'Pintupi Nine', were only brought in in 1984). I'm happy to go into this further/provide resources if anyone is interested. So there's the declining commercial significance of climbing Uluru, environmental concerns, and the very genuine cultural connection to land (cultural meaning linguistic, cosmological, ontological etc.), the depth and dimensions of which are not immediately apparent. Almost forgot that on top of all that, there are the safety concerns. >Thirty seven people have died climbing Uluru since 1950, the last as recently as July 2018.

Australia is HUGE and a place like Kakadu is VERY unique with its own seasons, animals, landscape and resultant way of life. A way of life completely different to how the people in say the Darling / Barwon river area or the people on the south east QLD coast would have lived. Also not to mention people in Kakadu would not intermingle with people on the east or west coast unless they happened to permanently migrate there. It's too far to walk just to have a corroboree.",3.3

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,">What are the stepping stones for change in your opinion? >And having self determination is key. Plenty of orgs in Alice are blending culture and practical mental health practices - focussing on wellbeing and building up the Individual. There is a place for this and this is where change is happening. Aborigine culture is a failed culture that is incompatible with the modern world. It will need to be updated and focused on materialism rather than family bonds and mysticism. Either that or we have to accept that they will never bridge the gap with a modern, western , capitalist society. That’s ok too. But at least be realistic and appropriate when we look at outcome gaps in health or education or life span. >The tired narrative of everyone focussing on being a victim really is dismissive of the context as to why we are where we’re at. It’s not being a victim to highlight why Aboriginal outcomes such as health, social and economical are so low compared to other Australians. Atrocities that occurred are a part of this. And they’re from not hundreds of years ago. The stolen general/white Australia policy are both from the 20th Century. Victim /grievance politics is not productive and just leads to divisions and conflict. If you have a western background our ancestors were mired in that kind of thinking for generations and it took world wars before we settled our differences and decided cooperation and mutual benefit were superior options rather than fighting over historical injustices perceived or otherwise. We can acknowledge what happened in the past but it shouldn’t be our main focus or the starting point we negotiate for the future, e.g reparations or “stolen generation “ narratives, aborigine focused welfare etc Aborigines need to be seen as equal partners and in turn judged with the same metrics the rest of Australia are. The same expectations. >Simply. There is a reason for the state of Alice Springs and the branches of this true are numerous and each have their own twigs and leaves. There’s no need to over complicate it and lose sight of the outcomes that are needed. Too many academic types in dreamworld and not enough people who get shit done is part of the problem. >The solution is self destination and action. Organisations like Kings Narrative in Alice Springs are making immense change in the background through funding from cooperate Australia, leaving behind politics. Insighting real change and action. Though this progress will not be shown on national television. These organisations have failed . They should be held to account, ditto all their left wing elite enablers . >And just quickly, “Aborigines”? Mate it’s 2024… I’ll use whatever term I want mate",2.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We stayed nearby, so saw Uluru from a distance at first. Then got up to see sunrise from one of the viewing points, but it was cloudy. Luckily, we were here for a couple of nights, so got to see sunrise and sunset again - the way the light changes the colour of the rock is amazing. I also did a helicopter flight - it's a great way to see Uluru and surrounding landscape. If you can afford it, I'd definitely recommend it. We also did the base walk around the rock itself - it's a flat and well marked path around the rock itself - it took us about 2.5 hours for the full 10km. There are certain areas where you can't take photographs so just use your eyes and take in the amazing formations - it's no wonder the rock is sacred to the indigenous people.",3.9
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When you first see Uluru, you’ll be blown away. It’s stunning and appears to change colour depending on the time of day. Visit at both sunrise and sunset. A few things to remember - bring a fly net for your face. You may think it looks stupid but everyone wears them and you won’t regret it! It also gets really really hot by mid-morning so if you’re doing the base walk, start early. And bring at least 2L of water. It’s 10.6km and took us about 2.5hrs.",4.2
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Mum and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Alice Springs Desert Park. I agree with other reviews that you need to allow plenty of time to really enjoy this Park at a leisurely pace. We were interested more in the flora of each of the desert environments and we just loved the walk in averies that were around to see the beautiful birds. I particularly wanted to see the Sturts Desert Pea which was out in flower and just beautiful! The nocturnal house was not for us unfortunately as mum (83 years) was quite frightened as her eyes didn't seem to adjust to the darkness as well as mine did. We had a quick look but for her it was quite dangerous. We had morning tea and lunch at the cafe which we enjoyed very much. Highly recommend this place when visiting Alice Springs.,4.2

Use of the official title respects both the traditional inhabitants of the land and new history of Australia. You should definitely acknowledge and respect the Pitjantjatjara (firstly by calling them by name instead of lumping all aboriginal people together when they are a vast collection of wildly different cultures and beliefs) but that doesn't mean you need to erase 100 years of recent history in the area. Remember that up until 2002 Ayers Rock was the primary way that Uluru was referred to. And even after that it took a long time for everyone to adjust.",3.7

We were treated to a talk on Lara the Barn Owl. It was very informative and interesting. Thanks Angus! And thanks also to Greg, another ranger, who explained all about the bush coconut.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Central Australia has a number of tiny little settlements of Indigenous communities. These communities have undergone a fair amount of generational trauma with the breakdown of traditional tribal structures as previously migratory groups settled in a single place and successive governments have alternately tried to destroy, assimilate, coddle and punish these groups over the last hundred years. They remain aware of but separate from the standard Trainspotting monologue that guides mainstream society. Most of these communities also have mobile phone coverage so people can see exactly what they don’t have but, being a small population in a small country, there is next to no online representation of their situation. The worst damage has been the introduction of alcohol and recreational drugs which people have wholeheartedly latched onto as an escape from monotony and misery. With birth rates rising and infant mortality falling, there’s been an expansion of the younger demographics but, because many of the older community members are wasting away on alcohol, these youths lack leadership and role models so they form gangs to, essentially, entertain each other. Bad ideas enter these groups, rattle around and escalate in the way that teens try to outdo each other. For occasional big events - such as the local Show (county fair) or a visiting national football game - these groups come to Alice Springs which at 20,000 people is the biggest city within a thousand kilometres. The groups often have beef - real, imagined or even based on tribal history- and use these opportunities to settle scores. All the good things in Alice Springs costs money which these groups do not have, so they steal, often with an accompanying threat of violence because, well, that’s what works. The one thing that is free is adrenaline so there’s also a lot of risk-taking like stealing cars and being chased by the police, which often ends in a fatal crash. On the up-side, they don’t use guns but knives are becoming more prominent. Things like hammers are regular weapons but spears come out when shit really gets real and they are planning on someone dying. If you’ve ever been near a guy with a spear who’s pissed off at you, it is not a good experience. Edited to add paragraphs because of complaints",2.5

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,I second this. What people need to understand is that alcohol is a symptom of the problem not the cause - despite many high profile people declaring otherwise. The real issue is that over the last 15 years the federal and territory governments have reduced funding for services and programs in Alice Springs and communities to the point where there is no support. They blame alcohol because it’s an easy sell. But the reality is people drink to escape their suffering and if their life wasn’t so shit they wouldn’t drink.,2.6

Also the indigenous exhibit near the rock is great too. The resort is expensive- I stayed in a cabin in the caravan park with a couple of friends. It was relatively inexpensive and had everything we needed including a little kitchen. I don’t know about now, but one thing that surprised me was that the prices in the little supermarket for food were not outrageous at the time- just a bit more than Sydney prices.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There were three of us with all different reasons to visit a Big Red Rock. Obviously everyone has to go? then perhaps you should ask the question why? Is this a tick list because everybody goes & you should go its iconic , or because it is as geological phenomena or spiritual association. To explore the rock you need to get close and then it is very impressive with it looming up as you approach it. The various trails are well established around the rock, although the downside is the amount of people, bikes, segways all sharing the same route, so to try & find a quiet spot just to take everything in, well . . . good luck. There are information boards around telling the various stories of the Aboriginals, you will need a good imagination at times, but no information about the rock itself, how it was formed, its geology, etc. The best & most informative bit of the rock was the free ranger led morning walk, which we realised should be taken before wandering off & exploring the rock on your own. It is also disappointing that you can't get to all parts of the rock or take photos of the most interesting parts.",3.2

Try to do the short walk about an hour before sunset, The colours of the rock faces are spectacular. The camping ground is worth staying at. There is no grass for tents but if you get there early enough, you will find a good spot. One tip: If you are erecting a tent, bring a hammer, good strong tent-pegs & a hammer drill with at least an 8-12"" concrete drill bit to get through the rocks underneath the surface. I ended up wrecking 3 pegs. The camp has free gas bbq's, toilets, showers & troughs to hand-wash your clothes. There are no clotheslines, so bring a rope & pegs.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Mum and I came here last year and are both so glad that we did. Uluru is something that every Australian MUST see at least once in their lifetime. We did the 10 kilometre base walk around Uluru. If you are planning on doing the base walk, it is important that you go either early morning at sunrise or sunset, it is not safe to do it in the middle of the day as it gets extremely hot and there is no shade. Also make sure you pack plenty of water and Gatorade as well as wear appropriate clothing (information on appropriate clothing in “Tips”) to avoid dehydration, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. When we arrived at Uluru, I was at a loss for words, the rock is huge and just feels so magical. They say the rock changes colour throughout the day and I can confirm that is 100% true, I could see Uluru as we entered the park by the bus and it looked purple but by the time we actually arrived at the rock it was bright orange. Uluru There are certain parts of Uluru that you cannot photograph, these places are clearly marked with signs asking that you not take photographs, this is around the north - east face of Uluru. The reason for this is that the rock details and features at these sites are equivalent to sacred scripture for the Anangu - they describe culturally important information that should only be viewed in their original location and by specific people. Throughout the walk, there are emergency phones and seats with wooden shelters over them should you become ill or injured and require help.

It is indigenous seeking help from the law. Young people in poverty and addiction are violent. Alice Springs is also not the NT. I live here. I love it. The indigenous population are not defacto pro crime. They want help from being victims of it.

The station, originally built under classified U.S. Air Force oversight, features deep underground infrastructure, including a 10,000-foot borehole, raising suspicions about its true purpose. No official archaeological surveys were conducted during its construction, and by 1984, the site was officially protected, preventing further excavation. Given the timing, secrecy, and underground expansions, the theory suggests that JGGRS may have been built over an immovable UFO, hiding it in plain sight. --- Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1j7xndd/the_giant_ufo_can_be_buried_beneath_jggrs_a/mh0i3lb/",2.9

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This has to go on every Aussies bucket list. It is an Aussie icon and absolutely worth a visit. It is a spectacular sight to see both at sunset and sunrise. There are vantage points set up around the rock to get great views. You can do a lot around here, walk, ride a bicycle, Segway or drive around the base. We were lucky enough to climb. The rock is closed a lot of the time for climbing, if it’s too windy, too hot, chance of rain or an aboriginal significant event. The climb was a great achievement for us and we really wanted to do it before it closes in Oct 2019. We are so glad we got to. It is an amazing sight as you drive into Yulara, a huge majestic rock pops up out of nowhere. It is just as amazing from the top of the rock. I haven’t done it, but would be fantastic to see from a plane or helicopter. A great place to visit.",4.8

Walking around it, your mind cannot comprehend the scope of it, the fact it's there, flat earth all around with nothing else visible, it's magical. We started to head back, and it rained just a little bit, a few random drops and I laughed, hey dad, guess you got that rain you wanted. After a while that picked up into a shower, then eventually a storm, and then sheer torrential rain. It's genuinely awe inspiring. My dad had lived in Alice Springs for 5 years and had always hoped to see it, to be there when it happened was magic. I to this day believe my dad might still be a wizard.",4.8

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited a couple of times over 2 days and I found it best at sunset - the sunset viewing areas are well situated to catch the late afternoon light and the colours shift as the sun sets. The morning viewing platform is more to the south of the rock so the morning light only catches the end of the rock in Winter when we were there - given the huge numbers there at that time (and big crowds trying to get a photo from the viewing platform) I'd not bother with that again. Having said that, Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) really popped in the dawn light, even when seen from Uluru which is over 50 km away - much more impressive than Uluru itself. There is a ring road around the rock which is worth a drive and the Mutitjulu Waterhole was definitely worth a visit. There are some culturally sensitive areas around the base of the rock that the traditional owners ask not to be photographed and they are REALLY, REALLY not keen on people climbing the rock, and not just for safety reasons. A reasonable view of Uluru can also be had from the Yulara resort ( from a sand dune mound in the centre of the circular main road), but that is about 20 km away and outside the park boundary.",3.3

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We paddled to the end of gorge 5 in a double canoe and it was worth every cent. A long day of 9 hours but not too strenuous and the gorge was cool and shady compared to the escarpment country above (we had done a 12km walk to three lookouts the previous day and it felt a lot longer in the heat). Each gorge is a different landscape with 5 being the most spectacular for us - narrow and high. A few birds and a couple of freshwater crocs were good to see, but the gorge is the star. Lots of shady lunch spots even at midday at this time of year. Beyond gorge 3 we saw only a few canoes for the whole day. The walk into butterfly gorge and lily ponds are well worth it and accessible even for half day trips (way cooler than walking in, as we found!). Some reviewers and some of the half-day canoeists on our trip have noted that the portages can be tricky and hard work. We are both around 60 and really enjoyed the challenge (as well as cooling off in the rapids). The water level in late June meant that there was flow over the rapids, but not dangerous or deep. The quickest way is through the rapids rather than over the rocks because it's generally shorter. However, we are experienced in whitewater paddling and that helps with confidence in scrambling over wet and sometimes slippery rocks. We did not have a bow rope which they give to overnight campers. Very helpful in the portages through rapids. I would ask for one or take my own next time. But if you are up for the challenge, it is hugely worthwhile and a lot of fun. The paddle distances were quite short - maybe a total of only 10-12 km for the day. It is such a different experience to be in the middle gorges and have them completely to yourself.",4.1

We were blessed by having a guide whose origins were aborigine (his Anglised name being something like Alwyn). If you can go on something guided by him then do so and he will explain to you the real significance to the indigenous people of the Rock and its surroundings. He also gave us information about Aborigine customs and beliefs but, at the same time, also gave a pretty good Western scientific explanation as to how the Rock came about.

BUT, check conditions in the gorge itself as you may be required to wade or swim , if there has been rain.

You don't want to kiss the birds show- the people are so amazingly knowledgeable and the birds are just another unique experience. We learnt a lot from the show.

For sunset, head to the designated areas, find a quiet spot, if you can, and watch Uluru change colors. It's a calming, breathtaking experience. We went out at 6:00 p.m. for a 7:30 p.m. sunset. Practically had the place to ourselves until 7:00. In summer, lots of walks close early--I'm assuming due to the heat. So we got up early, did the Mala walk--where you get up close, experience some scared places, and learn about Uluru--then headed back to the the Resort around 11:00. Plenty of time for lunch and a swim before heading back out for sunset.",2.7

Aviaries, and other fauna installations are first rate, and the Nocturnal facility is definitely the best we've been to. We went for 2 hrs, and stayed for 5, and still missed several shows and presentations.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Absolutely, go to the Red Center. We go in their winter when it can be a bit cold, but lacks the flies the outback is famous for. Over the past 25 years I've been there a number of times and it is always spectacular. The first time there was the first climb, back when it was typical to climb at least part way up, when the aboriginals referred to us as ants as we made our little trail up the worn hiking path. Over the years they have at first banned the climb and then relented and now only ask that you respect their wishes and not climb it. While climbing is spectacular, if increasingly dangerous as we age, there are other ways to enjoy the monolith. On one trip we took a plane tour, taking off in a reasonably sized Cessna about 30 minutes before sunset for a tour of Kings Canyon and the two outcrops for which the area is famous. Another visit saw us in a tour circumnavigating the base with small hikes into crevices and along the bottom. All expeditions have been very worthwhile. Tips: apart from the two outcrops, there is not a lot to see and do. While there are decent places to stay for all budgets, plan to be there two days, maybe three, depending on how outdoor worthy you are and the weather conditions at the time of year of your trip. And a quick technical note... this is NOT a ""large rock"" sitting out in the Outback. This is an outcrop, a weathered remnant of a continuous deposition across a much broader area. The formation is continuous across to the Olgas.",3.9

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru isn't a sacred site because it's big. It's a sacred site because it has watering holes (so water and food) plus shelter. Thousands of other rocks fit that description and were routinely visited and decorated by Indigenous Australians, yet only two are offensive to climb. Mt Connor is also big (859 metres above sea level vs 863 for Uluru) and is located nearby. However, without providing water there was no reason for the local Indigenous population to visit, thus is not sacred. Also, without modern geographic methods, there would have been no way for the local Indigenous population to determine if Mt Connor or Uluru was taller. So the idea that Uluru is special because it's the tallest rock isn't accurate.",2.8

I saw that the Alice Wanderer bus can take you to/from the park, but the only pick up time from the hotels was at 830 or 230, and all pick up times from the park was at 430, so I ended up taking a cab both ways. It cost about $20 each way. The gift shop people at the park will call you a cab back to your accommodation if you don't want to make an international call to order a cab (since the park is a bit out of the way from traffic, you can't just go out and hail one on the streets). The park itself takes about 2.5 hours to walk and view if you don't do any of the guided tours. However, I strongly recommend the tours! The tour is actually more of a guided talk, and each tour is about 20 minutes long, and the tour guide shares a lot of knowledge on the animals or nature and you get a much better understanding of the animals or nature you're seeing. My tour guide was kangaroos and dingos was Jerry (or Gerry?). It seemed like he was filling in for someone else who normally does the tour, but I thought Jerry was fantastic! He was really knowledgable and during the kangaroo tour, he shared some extra photos to supplement the tour. Also do NOT miss the bird show that happens at 10 AM. They do NOT allow anyone to go in late because it's a free-flying bird show (the birds fly out in the open). So be sure to get to the bird show location about 10-15 minutes early and grab a seat, as seats will fill up quickly! It rained heavily the morning I showed up at the park, and it seems like the park will give out umbrellas to visitors. I had brought my own. You are out in the open most of the time, so be sure to carry an umbrella if you think it will rain the day you are going to the park. Despite the rain, I still got to enjoy all the animals and desert scenery. And if it the bird show ends up being canceled because of the rain, they will give out a voucher for you to come back another day.",4.2
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"You'll be drawn to the majestic beauty and sheer size of the spectacular Katherine Gorge. Located on the lands of the Jawoyn people, rock art sites dot the park and dreaming stories bring the silent gorge walls to life. You can learn about the Jawoyn people's association with the land at the Nitmiluk Centre or by taking a boat cruise of the first few gorges. Take sunrise or sunset cruises and see the gorge turn all shades of mauve and red. There are canoes for hire or you can get a permit to use your own canoe from the Nitmiluk National Park Visitor Centre.",4.4
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Living in Alice we brought a years pass to Alice Springs Desert Park. Our 2yr old loves it. A lovely peaceful place to spend a couple of hours. I never tire of the bird show as they rotate the birds on display. The nocturnal house is excellent and the walk in bird aviaries are delightful. Best of all for mums there is a sand pit and a coffee shop to end the morning. Best to avoid it in the heat of the day, early mornings are my favorite time.",4.6
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The view of the rock is great. Abit disappointing with sunrise and sunset because the sunset and rises behind the viewing area not behind the rock. Still nice but not what l expected. Turned around and took photos of sunset and sunrise behind me. Its a big rock. We also went on tour to the rock and touched it and did some walking too. Didn't get o climb it on our tour but some people were up climbing it. Would have loved to climb it.,3.2
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We loved walking around the largest rock in the world. Why did I rate it as average: 1. The park system does a very poor job of providing information to travelers. 2. On the walk to circumnavigate the rock, there is only ONE water station. 3. No safety information is provided about the signs of heat stroke, what to do, how to deal with it, or the distance between emergency beacons. 4. There are places along the journey were you are asked not to take pictures. But, they aren't really clear because you could literally stand 1 meter before the sign, point your camera in the direction of the rock, and capture the image. 5. There is not good education provided on cultural sensitivity. 6. The park service still allows people to climb the rock! This is a sacred site, climbing should not be allowed. 7. Cultural explanation signs are all written in the past tense. Do people not use Uluru any longer for ceremony? All this being said, it's still worth the visit.",3.1
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"I have not been to Ormiston Gorge for quite some time and I cannot believe the transformation.

Make sure you do the 3 gorge cruise and the Dawn one is fantastic for the light. Splurge and take the helicopter flight and do the Ultimate 3-4 hours one if you can afford it and stop to have the Swim in your own waterhole and explore the rock art. The view from above is just fantastic. Also do a walk starting with the Baruwei Loop by climbing up to the lookout and taking the loop back across the escarpment. You’ll even get a surprise it you have your phone with you as this was one of the only places we ever got mobile reception. Anyway we loved it here with the stars and bats at night and dawn, crocks, eagles, buffalos and gorgeous gorges.",4.7

GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,Beautiful nature park showcasing Central Australian birds and animals.

All set against the backdrop of the MacDonnell Ranges.,4.5
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Also, Australians love camping, in 2017 the popular app Wikicamps had 50+ free campsites listed in and around the Uluru area, on little bush tracks tucked away, and heaps of desert camping. By 2019 it was all gone from the app, with signs up all along the Lasseter HWY saying to keep away. This pretty much forces you into Yulara, an overpriced town that feels like you're in a Swedish prison.",2.5
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I went to Uluru as part of a group Mulgas adventure tour in late April 2017 – and wow the rock form is amazing. First we went on the circular route around the rock, and being April the weather was lovely and balmy. It’s a nice walk with rest stops/huts along the way if you get too tired, I think some providers even offer cycling on the track. Bear in mind though, like with general travel in the central region, that you need to bring along at least two litres of water with you. There are signs around along the track which show the aspects of the uluru façade which you are not allowed to take images, due to cultural traditions. Also it was mentioned to not take any rock or fragments from the place – Apparently some other international tourists think it’s a good souvenir but not aware that it’s illegal and also that some have experienced ‘a curse effect’ when taking the rocks. So in short, photos only! Along the walk you being to see the many tones of the formation and in some parts of the rock, you can actually walk right next to and touch the rock formation. Its quite amazing. Nearby this area too theres a waterhole and Indigenous rock art – its on the walk way, which is a side trip inwards to the inner part of the rock, a 10 min diversion. The information centre complex is quite informative – Many buildings make up the centre – one with selling art, one with nature information and many more with different aspects of the Uluru area and indigenous culture. Bear in mind that the information centre grounds, photography is prohibited due to cultural aspects – the rangers on site and staff will notice – so don’t try! The information centre had limited handouts and some none at all – due to the volumes of tourists arriving. I found the Uluru app (which you can download) and also the uluru website better than the printed materials available at the centre. Also if you want a souvenir of the uluru rock, I realised afterwards that its cheaper and more variety in the actual Yulara township (the town centre of the uluru resort). The souvenir shop at the uluru information centre sold some gaudy foreign made souvenirs, but the local indigenous art and locally made products is highly recommended to buy here but. On a side note, near the main carpark is the controversial uluru rock climb chain – where some people decide to scale up the Uluru rock. I didn’t go up out of respect for the indigenous people but also because of the danger – you have to scale up by yourself about 1/6th of the way before you reach the metal chain, and the steepness of the rock, means some overly ambitious foreign tourists were crawling back down on all fours. It looked pretty dangerous and if you like a good view, I can recommend getting a window seat on your arrival or departure flight. Usually it’s the left hand side arriving and right hand side of the plane when departing which has the aspect of the rock. Overall the Uluru experience was amazing and can highly recommend making the venture!",4.0

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Are you serious? The distance. Most of us live on the coast. Uluru is in the centre of the continent. To get there by car is like a 2 day drive from almost anywhere where the majority of us live. To fly there is crazy expensive. Alice Springs is also like a war zone of crime.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went on the sunrise base walk run by AAT Kings. I was slightly apprehensive as I'm not very fit, however the tour information issued the day before reassured me that it would be possible to stop part way if preferred. As it happens the walk is on the flat throughout (although 12km in distance) and our visit being in winter meant that temperatures were fine for walking. You do need to take water with you, but we were supplied with a breakfast snack selection before we set off. At around the halfway mark the coach met us again to provide hot drinks, a water top up if required and another snack. It was at this point that you could drop out if you wanted to and go to the cultural centre. The guides, Tom and Stephen, were brilliant: good humoured, knowledgeable and attentive. Obviously in a group of 20 there will be some fast walkers and some much slower, but for the most part the group managed to stay together. Uluru is, of course, magical. Tom shared many of the stories associated with the rock and the beliefs and traditions of the local people. To stand beside the waterhole in the shade of trees, whilst gazing up at the towering walls of Uluru, will be a lasting memory. Feeling a huge sense of achievement we returned to the coach to be greeted by - cool towels! What an absolute delight, they were.",3.8

Reddit/aviation,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Interesting. Welp time to move get practicing on the MSflight and then find out where Alice springs is.

I’m not a pilot I just lurk here because I dream I will be one day. Please disregard this simple fact as it pertains to my daydream. I have. Then there aren’t a lot of taxi ways so I imagine an A380 needs most of the strip. So down to the end and turn around. Does that require the tractor? I bet it can turn within the distance of the strip? Crank the wheel left...power up the right engine. Spinneroo. Then go...just that simple.

As much as I dislike George Brandis, people do have a right to be bigots, out response should be to dislike and ridicule those people, not to outlaw thoughts as some wish to. Likewise, people are allowed to be arseholes, our response shouldn't be to ban being rude. The only argument that should hold any water over Uluru is that they have some sort of limited sovereignty over the site, if that sovereignty gives them the right to stop climbs then so be it.

It was largely ignored to justify colonisation and ignore indigenous claims. Which was the whole reason behind the renaming of 'Ayers Rock' back to Uluru. Also your quip about the swan is not going to age well. There are several independent pushes within the current gov't that are pushing for renaming localities with dual names or just outright.

Such friendly staff that greet you, and a world of exploration awaits (if you can get past the sandpit to start with, my kids can't!) The cafe has several different options mainly for light snacks, and the coffee is good! Our favourites are the dingoes, the bird show, and ultimate is the nocturnal house, one of the biggest I've been in! We've been coming here for a few years, and i discovered an exhibit we've never seen! (Pram doesn't do a lot of off roading) the fish of the finke river system, a large wall based aquarium filled with fish! And of course the perentie along side it. Not the most beautiful of creatures (sorry) NT the bustards have my 3 year olds heart.. Although what some would deem pricey for a day pass, if you get here early and make the most of the guides daily talks and meander through all the park has to offer, it is definitely worth it.

About 8.5 km return to carpark. Water tank about half way, but TAKE some water. (saw several people without). Take a billy for morning tea if you want. Best time to do it is early morning and wander back about lunchtime. Have a swim in the pool /waterfall. The more water you cross along the path to get there , the better the waterfall. The hardest parts are the initial hill climb (on a track the rangers use in their 4X4) and at the end the stairs down into the Gorge (holding the chain). The rest is general bushwalking on either sandy or rocky paths. This spot still has potential to have you on your own with just the waterfall.",3.6
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"For reference Katherine and Tenant creek have a higher homocide rate than Detroit USA. Violent crime is absolutely rampant, people do get bashed in broad daylight. For example August has 98 Assaults not including DV, for a population of 33 thousand, that’s 296 per 100k, if we add the DV it jumps to 515 per 100k. All of QLD had 5,145 including DV, that’s a rate of 91 per 100k. You’re 3-6x more likely to be a victim of assault in Alice Springs than in QLD. If I jump down to Brisbane region, it’s 891 assaults, with a rate of 55 per 100k, so now it’s 6-10x more likely to be a victim of assault in Alice Springs than in Brisbane. Stats sources from NT PFES and QPS. “A bit more dangerous” is a wildly inaccurate take. As a Warlpiri man myself, the NT crime and assault rates are an absolutely a disgrace, if it was just petty theft crimes and car stealing, it’d be barely worth a mention. You don’t shut down a town and mass deploy police for a thievery problem like in mid year riots lead too. Highest Homocide rate, Assault rate, sexual assault rate and DV rate in the nation.

Always a great moment for us. Visit the Cultural Centre first, to get information, look at the Galleries or have a cup of coffee. A great facility we generally visit 2-3 times. Uluru is a walking paradise, with many short walks on well made paths, or the full circuit 10.6km. Many walks are partly shaded and are easy access for wheel chairs. hence it is great for anyone. No excuses. But do not forget to bring your fly spray or head netting, lots of flies!! The area offers plenty of benches to sit and view the marvellous rock shapes and surrounding vegetation. Sunset viewing is very popular, so get in position early! The colour of Uluru will change every minute, hence have your camera set up, because light conditions and colour changes will catch you out! We will visit again next year. Cant get enough!",4.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I have always wanted to visit Uluru, so when we realised it had a special light exhibition we decided to make that our time to visit. It was extremely hot. Being February. Perhaps something to consider for people not used to the heat (but we thought we didn't have a choice as were told the light exhibition was finishing in March). But it was worth it. Just make sure you get up for the walk around Uluru's base early in the morning. We started at 8.30 and I would've preferred to start earlier (in hindsight) as the heat grew quickly! It's a decent walk around the bottom of the rock. But is flat and easily walked. I think you could easily take a baby buggy made for off road around the bottom! You can also hire Segways if you wish, and they would make your trip around the rock much quicker! You can still climb Ayers Rock, however, the local people request that you don't. After visiting the cultural centre and learning more, we found the desire to climb went. For us it was more important to respect the area, and gain our experience enjoying our time in a more respectful way. Make sure you stop at the sunrise/sunset parking areas for photos. Even if not at those specific times, the vantage points are brilliant and the rock makes for great photography. There are no shops/toilets (one set of toilets at one of the parking areas), so ensure you take enough food/water for the time you're going to be walking. We were told 1 litre per hour and that seemed to work well. And most importantly, take a veil of some sort. I took one of my bee keeping hats, my husband brought a net from the local supermarket (around $7). You need these! The little flies are so annoying! It makes for an unpleasant walk when you are swiping at flies the whole way around. Don't forget to take some time out as you walk around enjoying the scenery and especially remember to turn around and look behind you. We would find it gave us quite a different perspective on many of the times we did this.",3.7

They don't want you to climb the rock for sacred reasons, but some still climb the rock. It takes about 20 mins from the Ayers Rock Resorts to the base of the rock by bus. You need to buy a park pass to enter, they offer multi-day passes also. Things to remember if you go from Dec - Mar is that it will be hot, bring water, bush flies are out (net), good footwear, sunglasses & hat.

And the office says its open to 9pm but at 8pm we were told no its closed. We expected the prices to be high for everything here and weren't disappointed. The indigenous community that looks after the national park do a good job, and we realised that all goods have to be trucked in or by air so that puts the prices up. And Diesel today was $1.99 per litre, so be aware if travelling here you will pay to get what you need. Other than that we enjoyed our stay.",3.5

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited this wonderful place on a guided tour. We did 2 of the three trips to Uluru. The evening sunset was wonderful to see and the sun was shining without a cloud. The changes on the Rock were hard to see as they were gradual. We were advised to take a picture every 5 minutes and then review them later. That was excellent advice as you can only then appreciate the changes. Of course the wine and snacks helped this to also be a wonderful social event too. A sign in one of the village shops amused us ""Hard Rock - No Cafe"". It is still possible to climb Uluru - but only when conditions are right. However the Aboriginals see this place as sacred - so please don't climb. Respect their wishes. It is here that you will gain a great insight to Aboriginal culture. They live by three themes. Men's business. Women's business. Sorry business. You will be told why this leaves them ill equipped for modern life. One of my bucket list things to visit and not disappointed.",4.1
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited the desert park as a couple. We spent 25$ each for the entry. We did expect a bit more for the money. The park is pretty big, so you have to walk long distances to reach the different animal enclosures. But if the weather is not to hot, that is actually pretty nice. Nice sorrounding area and nature. There is a Dingo, Kangaroo, Emu enclosure. We didn't see any Emu, just two dingos (they seemed really exhausted and not well treated) and a few roos in a little enclosure. All bird catches had nearly the same birds, so it was a bit sad to see nothing different while watching the third and forth bird catch. The nocturnal house with all the nocturnal animals were very nice and worth to see! that is probably the best part. We really appreciate all the park guides and staff. Everybody was really friendly. All the explanations about the animals, habitats, etc. seemed very professional. The shows they offer are nice as well. We did enjoy the bird show the most. overall we would recommend it for a nice family day trip with kids. If you are a traveller just visit one of the zoos and you will see all the animals as well.",3.8

Massive alcohol problem like most of the Northern Territory – extreme poverty worsened by the collapse of whatever tourism was around with flights now directly going to Yulara rather than stopping by Alice Springs. You just have to be careful situationally – Don’t leave valuables in your car, don’t wear valuables ideally when you’re walking and don’t really walk around at night time.

The walk took me 2 hours to walk around the rock approximately 10 kilometers but make sure you do it 1st thing before the heat, it’s flat all the way so pretty easy walking. There is a shorter walk you can do and that is approximately 850m that still gets you up close and personal to the rock. Make sure you have lots of water, fly repellent or a fly net as the flies can drive you made depending on the time of year. At the main carpark there is toilets, drinking water taps.

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Loved this place - we arrived reasonably early before it got too crowded (busloads of tourists were dropped off late morning!) and swam in the highest pools, up through the rocks, climbed some smallish boulders to access more secluded pools and a trickling waterfall and small cave right near the very source. If you're into climbing, you could go further and explore, not difficult for someone with climbing experience. Very slippery and risky for the inexperienced. Incredible place, the pools are full of deep holes, but there's lots of shallow boulders to stand on (be careful jumping off rocks into the water - lots of hidden, shallow sharp rocks around). We went down to the infinity edge pool just for photos, but it was crowded, with lots of screaming kids, and not the peaceful wonderland like in the photos! There's another pool at the base, easy access for crocs, so we didn't go in, but people had their kids in there. We liked that it was not an easy climb to the top, it would have been even more crowded if it was a stroll! You'll break a sweat, but as long as you are able bodied, you can get there at your own pace, makes the swim even better! Plenty of spots to stop and rest if you need it (and to allow people to pass). Remember to be courteous to others on the trail!",4.6

There is a lovely picnic/bbq area nearby and we were sorry we did not bring any sausages to cook! The only thing to remember is that driving there you have to drive between 50 - 80 km/hr over the unsealed roads otherwise if you slow down it's a bumpy ride!

We got to the viewing area about 10 minutes before sunrise. It was already full of people. Sunrise was at 6:30, we were told to be back on the bus at 6:40. This is the only time I was ever late to get back on the bus. And I did it on purpose. If you want to get photos or just really enjoy seeing the change of color as the sun comes up this tour in not for you. It is amazing to see Uluru change. But I would have liked to have spent more time there enjoying it. And on this tour, they then take you to an area where you could get out and walk to up close to Uluru. We were given 15 minutes to do this. Again not even close to enough time. There are other tours and tour companies. I wish I would have taken one that had a guided walk around Uluru after the sunrise. There is so much to learn and experience about Uluru. But really all we got was a rushed sunrise. And the coffee and biscuit they offer, I did not stop to get it because I did not want to miss the sunrise. Our travel agent picked this tour for us.

I can't walk very far, ad had LITERALLY barely walked in the front gate when I was greeted by one of the park guides, bringing me out a scooter to save me from having to walk much further. Staff were friendly, helpful, enthusiastic, and the exhibits (a few aviaries, nocturnal house, and something like 7 different habitats) were fantastically put together. In summer the Birds of Prey show is only held in the morning so we missed that, but previous experience tells me the show is well worth coming for. Research the times for presentations during the day before your visit so you can plan. Accessibility for people with mobility issues: Scooters are for hire for $10 for the day, book ahead so you can ensure you get one, especially in tourist season. Almost all exhibits are wheelchair/scooter friendly, and the path around most of the park is bitumen, although for bigger scooters the doors may be slightly narrow. There is a disabled toilet in the Nocturnal House and in the main entrance square. Although again, doors are fairly narrow in the Nocturnal House one so may need assistance. Allow a good few hours for everything. Take lots of water, sunscreen and a hat, but there are fountains everywhere so you can refill your water bottles. LOVED IT!",3.9

Mybe a year ago I got curious about that big rock and was wondering if it was much of a tourist attraction and how close it was to the nearest city.

In American terms Alice Springs like a small town where Kansas City is but the nearest town of of similar size or larger is on the coast. I have driven around 900 miles across a portion of America a number of times. Every 5 to 10 miles, or sometimes as much as 20 miles, there are a gas stations and restaurants. I can’t imagine doing that trip to get to or from Alice Springs and not being able to stop to get supplies. I’m from a pretty average size state, not too large and not too small.

As the sun descended the rock seemed to glow eerily, as if it was lit from within. This painted the massive monolith into a kaleidoscope of colors. This is truly an exceptional site. However, it become a religious experience in the morning as a double rainbow appeared at sunrise. We were all awed as we walked near the base of the massive sandstone monolith.

This our ancestors did, according to the reckoning of our culture, from the Creation, according to the common law from ‘time immemorial’, and according to science more than 60,000 years ago. >This sovereignty is a spiritual notion: the ancestral tie between the land, or ‘mother nature’, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who were born therefrom, remain attached thereto, and must one day return thither to be united with our ancestors. This link is the basis of the ownership of the soil, or better, of sovereignty. It has never been ceded or extinguished, and co-exists with the sovereignty of the Crown. >How could it be otherwise? That peoples possessed a land for sixty millennia and this sacred link disappears from world history in merely the last two hundred years? >With substantive constitutional change and structural reform, we believe this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia’s nationhood. >Proportionally, we are the most incarcerated people on the planet. We are not an innately criminal people. Our children are aliened from their families at unprecedented rates. This cannot be because we have no love for them. And our youth languish in detention in obscene numbers. They should be our hope for the future. >These dimensions of our crisis tell plainly the structural nature of our problem. This is the torment of our powerlessness. >We seek constitutional reforms to empower our people and take a rightful place in our own country. When we have power over our destiny our children will flourish. They will walk in two worlds and their culture will be a gift to their country. >We call for the establishment of a First Nations Voice enshrined in the Constitution. >Makarrata is the culmination of our agenda: the coming together after a struggle. It captures our aspirations for a fair and truthful relationship with the people of Australia and a better future for our children based on justice and self-determination. >We seek a Makarrata Commission to supervise a process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations and truth-telling about our history. >In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we seek to be heard.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I rated this attraction as average as although I found Uluru and it's surrounds wonderful, amazing and beautiful the service I experienced at the nearby Cultural Centre created a negative overview and really let this attraction down. I visited Uluru recently in order to complete the climb to the top before it was closed as this was a ""bucket list"" item I've always wanted to do in my lifetime. I did find the organisation of the park very good with good maps, clean toilets and clearly posted signs and explanations of cultural sights etc. The first day I visited it was drizzling so the climb was closed and I instead walked around the rock and surrounds. My first negative experience occurred when I tried to buy a poncho at the Cultural Centre Shop from a woman behind the counter. She brought one out and stated that it was $5.00. I said ""5 dollars""? and hesitated as I wasn't sure that I needed it/wanted to buy it and within seconds of my response she immediately said to me quite rudely ""it's not for sale anymore"" and took it away. I was so surprised and taken aback by her response I asked her when she came back ""Sorry, did I say something wrong"" but she refused to talk to me saying ""this counter is closed"" and pointing to the nearby coffee shop saying ""you'll have to talk to them there if you want something"". 5 minutes later she was happily smiling at another older customer and selling them the poncho and I was bewildered as she had been unnecessarily rather hostile and rude to me. On the base walk it's advisable of water as there are only a couple of places to get water, one at the start and one at the other side and the walk is 10kms and takes 2 - 3 hours depending upon fitness. There is only one set of toilets at the start of the walk. The walk itself was amazing with spectacular rock formations and beautiful sights all round the rock with every facet of the rock having different colours and structure. That morning the Cultural Centre cafe had been very busy so I decided to come back later that afternoon after my walk to get lunch. I came back about maybe 3pm as I ended up taking longer than I though and the cafe was open but mostly empty. I saw a ham and cheese toastie in the glass cabinet and I asked the staff if I could have that. The response was ""Sorry No - we've turned the toaster maker off"". I said ""maybe could you just turn it on for me"". ""No - it will take too long to heat up and we don't want to have to clean it again"". I tried a couple more times to persuade them but it was to no avail. I then tried to buy an untoasted foccaccio also in the cabinet. I explained that it was okay to have it untoasted but the response was ""No - you can't have that - we don't sell it that way"". I implored a few more times to get one of the sandwiches and explained that I was so very hungry after my walk and had nothing else to eat but they were adamant they would not give me anything. I ended with a cup of tea and a cookie which is all they had apart from muffins and choclolate bars but it in no way sated me and the lack of food made me cranky and not feeling my best, The next day I came out to the park again, watched the sunrise and then climbed to to the top which was absolutely magical and amazing. It made me feel rather sad though knowing that I might never be able to climb the rock again and generations of Australians after me might not have this same experience as it was so very special and beautiful. If you can then definitely bring all your own food and other items such as raincoats etc. I feel that any staff / cafe withholding food to patrons when there's no other food providers for 20kms around is appalling. I would like to mention also that not ALL staff were unfriendly - I did meet some lovely helpful people in the resort and the park and had some great interactions with people like the bus drivers who were all uniformly wonderful. Overall because of my negative experiences and knowing I can't climb anymore I don't know if I'll ever go back. There were ""unfriendly vibes"" I received from not only staff at the Cultural Centre in the park but also the Ayers Rock Resort (specifically the Outback Pioneer Resort) which made me wonder if they really want tourists there at all and also made me want to visit a place where I was treated better and that wasn't such a rip off.",2.8

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Visiting the Alice Springs Desert Park is a bit like taking a mini-tour of several diverse parts of Australia's outback. The design of the park is separated into different vegetated communities - so you meander around easy walking tracks the different plant (and often animal) species you are likely to encounter in each landscape. The Park is thriving and teeming with healthy vegetation - keep an eye out for the signs explaining what the various species are and how they are used. It is an outstanding education facility but is also very enjoyable - the nocturnal house is amazing and a wonderful reprieve from hot midday sun. I have always been disappointed not to have had a whole day at the Park - the shows are scheduled throughout the day but usually only one scheduled time for each so I have never been able to get to all the talks/shows. To give yourself the best chance, perhaps get there early just after opening time.",3.8

You'll see wallabies and the occasional echidna. Can't praise the staff enough. Their knowledge is amazing.

There is a beautiful big pool, reasonably clean amenities and a BBQ/ Camp Kitchen. There are plenty of powered and unpowered sites but make sure you get in early if it is school holidays, otherwise you shouldn't have a problem getting a good site. I would definitely recommend the Nitmiluk Cruise and also the shortest walk. I can't remember the name of the walk but I wouldn't attempt any of the walks unless you have a large bottle of water.

Turns out I was completely wrong, there is a lot more to the desert life than what you can see without any explanation. The park is not very big and walking it can probably take up to one hour. But the most important experience are the talks that explain the life of wildlife and give an introduction to local aboriginal culture. I spent there about 6 hours and left only because there was no more talks that day. Don't try to do it in rush because you'll miss a lot. If you don't have a car, you can get a bus from hotel or if you miss it, there is public transport from the centre of Alice Springs.

So different to anywhere else with bright cooper red desert sand beneath your shoes and unusual looking, inquisitive animals.

After our flight arrived several hours later than expected due to being diverted, on arrival at our hotel (The Outback Pioneer) we purchased a tour direct through our hotel reception desk, for the following day. I would love to see Uluru again and if so, I would recommend booking in advance or perhaps exploring the area without a tour as other reviews have suggested which sounds absolutely amazing. On a practical level, we found a fly net was a must as soon as you arrive outside your hotel you are met with them, but everything adds to the experience and we could not have experienced something so different travelling from Sydney the previous day. We chose to do a joint Kata Tjuta guided group tour, walking between the Olgas and up to the Walpa Gorge, followed by viewing Uluru at the main viewing point at sunset. We found completing both areas tiring in one day and not sure how we survived the intense heat between the Olgas but made a superhuman effort to trek onwards and reach the Walpa Gorge and make use of our limited time. On moving onwards it was great to finish with Uluru at sunset. Visiting Uluru to me was what Australia is at its heart, literally the red centre, and I'm so glad we had the opportunity to travel there.",4.4
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Do not miss this place - absolutely one of the most superb places I've ever been to. Dont be put off by the steep walk - they've graded the track with a machine so its a pretty smooth path for most of the way but there is a steep rocky bit toward the end - wear stable shoes.,4.8

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"It seems all other reviewers only went to the swimming hole. We walked the Pound Trail, 7 kms, called ‘moderate’, in about 4 hours. At the start, most of the area had been burnt so it was rather cleared but fascinating to see the new shoots coming up amidst the destruction. The trail was well marked up and over some hills for the first half or so. Then we hit the dry riverbed. We lost the trail here and had to scramble over some very hefty boulders. It was difficult and scary. We found the trail again and trudged on. Here the landscape changed a lot between climbing more boulders to sandy flatlands. Coming round to the gorge, i can say was pretty spectacular. Again, however, we had to navigate over boulders that at least for me got a bit scary. Those who only take the easy pathway to the swimming hole clearly miss out on the beauty of the area beyond it. Consider that I’m 64, not very fit, and scared of heights as you read this. Regardless, i could do it and I’m glad i did. My advice? Take the easy trail to the swimming hole and walk beyond through the gorge for about 2-3 kms. Then just go back. Maybe after the shrubs grow back the first half would be nicer.",2.9

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Location 5/5 Only 5 km or so from Alice Springs. Service 5/5 Very friendly and knowledgeable staff Value 5/5 It cost us $32 each for an adult but we stayed there for 4 hours (and still did not see the movie) so for that length of time at an attraction we considered it good value. There are many talks and displays during the day and it is possible to spend all day there. A must see is the Bird Show where they show you several of the local bird species and talk about them. They feed them, etc This show is on twice per day so make sure you get to see one of them. Also with the admission you can leave and come back on the same day. So you could do the morning and come back in the afternoon. This is an option as we were not really impressed with the caf (refer separate review - restaurants) Atmosphere 5/5 Great location on the side of the range. You get the feeling of being in the outback but you are close to town. Overall 5/5 A must see in Alice Springs but make sure you allow for plenty of time here. BUT the cafe at the park: Food 3/5 We had morning tea here and the only food options were commercial packaged items which were OK. No prices or menu shown. Coffee was average with very little froth on cappuccino. Not sure if they have better selection for lunch otherwise it would be pre-packaged sandwiches or pies. Service 3/5 Only 1 person serving and she was a bit overwhelmed and not very cheerful. Value 5/5 For what we had it was great value. Coffee, Sparkling Water and 2 cakes for under $15 Atmosphere Nice outdoor area with limited shade and normal run of the mill indoor area.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Original we went to Uluru to climb it as a family,as I had climbed it already 40 years ago. Now I see it differently, as by the end of this trip it really didn't matter whether I climbed it or not. The Aboriginal significance, as environmental damage it does to the upper levels of the rock must be taken into account. (ie The Shield Shrimp in pools on the top must be preserved). It really doesn't matter,as the rock itself has allot to offer. We did the Mala Walk followed by the base walk, to take in the size and Ora of the rock. I'm happy I didn't climb as now I appreciate the rock for what it is, an ICON OF AUSTRALIA. The older photos show how it was.",4.3

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We booked SEIT Uluru Trek to start walking the Rock pre-dawn, and notwithstanding the rain (yes, I heard exceptionally lucky....) we managed a squeak out of the sunrise, and had an incredible walk with our tour guide. Our guide was knowledgable and could explain the history of the aboriginals as we walked around, we had a good discussion on the birds that inhabited the area and generally the history. All-in-all an experience that we thoroughly enjoyed because of our guide, and II would most definitely book again with SEIT.",4.2
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We did the base trek with SEIT tours. This was truly brilliant, we learned so much. The group size is far smaller than their competitors which we prefer.

We had a great time but would definitely recommend doing it with SEIT, they really did make it come alive.",4.2
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"5 day trip to Uluru and around the outback This was my first trip to the Australian outback and it was amazing and makes me look forward to more! I covered two national parks during this trip: Uluru-Kata Kjuta and Watarrka. There are 3 primary sites: - Uluru - Ayer’s rock - Kata Tjuṯa - Kings Canyon My favourite was the King’s Canyon. And if there was limited time, I would recco to do just that one! Each of these are walks, with different terrain and views. Each of these sites can be done via a tour service or yourself. The tours are either during sunrise or sunset, on an avg cos ~$200 per head. If going by yourself, you need to rent a car or atleast in Uluru/ Kata Kjuta, you can take a hop on-hop off bus. Am not sure abt the public transport option at King’s since we had a car. Besides these 3 sites, there are 2 art installations at Uluru and a camel farm with some farm animals that can be seen for free and a 45 minute camel ride that needs to be booked in advance. All tours and tickets can be booked the tourist centre in the resort. Park tickets have to be purchased additionally, which can only be done online. Uluru +KK park ticket is $38pp valid for 3 days ( extendable) ane King’s is $10 pp. The weather was amazing early June- avg temperature between 9 am to 5 pm was 16-17 degrees C, a light jacket was enough. Before and after, it was closer to 12-13. It was sunny through the day. Will share details of the accommodation post the itinerary below. Here’s what we did: ( 2 of us) Day 1: Landed in the afternoon, relaxed and went for the Drone show during sunset. It included unlimited wine and a cheese platter, which was good enough as dinner! The sunset was beautiful, while the drone show was ok. Some information was shared about the aboriginal people and their history but it was nothing different from the info available at the tourist centre and while the effort of putting up the installation was commendable, the show was quite plaid. Tour lasted 90 minutes. Day 2: Camel farm ( self) in the day and and Field of lights show after sunset. we chose the one without wine and canapés. It’s a set of 90,000 hand made lights on display. They take you there at night and the whole effect is great. But again, the info shared was boring and limited to how many lights were used, who made it and for how long has it been open. Amongst the drone show and this one, I’d say this was better. Day 3: we booked the hop on - hop off bus to Uluru ($49pp) and took the Sunrise pick up at 6.05 am. The coach takes you to a sunrise viewing area after which it drops you off to the start of a walk around Ayer’s rock.There are several walks across each site- you can either cover a full round or can do shorter walks. We started with the intention of starting at the Mala walk and completing the whole round but we were kinda bored after 2 hours and took the bus to go to the cultural centre instead. There was an awesome presentation by a senior aboriginal lady, supported by an English speaking gentleman and truly provided some insights about the people and their lives. The cafe at the centre was nice too and they served coffee and some rolls, wraps and pies. The sunrise was the highlight and I would certainly recco it. The walk was very easy- flat, on red sand, very quiet and also easily accessible by wheelchair. The Sunset can be viewed at the Sunset viewing point or even at a look around area near the resort. Day 4: We rented a car from the Ayer’s rock airport ( because all tours were full)and drove to Kata Kjuta. We did the full rim walk which took us a little under 3 hours at an easy pace. The views were astounding. The walk had pebbled paths and also involved climbing over the big rocks of Kata Tjuṯa. Post the walk, we drove to the Sunset viewing point closeby and then got back to the resort. Just a 30-35 minute drive. Day 5: we checked out and left at around 8 am for Kings canyon. We stopped for some food and rest and started the rim walk a little before 1 pm (else the drive takes not more than 3 hours) and took 2 hours and 40 mins. The walk, the views, the experience was just brilliant. You walk over several rocks which cannot be seen from the outside. You’d never guess what ur in for, till you get to the inside of the canyon. There were very few ppl along this trail, as all tours are only during sunrise and sunset. We ended the walk and then went over near the Discovery resort’s Lurkita lookout to see the sunset, with some drinks. There is also a light towers experience ( a light installation) but we didn’t choose that. There are also day and overnight tours available for King’s canyon from Uluru. Next day, we left at 9.30 am, stopped at King’s creek station to have breakfast (Amazing!!) and fuel up and drove back to the Ayer’s rock airport. Kings canyon was not part of our itinerary at first and this place was recommended by some folks who we met at Uluru. Am sooo glad they did! There is also an airport near King’s canyon. Accommodation: Ayer’s rock - only has one resort called the Ayer’s rock resort which comprises 4 hotels- Outback, Sails in the Desert, Emu walk apartments and The Lost Camel. Outback has a hotel and lodge/ dorm option. The others had only rooms. The outback dorm costs 60$ pp and had 4 beds ie 2 bunk beds. Very clean and comfy. Common bathrooms and showers for everyone including the lodge rooms. Outback had a bar, a fast food kiosk, a restaurant and a live band, a communal kitchen with bbq et al. From the looks of it, all the hotel rooms across the 4 seemed pretty basic, only the size of rooms changed. We thought Outback was most lively, we went around to try food at each restaurant across the resort. Staff everywhere were great. Kings canyon: we booked a room with Discovery. Clean room, had a TV, fridge, double bed and kettle. Common bathroom and showers, communal kitchen. Some tips: - Book in advance - tours, hop-on-hop-off buses get booked and have limited slots. So the earlier you book, better it is. The tourist centre shuts at 5 pm at Ayers. For Kings canyon, can book at the resort. - Face net for flies - there are LOADS of flies and they stick to ur face and body. It’s a task to keep them away and hike and not lose ur balance! Lots of people had purchased face nets to keep the flies away. - Car rental- we found that car rental is cheaper online than at the rental shops in the resort. FYI, we found that cars charge you a rental for a limited mileage, any additional mileage used beyond that is charged a fee. Eg we paid 220 a day for rental, had to return the car with a full tank and had to pay a fee of 25c per Km over 200 kms driven. Plus some location fee of 37$ + GST. Total car rental with fuel and excess etc for 48 hours cost us $740 - Super markets- The Ayer’s rock super market opens 9 am to 8 pm. Kings canyon is from 7 am- 7 pm. Both do not have alcohol. Stuff is 30-40% more expensive than in the city - Drinking Water is available to refill at resorts but tastes different. - Food: at Ayer’s, all the hotels have restaurants. There is hot roast chicken available at the supermarket too. And some pre packed salads, besides fresh fruits, veggies, cheese, yogurt, marinated meats, cookies, cup noodles, snacks. You can borrow a set of cutlery and cooking pots/knives from the reception ( atleast at Outback hotel) and cook it at the communal kitchen. At King’s, there is a sole restaurant that serves food and drinks. The store has some sandwiches, cup noodles, fruits and cheese. - Alcohol: only available at bars and restaurants, not in the super market. Outback hotel has a bottle shop from where you can buy alcohol ( wines, beers and hard liquor) - If you want to cover all 3 sites, the trip can be done in 3-4 days if you just make sure you book the tours in advance or have a car",4.2

There isn't a big ledger in the sky of Official Traditional Names You Must Use Or It Doesn't Count, especially not for natural features no one built.

Reddit/howislivingthere,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Honestly, although its easy to point out the issues and cruticize, its harder for me to actually point out a solution, partially due to the fact that i am not super familiar with the systems of land ownership and even rule of law or social hierarchy in traditional communities or outstations. I would love for an aboriginal who lives in one of these communities to be part of the coversation. But the level of violence that aboriginal communities experience and that others in the outback are subjected to as a result is very destructive and beginning to be a subject of national embarrasment. I heard a story of an italian backpacker that was machete'd to death for telling a group of aboriginal youth to pick up their litter (somewhere in north queensland i believe?) Since foreigners see australia as a very safe country, thry are much less likely to be ""streetwise"" in situations like this when visiting certain areas of the country in order to avoid being victims of semi random violence. There's no doubt that the rise of social liberalism in bigger australian metropolitan areas and the switch from seeing aboriginals as savages to doing land acnowledgements and venerating some sort of sanitized version of their culture (almost viewing them as ""noble savages"") has somewhat emboldened aboriginal youth to commit crimes against european australians as some sort of ""revenge"", causing increased racism against aboriginals by white people, with people bringing up the old native police, threatening to bring back their ""grandfather's hunting licenses"", etc. The whole situation is getting more and more tense and being completely ignored, since the population densities of the outback are so low and everything is so isolated. The government needs to seriously look at the management of government funds by leaders in aboriginal communities, and punish those who embezzle them accordingly. It then needs to take a much more active role in making sure aboriginal youth attend regular education and have less access to alcohol and drugs, and put stricter punishments in place for violent offenders. There also needs to be greater investments in infrastructure and economic incentives to ensure aboriginals have places to work, which is difficult due to how isolated they are (the only real jobs are in cattle stations much of the time). Beyond that, it is a cultural issue. The importance of family groups, and fights between them, as well as the level of violence against others (and against women, which is abysmal) are cultural holdovers from the tribal days. There is no pretty solution here, which is why stealing the children and attempting to ""re educate"" them was attempted in the past (after the pastorialists had forced them off all the good grazing land, of course), but the reality of the present day situation is that, unfortunately, aboriginals have to assimilate to the settled way of life, which is something these groups have largely completely failed to do. Their complete reliance on government handouts has to change also (most of them do not work, another fact which causes resentment). I would love for a pure blooded aboriginal (not someone with 1/4 aboriginal blood, as the situation is likely very different for them) from the alice springs area to provide a better insight. In my time in australia, in the interior, i didnt have much of an opportunity to get any persectives like that unfortunately.",2.3

I moved here on an 18 month contract in 2017 with every intention of moving back once that time was up. But somehow Alice Springs became the place I consider home.

This is a place with a lot of historical, archaeological, anthropological, and geological value and this is the reason why Uluru is a UNESCO site. The place is magical and I really believe that is a place that you have to explore on your own. You need to be free. You have to listen the nature and see how the colours change over time. Just rent a car and explore it. It is very easy and gloriously unbelievable. You should spent at least 2 days. See the sunset, walk around the base, explore the different paths. Independent tourist can see the sunset from a large area, not too crowded to which is quite easy to arrive. It is better that the sunset area for tour groups which is very crowded and more distant from Uluru.",4.3
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Being on the Ghan meant we had an exclusive tour of the facility - the usual free flight display is a 10am - ours was later and was for us only. After being dropped off at the park we were met by two experienced guides and were given an introduction to the work done there. People with mobility issues could use scooters so everyone had the opportunity to do the full tour and walk. First animal encounter was at the dingo enclosure followed by the free flight theatre. No eagles, kites or falcon this time - we were introduced to a lovely Barn owl. The handler explained that the bird was wary of the tawny frogmouth perched in the theatre rafters and had to retrieve the owl when it decided to fly back to its home. The brief display was great. The theatre has tiers of seating and good views of the handler with bird. Thegroup was split into two and then did a tour of the other areas including reptiles, nocturnal area and raptors. There is a café for snacks and light meals and beverages and also a gift shop. A wonderful and colourful children's playground was near cafe. If you haven't seen Australian animals this is a great introduction - otherwise you can spend quiet time at the café - outdoor undercover seating. Enjoy",4.0

Jerry is an aboriginal park guide that can tell you the coolest things about the aboriginal lifestyle, the animals and the park. Because of Jerry I really liked this park.

There was also a nocturnal house filled with cool animals and reptiles and you were able to go into the kangaroo area.

You walk on paved paths through a large area which is fenced off ... so the animals are not totally “in the wild”, but means you will see them. The little mala wallabies in particular would not survive outside the enclosure now, as they are way too friendly to feral cats and marauding dogs and foxes. So, we saw lots of animals, including a fight between a burrowing beettong and a brush-tailed one, over a very cute female ... very unusual behaviour which interested our guide too.

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Because it was dry for 15 years and look at what's happened. Very clearly having a dry town isn't a long term solution. If turning it into a dry town helps it should only be considered in the short term AND 1) Evidence based addiction programs (and I'm not talking AA/NA) be put in place 2) monitoring of other substance abuse is undertaken - guaranteed if you ban alcohol other addiction rates go up 3) some kind if responsible drinking program be implemented. I wouldn't be surprised if some of this is due to the 18-33 demographic not being socialised to alcohol at all. Lastly, we need to know if the crime epidemic is actually fuelled by alcohol or if it's a correlation or coincidence. Rates of crime have risen since the end of last year... so has economic stress (everything is more expensive). Also DV rates have risen everywhere due to covid - is it possible that the Alice springs is experiencing a delayed response because its more isolated?",2.4
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,One of the most picturesque places to be found between Alice Springs and Glen Helen Gorge drive.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,We arrived via the Ghan on a very hot day. Many of the animals were hiding in the shade. Our tour was altered to more of a talk in the presentation hall which was very informative. The Birds of Prey show was outstanding. Many of the birds come very close to the audience. The nocturnal exhibit housed many interesting animals. Highly recommend the park.,4.8

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"I really think people who are super entitled and having a whinge about the top pools being closed should really just jog on. For starters, who goes anywhere without doing research these days? Gunlom top pools have been closed for quite some time, so how can anyone with the internet not know that. Secondly, There is so much more that Kakadu has to offer, than a few, overdone, instagram shots. Sure it is a nice place, but If you have any type of intelligence, or cultural awareness, you will remember that Kakadu is ABORIGINAL land. It is a sacred place, and if the traditional owners want to close part of it, then respect that and stop complaining. Not only is Kakadu their home, it is their sacred land. In your own home, you have decisions about who visits and who doesn't. It's the same thing. Entitled people, unfortunately seem to think the world is theirs to access at all times. You forget, it is not an open, public spot and the only reason you have access to any of it, is because the Traditional owners have allowed you to come in. If you're only at Kakadu for the Gunlom top pools, then you're really missing out on all that Kakadu has to offer. Go do something else. Everyone has seen photos of the top pools to death. And we all know that's why you're there. Instagram shots. Go do something cultural for a change.",2.9

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We visited the park and the visitors centre there is modern with good displays and a cafe. We did the Baruwei Walk , Butterfly Gorge and Southern Rockhole hikes which is about 20 km. You walk through varying vegetation but the main highlights are the viewing points over the Katherine river and gorges and going down the Butterfly Gorge and the Southern Rockhole. The Butterfly Gorge has a small stream running through it and there is beautiful flora along its banks. The stream finally makes its' way into Katherine Gorge. Hiking along the Southern Rockhole is really quite a rough track with a lot of boulder hopping. Eventually you reach Katherine Gorge where there is a nice swimming area if the park deems it clear of salt water crocodiles. The freshwater crocodiles are not a significant danger to humans. Overall this hike is quite challenging due to the terrain and heat. You need to take at least 2 L of water with you but there is a place to replenish on the way. Of course you can visit the lower to gorges by boat and in the second gorge kayaking is available. This is a great place to visit especially for walking and to experience the dramatic and beautiful country.",3.9

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did Katherine Gorge as a day trip from Darwin, which I booked in a hurry not really researching all the providers available. I have always in the past opted for smaller family owned operators as I beleive these deliver more value for money and an overall better experience than the larger companies and my theory was proven correct doing this day tour with APT touring- A large expensive company. The tour itself was excellent and well organised starting with a visit to Adelaide River War Cemetery, followed by a stop at the Adelaide River roadhouse for Breakfast (NOT INCLUDED and cost $17 a head for buffet) . Next it was on to Pine Creek for a short stop before getting to Katherine Gorge for our cruise. The cruise included a Fabulous lunch on board before then getting off and on to another boat for further cruising down a second gorge which was spectacular. After a most enjoyable time at the Gorge we continued on to Edith Falls where we could cool off with a swim which was most refreshing. After this the trip back to Darwin, some three hours was broken up by the screening of the movie ""Australia"" on the bus, which was most enjoyable and fitting. A further dinner stop back At Adelaide River Road house (another $17 at your own expense) and homeward bound. My shortcomings with this tour were the cost and value for money and the tour guide himself. It was quite obvious that ""lindsay"" must be due to retire shortly or if not - he should as his commentary was monotonous and tiresome. He was completely unenthused and even somewhat rude to some of the passengers who would enquire as to what was happening next, getting a short a response from him of Wait and you'll find out ! Not good when they charge you $200 a ticket for this trip. I had my husband and two kids with me also so having already outlayed some $680 for the four of us I was unimpressed with a further $17 a head x 4 for breakfast and dinner, so we opted for a pie at the service station on the way back.

Deep Reds of rock face, natural rock art created millions of years past, deep yellow and cream ochres...it is never ending. We swim a lot back home and are used to cold water - BUT...the water in the gorge was very very cold (September 2018). Be careful!!

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's always a challenge to see the most iconic places in the World. We have all seen so many images over the years we find the the reality can be disappointing. I wouldn't say that was the case with Uluru but I guess it depends on your point of view. It certainly pays to see this amazing feature up close, as the sun rises or sets to see it change colors and shadows. It also pays to view it at other times - there is something majestic about the way it towers over the surrounding landscape as you see it for the first time, or from one of the distant viewing points as it shimmers in the summer heat. It is very impressive in my opinion. The various tours one can take to see it are, of course, over-priced. I am not religious or spiritual but I respect the desire of those who would rather tourists didn't climb Uluru and I would never do so. I don't get any feeling of this as a ""spiritual place"" as I don't even know what that means as nobody ever seems to be able to define what they mean by that phrase but I am very glad to have visited this impressive place for myself.",4.2
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just don't do it in a shit old Hilux that can't go over 110km/h, with no AC during the middle of Summer. It was still worth it though to be honest, drove from Sydney to Adelaide to Katherine via Uluru, then back to Sydney via QLD.",2.7
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is the Red Centre of Australia. Many foreigners know of the main Uluru rock which stands up out of the earth, and lots of tourists visit the sun rise and sunset viewpoints. These are good - but are crowded which is fine if you are happy with that. After our sunrise experience we drove to the other side for an up close walk to the big rock - which helps us appreciate how awesome the rock really is. Because we arrived early, circa 06.30 am we had a fairly uncrowned experience. If you want an even better experience visit the Olgas - or as they are properly called Kuta Tjuta range of huge rocks. Personally I found them even better - especially the walk into the canyon which goes more than 0.5 Km into the rock. Truely awesome - compare well with great places I have visited in the Himalayas. A practical tip: you can go on the guided tours at fairly high cost. If there are 2 or more of you it's more cost effective to hire your own car and it cost just 25 Aus entry per person for 3 days to the Park, plus the petrol. Importantly your own vehicle gives you flexibility about timing, length of time in each spot. A final thought - the various guidebooks all say the indigenous people would prefer us not to climb Uluru. I respect that and would recommend you not to climb out of respect for the people who lived here long time before white man landed in Australia.",4.0

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Gunlom has a plunge pool which is wheelchair (and croc) accessible and it is nice if you can't climb like a mountain goat - but if you can handle a 20 min steep rocky climb you MUST head up top to the half dozen large pools above the waterfall that feeds the plunge pool as it is one of nature's finest creations!

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A couple of reasons in my view. 1. They haven't allowed time for the name change to sink in - Uluru was dual-named for years before switching over to primarily be Uluru. 2. It was done too fast, with too much other change such as the Voice and Welcome to Country. A great many people are over the whole thing being forced down their throats and therefore are pushing back. 3. The spelling is just silly in my opinion. ""K'gari"" is pronounced ""Gurri"" or ""Garry"". Given no Aboriginal languages had a written form, spellings should be phonetic and people should be able to correctly pronounce the name by reading the word - like Uluru for example. The ""K"" in ""K'gari"" is always silent, so why is it there.",2.2

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is just a rock, but one very fascinating rock. The clouds at sunset could have been more cooperative but we did get to see it for a few minutes with the setting sun lighting it up and that was very special. The clouds were much more cooperative during sunrises. We spent one morning at Talinguru Nyakunytjaku for a spectacular sunrise. We would have liked to climb to the top but it is obvious that is very much discouraged. Any excuse is used not to open the climb.We were there for four mornings and it never opened during that time and apparently was not open the morning before our arrival either. One morning high winds were used to justify not opening the climb even though the ""winds"" were never more than a slight breeze. Another morning it remained closed due to rain in the forecast. A light rain did eventually develop for about ten minutes but long after we would have returned from the walk up. Aussies did much of the complaining about the fact it did not open but foreign tourists travel thousands of miles for the chance to walk up the rock. It would probably be better to simply permanently close it rather than teasing everyone that it may open when they show up early in the morning to do so even though it will probably not open. There are other beautiful walks to do though. We did the base walk and saw a kangaroo and a Thorny Devil as well as taking in the view of the rock up close. We also did the Kuniya Walk to Matitjulu Waterhole and the Mala Walk to Kantaju Gorge which were also very worthwhile to do. The flies like to get into the corners of your eyes and have a drink so netting for your head is recommended and is easy to find in Yulara. A very special place.",3.5

Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Oh I tried to avoid jargon. Its in any fluid mechanics book you'll find. It's called a hydraulic jump. Whenever fluid moves very rapidly its profile thins and becomes supercritical. When the flow loses enough energy, due to friction or something, it jumps to subcritical flow. This results in a great deal of energy being dissipated into the surrounding environment and causes a great deal of erosion. Engineers have to design spillways very carefully to ensure that the jump happens in an area that isn't vulnerable, if not it has enough energy to literally tear soil or weaker materials apart. I should not have worded my response the way I did, because I am not 100% sure if this is the case with Uluru, but it seems to be the most plausible explanation.",2.1

Our guide Nadia picked us up from the hotel at 5am and we set off in the dark. We were given breakfast packs to carry ourselves, although we decided to take only the bare essentials to save the weight. When we started it was cold and dark and there was a full moon which was very atmospheric. The sun was just starting to rise and we walked on the soft sand hearing many interesting facts from Nadia who knew so much about the plants, wildlife and culture of the area. We stopped often to hear stories about the Aboriginal dream time and see the wonderful rock paintings, caves and waterholes. Half way round we stopped for breakfast near where people climb the rock. There are clean toilets there and seats under shade. The second half was harder going because of the heat but there were plenty of stops to look at more fascinating things. Nadia paced the tour well and was conscious of other groups on the track, holding us back sometimes so we could experience a particular area without other people there. There were only 5 people in our tour which made it very personal. It was quite tiring, at nearly 4 hours of walking, even though the track itself is flat and easy. Make sure you've got good walking shoes and lots of layers to take off as the day heats up. We went through 1 litre of water each which was less than we'd planned for but most of that was drunk in the second half of the tour when the sun was up.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We visited Uluru for the first time and it was magical. We bought our pass for three days and enjoyed every minute. We walked the base which is an easy walk and worthwhile. We went and watched the sunset and went out to watch the sunrise.

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">1. The Uluru Statement is literally a real physical signed document, like the Declaration of Independence. There are photographs of it. Find me a photograph that shows all so-called ""26 pages"". It doesn't exist. The only thing that was signed was 1 page. Again, not quite. The signatures you see were signed onto a border piece that a reprint of the first page of the statement was stuck onto, that is the signatories signed a blank page. The photo you are looking at is a reproduction of the reprint that signatures were added to post-hoc. Unlike the Declaration of Independence, the Uluru Statement wasn't handwritten, it was typed by Davis et. Al on a computer somewhere *before* the Uluru Dialoge. That aside, simply claiming signatures make it original is a poor argument as is claiming that a photograph of something makes that something original (aside from the fact that not all the first page of the statement *is original*). *As an aside* - In your link to the ""photo"" - was an article on a speech made my Davis that day. Oddly at 1h10m of that speech Davis claims that Climate Change was a prominent theme during the dialogues. That's odd because it's not mentioned a single time in any document, minutes or reports - it seems Davis is fibbing again. >Listing all the random things different people say in meetings, often contradictory because different people say different things, is not a ""statement"" of any sort. I dont think anyone claiming the dialogue minutes form part of the Uluru Statement. The statement itself released under FOI however has page numbers embedded within the document from page 1 to page 26 - the dialogues are a separate document after that. And yes page 1 to page 26 are >noun noun: statement; plural noun: statements 1. a definite or clear expression of something in speech or writing.",1.8

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">What in the proposed amendment will mean Indigenlhs people have a specific extra legal right? Link it and explain how Indigenous people will have more rights than anyone else. Because as far as I can tell all it does is create an advisory body. Easy. All citizens can vote and make representations to their local member for parliament. The voice allows an additional ""representation"" to parliament (it doesn't say advice) that can affect all laws and policies - but only for a certain race - regardless of individual circumstances. Parliament and the high court determine the powers of the voice, you and I aren't constitutional scholars so we can't understand the full implications. You will have kids of millionaire aboriginals such as Buddy Frankline, Adam Goodes, Warren Mundine etc who have additional rights based not on need, but only because they were born into the ""correct"" race - that's fundamentally racist. Further, look at the ""extended"" version of the Uluru statement from the ""heart"". There is nothing in there about closing the gap, improving health outcomes or employment for aboriginal Australians - it's all about money, separatism, land rights, power, reparations and revenge. It's not ""statement from the heart"", but hatred from the heart.

Treaty was seen as a pathway to **recognition of sovereignty** and for achieving future meaningful reform for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. **Treaty would be the vehicle to achieve self determination, autonomy and self-government**. > >The Dialogues discussed who would be the parties to Treaty, as well as the process, content and enforcement questions that pursuing Treaty raises. In relation to process, these questions included whether a Treaty should be negotiated first as a national framework agreement under which regional and local treaties are made. In relation to content, the Dialogues discussed that **a Treaty could include** a proper say in decision-making, the establishment of a truth commission, **reparations, a financial settlement (such as seeking a percentage of GDP)**, the resolution of land, water and resources issues, **recognition of authority and customary law**, and guarantees of respect for the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. In relation to enforcement, the **issues raised were about the legal force the Treaty should have, and particularly whether it should be backed by legislation or given constitutional force.** &#x200B; >There were different views about the priority as between Treaty and constitutional reform. For some, Treaty should be pursued alongside, but separate from, constitutional reform.For others, **constitutional reform** that gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a voice in the political process **will be a way to achieve Treaty.** > >A constitutionally entrenched Voice to Parliament was a strongly supported option across the Dialogues. It was **considered as a way by which the right to self-determination could be achieved**.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples need to be involved in the design of > >any model for the Voice. There was a concern that the proposed body would have insufficient power if its constitutional function was ‘advisory’ only, and there was support in many Dialogues for it to be given stronger powers so that it could be a mechanism for providing ‘free, prior and informed consent’. Any Voice to Parliament **should be designed so that it could support and promote a treaty-making process**. .... Some other racist ideas coming ""from the heart"" - although to be fair it doesn't look like this made it through: &#x200B; >A number of Dialogues considered ways that political representation could be achieved other than through the proposed constitutional Voice. These included through the **designation of seats in Parliament for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** (although there was some concern that these politicians would be bound by party politics), the **creation of a ‘Black Parliament’** that represents communities across Australia. There was discussion about how these reforms could be connected to a constitutional body.

It's called Gafa* Country for a reason. If you are driving from Uluru to Alice Springs (or reverse) via Lasseter and Stuart Highways (i.e. not doing the Mereenie Loop), if your car can handle some light offroad and there hasn't been any major rain recently, consider taking the Ernest Giles Road. So long as you have a 4WD and the road's been graded recently it's pretty easy. There's much less traffic, it's a beautiful drive, and you can check out the Henbury Meteorite Craters if you're into that sort of thing. The impact occurred about 4,700 years ago, and is one of only three impacts in history that have occurred in populated areas (i.e. people were actually in the area to directly witness the impact). At least one of the local Aboriginal peoples has a story about the craters being formed by a great ""fiery devil"" that came down from the sun. *Great Amounts of Fuck All.",3.8

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Well it's simple economics, because no one wants to live here there is a huge shortage of skilled and non skilled workers, so if you are prepared to put up with living in a place that is essentially like a town in a 3rd world country then you will reap the many benefits like living rent free, vehicles provided and making a huge amount of money. Ironically this town is a gold mine, people would be surprised to know how many self made millionaires Alice has produced and still does, these people could live anywhere in Australia but this is where the coin is. I've heard of numerous young couples who have moved up here to grind it out and within a few years they own their home out right. This is the strange juxtaposition of Alice Springs. Lawlessness and town camps that are no different to the slums you see in 3rd world countries, while five minutes across town and you find yourself on the golf course estate which is almost exclusively where the wealthy have built their mansions, which is where they keep their Ferrari's and Lamborghinis. And you know what, they deserve every penny they've made.

I brought a one litre bottle and filled it about five times. My only gripe with the park is that it's very difficult to get there if you don't have a car. I managed to hitch a ride up there, and the website led me to believe a bus could take me back, but there was no bus, and I ended up having to take a pricey taxi back into Alice Springs.

The birds were all familiar to me ... but the information was often new! I also went to another presentation about Aboriginal survival in the desert. I realised that I had to choose between the presentations and the wildlife displays. I would have preferred that the ticket was a two-day re-entry one, so that I could fit everything in! However, I thoroughly enjoyed the nocturnal house, and other displays. Shaded picnic grounds are provided - just as well, since the cafe was inexplicably closed on the day of my visit. I returned at night for the Nocturnal Tour. Fantastic! Although everything seen could also be seen in the Nocturnal House, it was somehow more satisfying to see the animals in real life hopping around my feet! The only disadvantage was the amount of walking involved! Much of that could have been solved if I'd planned my time from the beginning ... but who is that organised?? A thoroughly enjoyable visit!",4.1
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This has to be one of the most amazing places on our earth. Sunset, sunrise Uluru does not disappoint photographers or spectators. The only fly in the ointment is that some bright spark has decided to float a huge white blimp around the rock at these times. It is probably OK if you go on windy days when the blimp can't fly. When it is up it takes up a considerable chunk of Uluru and certainly not something I want in my photos. Our sunset dinner was spoiled by this great white oddity blocking views. What a shame. It looks so out of character even where it is moored on the edge of town.",3.4
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The National Park is a huge rip off at $25/person for entry and very little to do inside. There are two geological formations in the park: Ayers Rock (which they now want us to call “Uluru”) and the Olgas (another rock formation). There are basically four ways to enjoy the park: (1) sit on one of 3-4 platforms throughout the park and stare at the rocks; (2) take one of two short hikes in the Olgas, (3) spend several hours walking around the base of Ayers Rock, or (4) climb Ayers Rock. We did (or tried to do) all four, and none were particularly memorable or worth the visit. Viewing Platforms: The viewing platforms were extremely poorly positioned—you can’t even see the sunrise from the so-called sunrise viewing platform. If you search for pictures of sunrise over Uluru or Ayers Rock, you see a lot of pictures with the rock and the sun rising to one side, not the view you get at the platform at all. Worth going to snap a picture, but not worth a trip to the dessert. Hikes: They Valley of the Winds hike is frequently closed due to heat. We rushed the day we arrived to make it there before 11am when they close it. It was a nice little hike, but not challenging at all. The brochures said it would take 4 hours, we finished in 2 at a fast but leisurely pace. It would be worth traveling to the area if there were more hikes, but that’s really the only one. Base Walk: We did part of the base walk but got bored and turned back. All you’re doing is walking on a flat path around the walk. Not challenging, not intellectually stimulating, and you don’t even get good views of Ayers Rock because you’re next to it. Climb: The aboriginal people worship Ayers Rock and so they don’t like it when people climb it, though climbing is still permitted. Problem is, there’s very little information about the climb and they frequently close it for no apparent reason. The first day it was closed after 8am due to extreme heat (the temperature was forecast to hit 36 degrees, but it never got that hot). The second day it was closed all day due to a potential for rain. When we were there at 7am it was blue skies with a few fluffy white clouds, yet the climb was closed because there was a possibility of rain that evening. There is no communication about when it will or won’t be open, so you can’t plan ahead and you can’t predict based on the weather. Overall, we were sorely disappointed in not being able to climb, mainly because there weren’t other challenging hikes (or really anything else to do). We ended up at the pioneer bar at the resort instead of in the park, and although it was a nice bar, not worth a $1000 trip. We’ve visited multiple National Parks in Australia (Queensland, Tasmania) and this was by far the most disappointing. The visitor information was poor; it seems like the aboriginal people that now run the park want the money from tourism but want people to stay at the nearby resorts instead of actually visiting the park.",1.9

The only thing is they don't give you quite enough time to fully enjoy the splendor as you had to have the bikes back by 12am.

Do a self guided tour, using the CD player which is available for a small deposit. Name sure you have your camera charged up to capture the wildlife, there a few big Red Kangaroos in the park, as well as stunning flowers and of. Course The Wild Bird show.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a small walk through a desert landscape with a series of exhibits, widely spaced. It also has talks every half hour. if you like the talks, you can have a wonderful day of it, going from interesting talk to interesting talk all day long. If you came instead basically to look at exhibits, you may be disappointed, as I was. There are precious few exhibits, mostly of birds, and most of the birds are of swallow size, though more colorful. Many of the same birds pop up in exhibit after exhibit. My stroll through the park took 45 minutes to see everything, though if one likes birds more than I do, and lingers more, it would take a bit longer. the only way to fill out the day, or a half day, is if you are into the talks (admittedly, as many people are).",3.7
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Leaving the motel at five in the morning, bleary-eyed and yawning, we were oddly thrilled to be awake so early. We were on our way to Gunlom falls, and it was to be my first visit. 18 years in the NT, and I'd never been to one of the most iconic locations in my backyard. I was determined for this trip to be a perfect final memory of the NT before I moved south for university. Pulling up in the quiet car park at the foot of the cliff, not another person was in sight. The falls had only just been opened to the public again following the wet season, and we had anticipated a lot more foot traffic on our hike to the still creek. Instead, we were accompanied by the early morning songs of birds and the soft buzzing of flies and mosquitoes. Sweat dripped into our eyes as we climbed the uneven path, our legs aching and lungs burning. 30 minutes passed, and our limbs filled with the heavy weight of exhaustion. Finally, the ground levelled and dipped, leading down to the crystal clear waters of Gunlom. We piled our backpacks onto the flattest and shadiest rock we could find, stripped away from our swimmers, and jumped into the freezing water. We let the cold water wash over our heat flushed skin. We stayed in the water for hours, with no one else around until we were leaving. It was like a hidden paradise.",3.8

I would be concerned about you driving long distances though. 1 group of tourists just got found after a week in the bush, they were very lucky not to have died. There is so much that can go wrong out there, so I would suggest not driving, as you can just catch a flight right to Uluru. Our flies don't really bite..... Unless they are horse flies, which can take a little chunk out of you. If you aren't use to flies, they will drive you crazy. The trick is to just embrace them......

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I know about most of the communities from Cape Leveque to Cairns or Thursday Island. There are a lot of good ones amd a lot of bad. The good have generally banned alcohol. My comment was not about communities though, rather the cities that people think are like Alice. Katherine would be close. I don't believe the marginalised reteric. Marginalised means to be treated as insignificant. I would say that the disadvantaged in Alice have had many opportunities and social help. The only people that treat the kids like they're insignificant are their parents unfortunately. People in Alice Springs on a whole are beautiful, caring, welcoming people. The minority that are causing problems are the ones who cannot function in normal society due to drug addiction and mental illness. They are kicked out of their communities and end up in Alice.",2.4
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is an amazing place to visit, rising, as it does, from the desert floor. To see Uluru with the setting or rising sun on it is a very special experience.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Just come back from Uluru and must do for all. Did Uluru, Kata Tjuta and well as Kings Canyon. If you go, don’t forget to look up tours to Mt Conner. It’s the Fool-Uluru. On private property and limited tours. We stayed at Sails in the Desert. And was a very good spot to be. Also did helicopter ride around Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Well worth the money. To enjoy it all more, make sure you have some fitness as you won’t get into some of the more interesting places otherwise. For those who have mobility issues, you can still do a lot of things but just not the trail walks. People out there are so friendly and helpful. Unless you are really fit, stick to the cooler/winter months. Also the flies will be really bad as well. Fly in and out is the way to go. The airport is not far from Yulara town centre which is where all the accommodation is. From there you are about 20k from Uluru and about 50k from Kata Tjuta.",4.3

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Another component that I think many people who lack local knowledge/experience of the Northern Territory's situation is how distance and isolation slow down + over-cost any response the government can take to achieve some of the constructive responses to problems you have highlighted. This is something that comes up a lot in the GST discussions over at the [Commonwealth Grants Commission](https://www.cgc.gov.au/) ([Indigeneity + distance](https://www.cgc.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-03/NT%20submission%20-%20Tranche%202_2025R.pdf) being factors that massively push up cost of providing government services) and is worth reading if you want to learn more about how hard these problems are to tackle. In 2022, [a third of houses were burned down in Wadeye](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-27/wadeye-port-keats-northern-territory-fighting/101018246) - which uprooted many people who were living there, and lead to the regions they moved to being under increasing stress. In a southern state with a larger population and where a town the size of Wadeye is both more common and typically a lot closer to other towns or cities, that's something you can take action to recover and address more quickly, cheaply and with a lot more trained people ""on-hand"". But for the NT government (which has less resources, funding and simply capable people - given its size), that's so much harder to do. Remote communities in the tropics are resource-stressed for many reasons; and if a major disruption or damage hits one, it can start a line of knock-on domino effects that are tinder to a matchbox. This is especially important because so many of the problems in the NT are intergenerational violence and abuse - and things like[ Covid made that worse](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajs4.183). And to be clear, I'm not saying that this is all covid's fault, or that it's all events like Wadeye's burning houses to blame. Rather, I'm hoping to get across that compared to other parts of Australia (many experiencing problems with youth crime and inter generational poverty!), the NT and places like Alice Springs are uniquely *fragile* to one or two big disruptions starting a snowball of worsening outcomes in those problems, and that's exactly what we have seen. That compounds the fact that the last time we had ""unity"" in attempt to do something (the Intervention), it was ineffective, motivated by [lies](https://newmatilda.com/2017/06/23/bad-aunty-seven-years-how-abc-lateline-sparked-racist-nt-intervention/) and did [real damage](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/148959) to the [*belief* and *trust*](https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/2106156/NT-Intervention-Evaluation-Report-2020.pdf) many people had in the federal government's ability to help. Which leaves us with Alice Springs where it is now: An absolute mess that will require not just money but a united, long-term commitment by government (and specialised resources beyond just money: skilled people, experts, policing and rehabilitation) - which we are unlikely to get. Nobody wants to think further than the next election cycle on this problem, and even if you see a brief moment of unity from state/federal/local governments it comes unstuck just as fast. That kills trust, and without trust in the system, even young kids in communities who might believe they have a future are going to (fairly ask): who's got their back trying to chase it?",3.1

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Walked in the park at 950 AM to make the 10 AM birds of prey show and made it to the entrance of the show at 10:01 Am and they didn't let us or another family in. Super disappointing. The way the times the shows are laid out make no sense ! We were watching the show about the aboriginal history with Jeremy and during his show they start the eagle show so some people left during the show to go to the other . So basically it's impossible to see it all. The coolest part about this park is being able to walk into a Kangaroo enclosure . Oh and we were able to pet a dingo because They happen to be walking them. Other than that it's just ok . Being an animal lover and one that goes to these kinds of things I wasn't impressed at all . we also did the nocturnal tour at night and it was a different experience we enjoyed it . Would recommend that over the actual park .,1.9

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It's a huge red rock in the middle of nowhere that is somewhat majestic with its larger than life size and color. It was raining when we landed. Needless to say not something you appreciate when on vacation. The staff member that met us at the airport was extatic for the rain- so were the locals. Rain is so rare here that very few see it. Apparently the rain forces the bloom of plants that almost never bloom. The coolest thing about the rain as it made it appear the rock was crying. It didn't rain for the remainder of the trip so walking/ hiking around the rock was outstanding. In fact just relaxing and sipping cocktails gazing was quite comforting.,3.4

I stubbed my toe on the rock coming out, hit a buffalo and damaged my bullbar. My front diff fell out caused from the corrugation on the road. Also I had to put down my tyre pressures because it was so bad and my tyre popped. Very disappointed. Under the water the rocks were very slippery and I fell over in the water.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is stunning - you just can't comprehend the vastness of it until you see it in real life. I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity and prevalance of 'greenery' around the rock. The base walk took 3 hours and although the terrain is flat / sandy, it was tough-going - it was very hot by 8.30am! We were keen to climb before the ban on 26th October and are so thrilled we had the chance to do so. Here are our tips: 1. The climb is closed far more than it is open - if the sole or primary purpose of your trip is to climb then keep your plans flexible (sod's law will guarantee that the morning you book a tour or activity will be the one day the climb is open!) and attempt the climb early in your trip. With a lot of luck you may get up on day 1/2, and will then be free to head to (for example) King's Canyon (which is also beautiful). 2. The climb is frequently closed due to weather: usually because the conditions are too hot or too windy. Mornings tend to be cool but windy (winds usually die down as the day goes on) but afternoons are often blisteringly hot with no breeze. 3. The best time to climb (both in terms of your comfort and the likelihood of the climb being open) is 7 - 8am. If the weather is forecast to hit above 36 degrees at *any* point that day, the climb will automatically be shut at 8am for the remainder of the day, and it will not re-open. (This is the case even though it might not be forecast to hit 36 degrees until 3pm). So if you are there well before 8am, the heat won't thwart your climb, but the winds still might. 4.. The climb can also be closed if rain is forecast, or if it has recently rained, or if a storm is predicted. However, these conditions would be unusual in October. 5. The rangers assess the climb conditions at 7am, 8am, 10am, 12 noon, 2pm and 4pm. So if the climb is closed in the morning it may open later, and vice versa. 6. Save the number of the Ayers Rock Resort in your phone, and at around 10 minutes past the relevant hour (see above), call and ask be put through to any of the hotels - they are updated if the climb opens or closes. 7. if you are keen to climb, you must hire a car. You absolutely will need it to make sure you can zoom off to the climb if it opens. If you are stuck on a tour schedule or beholden to the 'hop on hop off bus' (which by the way, is an absolute rip-off, and doesn't get you to Uluru before 8am unless you pay even more for the 'sunrise' bus), you may miss the climb when it's open. I'd take it as far as saying you should call your hotel from the airport tarmac to ascertain the climb status before you waste time going to drop off your cases and change - if it's open it might be your only window. 8. wear proper shoes (hiking / trekking), SPF 50, long sleeves, long comfy trousers (e.g. gym leggings), and wide brimmed hat (must have a chin strap - it's so windy up there). There's a loo and a water point at the Mala car-park - make sure you down a litre or two before heading up and take one with you in your backpack. 9. WEAR A BACKPACK. the climb involves scrambling and 'bouldering' and sliding on your bum a bit and you must keep you hands free to be able to grip the chain or break a fall if need be. 10. We are 31 and 33 and regular gymgoers. We found the climb brisk but manageable. It took us around 2.45hours return trip with 30 minutes or so at the top for photos, but we weren't in a rush so probably could have sped up a bit if need be. Hope this is helpful - we found it so hard to get information on the climb and only learnt the 'rules' about weather and needing to be there before 8am when we got to Uluru.",3.7

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's not like the only thing to do at Uluru is to climb up it, though. You can walk the 10km around the base, learning about the culture as you walk.

The only one of these I haven't done is skydiving, I've done all the rest of these experiences at Uluru. And all of them are fun and exhilarating and rewarding in their own way.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is an experience that should be on every Australians ''Bucket List'. When approaching out of the desert region this monolith seems to take on an ethereal nature. You can understand why the indigenous people of Australia have revered it for in excess of 50,000 years. It is dated back more than 500,000,000 years and it presents today exactly as it did then. There are many sacred sites around the base of Uluru (formerly Ayers Rock) many of which are sacred and unable to be photographed. There were many international tourists there and you can see how popular it has become as an icon of the ''Red Centre'' and Aussie outback. We did an 18 hour coach tour from Alice Springs with ''Emu Run Experience'' tours who really ensured that you never missed a thing there and back.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We went as a family in July to the Alice Springs Desert Park. The park is beautiful and well set out. We went early to catch the first talk on the kangaroos - really recommend if you want to get to it that you are in the park by 8.00 am as it starts at 8.30 and this will give you time to grab tickets, learn about what is on offer in the park, orientate yourself and walk the 10 minutes to the presentation area. Paths are easy to negotiate and are wheelchair friendly. If you choose the self guide tour it is a pleasant walk and there is plenty of information provided in the park.. but I would recommend the ranger/guide talks that are held approx. every hour on habitats, animal species, indigenous foods and medicines and how the indigenous people managed the land and resources. The park is divided into habitats and the nocturnal We have four daughters that range in age from 6-15 years... the younger two did enjoy the talks for a while... but them got a bit restless. Luckily for me, my husband took them back to the hotel for a swim (you can get pass outs for the day) and came back later in the afternoon for the shows/talks that they were more interested in. This left me free to go and enjoy every talk! Jeremy and Matty were great guides and very engaging; and the bird shows (2 per day) were fantastic! Great crowd engagement and amazing to see the wild birds interacting with the free flying Desert Park birds - if just a bit nerve wracking at times - the keepers were amazing with their birds... they are obviously very well loved and well kept. The shows were slightly different in morning and afternoon... so really recommend seeing both. Toilet facilities were very clean and well appointed. There is an onsite café, too. And we really recommend the 20 minute cinema show... the end is AMAZING and left us all gobsmacked and unable to move for five minutes... even the kids!!! We returned that night to attend the nocturnal walk and this was a great experience. The area is fenced and well protected from predators and the walk is gentle with infrared light headbands provided to negotiate paths. You are guaranteed to see at least a few animals on the tour but the variety will vary according as the animals will roam free.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Visited this iconic part of Australia recently and we were in awe of the magnificence of Uluru. It is a truly special place to visit whether you decide to trek around the base or take one of the shorter walks. We chose not to climb Uluru out of respect to the traditional Indigenous owners but found it a compelling place to view. Guided tours are available where you are able to learn more about the Indigenous beliefs and important roles Uluru has played.,4.7
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Even if you were right about there being only superficial differences (and you're not), it's still just showing how little you know. Arnhem land has a population of 16k. However, there are 670k indigenous in Australia. Most indigenous *actually do live in the cities and the towns* of This Fair Land, so they *do have access* to ""white man's law"" as you put it, including, crucially, the woman in the article. Alice Springs, the home of the woman on which the article is based, has [native title claims coexisting with federal claims](https://www.clc.org.au/index.php?/articles/info/the-arrernte-native-title-claim-in-alice-springs/), proving yet again that you don't know what you're talking about when you say ""completely separate from the rest of Australia"".

Please don't scupper their chances of improving their lives by dismissing them on the fantasies in your head.",2.4

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited on Dec 29th - 3 days after the most terrific rain storm, and when the park had been forced to shut - so we didn't know what to expect............ with only 2 days we packed in all we could - including a sunrise tour of Uluru, and a canyon walk in the Olgas and then a sunset tour and a walk to a waterhole, followed by a starlight bbq. It was an anazing day. The desert was green with vegetation and full of wonedrful flowers , thanks to the 20cm of rain. The waterhole was full, there was some standing water and still some water running off the rocks. Our guide Michael was epic and really informative. We had a brilliant (if exhausting) day. Uluru is one of those once in a lfetime visits and experiences that turns out to be even better than you hope. You MUST visit.",4.1
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Totally lived up to all my expectations! If you have a car, suggest that you do sunrise and sunset yourself at the recommended locations and only pay for a separate field of light tour (which you can't do independently).

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A most beautiful magical area. The rocks and soil are orange whilst the vegetation is a gorgeous grey green. The ghost pines add a feeling of an impressionist painting. Dinner under the stars with The Rock in the background was a one off experience, it was followed by sunrise from Kata Tjuta which is the mountain range facing Uluru. A walk up into the gorge was invigorating with the fierce wind being funneled through the narrow gorge. The ""sandblasting"" effect of the wind is obvious in the form of large holes in the rock.",4.6

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Very very impressive. The way they have created the different local landscapes (underground rivers, saltpans and forest) is very informative and as you would expect each of these areas attract their own flora and their own wildlife. There are a number of aviaries and although I am not normally a fan of them but those here are very large and allow the birds a normal life. There is even breeding taking place. The nocturnal house is memorable (and dark, so listening to a young person was helpful); easily the biggest we have ever seen. We greatly enjoyed the bird display which showed indigenous birds in action. The audio guides were helpful and allowed the visitors to wander at their own speed. However mine failed halfway round. Despite pointing this out at the reception it was placed in the same basket as the rest. I'm convinced that someone else would have the same problem on the following day. It is expensive for foreigners with the level of the Australian Dollar but was a wonderful introduction to the flora and fauna of the Red Centre. I could not imagine it being done better.",3.7

The weather was cool and very overcast so we decied to do the base trek. It took us just on 2 hours to do and was worth it! Everytime we looked up at the rock it looked completely different. It did rain on and off but that was a good thing as it cooled us off and kept the flies away. We went back to Uluru the day we flew out as the weather was sunny and fine and gave us a completely different perspective! The atmosphere at Uluru is one I cant describe, its utter remoteness and seclusion coupled with this rock that appears out of nowhere!

The guide who gave a talk on the dingoes there was also very good and happy to answer questions. The flying display was, however, the best part of the whole visit. How they got the birds to turn up and perform as needed was something else and the lady who gave the talk was very entertaining, informative and had a real rapport with the birds.

We went during the wet season, and everything is green and lush, and animals like kangaroos and wallabies are everywhere (and some are tame enough to accept hand feeding - although in generally they bound away if you get too close). We did one walk, which was the South Walk, leading to one of the few places in Nitmiluk still open to swimming - a waterfall plunging into a rock pool with some very inquisitive fish. The park contains several walks of different duration, the longest being about a week, and leading to a remote rock art gallery of the Jawoyn people. Absolutely worth the visit and the sunburn.",3.6

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This review is geared more to foreign visitors and is based on a caravan experience I had back in July, from Alice Springs to Uluru and Kings Canyon. I certainly understand the cultural significance of Uluru to Australians and don't want to take that away from them. But for foreign tourists wanting to visit a desert area on a driving tour, you might be better off going to the US. The rock itself is interesting but for me paled in comparison to the natural wonders of, say, Grand Canyon, Zion, or even Death Valley national parks. Mainly the sheer size of the rock formations in these parks are much more impressive than Uluru, as are the elevation changes, for example from 7000 feet from the rim to 2000 feet at the bottom of the grand canyon, a the canyon being several miles wide in parts. In addition when traveling through the US desert you are crossing a series of mountains and canyons, which provide impressive vistas of the surrounding terrain. The portion of the outback near Uluru, on the other hand, is mostly flattish terrain with heavy brush, so you can't see much from the roadside. Frankly, it's a boring drive from Alice Springs, except maybe the first few times you see a road train passing by. One more thing, US deserts for the most part don't have a lot of insects. In Uluru, at least in the wintertime, there are some nasty flies. Bug nets required. If you decide to go caravaning in the area, check if there are any school holidays, which can increase congestion significantly, and make caravan park reservations harder to get. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my Australian holiday, and definitely liked Cairns and Sidney. I also liked Kings Canyon, which I think is a worthy stop if you are in the area and actually liked better than Uluru. However I'm not sure the driving effort was worth it, overall.",3.3

From Alice Springs via 4wd convoy to Birdsville, then a flight back to Alice Springs. As with the arrival in the Desert Park, and later in the Simpson Desert, at first appearance there seems to be little there. How wrong that first impression is! With knowledgeable people beside you, and your own senses, the desert comes alive. It is such a rewarding experience for your senses - COLOURS and patterns - silence and bird calls - desert dryness and breezes - coolness in the morning, heat in the middle of the day - tough textures of desert plants, delicate and fragile flowers, armoured seed pods, lacy aerial seeds - that heady taste of adventure - the soaring of your soul. The Desert Park features several presentations over the course of the day. Don't miss any of them! From close up encounters with wonderful birds, to bush tucker talks interlaced with aboriginal legends and multi-generational bush lore. Jeremy gave the bush lore presentation. He is like the desert too - at first he seems a quiet and shy man, but watch out for his dry (how apt) sense of humour! It sneaks up on you. Allow the full day is my tip!",4.5

He is an aboriginal man and although his country is in another part of Queensland his connection to the land and deep understanding of the culture and love of sharing it with people made this a precious and meaningful visit to Uluru. He shared many stories and a great deal of knowledge about the importance of the site to the local Ananangu people and showed us beautiful places - including a water hole and lots of caves and rock paintings. The sunrise was gorgeous - just like the postcards. Unfortunately, we were only able to do 3 km of the walk as much of the track was still closed after the flood on 26 December.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The photos you see don’t do it justice versus seeing it up close. There is one section of the rock where photography is not permitted due to tribal religious aspects. The distance around is 7 miles and can take 2-3 hours to walk. Surface is relatively flat with several advantage points to view such as the Mutitjula waterhole. If you don’t do the entire walk, you can probably find a tour that will take you to this area. If you do plan to walk around the entire base, go very early in the morning before the sun gets too intense. Take plenty of water, snacks, sunscreen, and hat, wear good walking shoes and above all fly nets since there are no stores in this area. Tours are offered to view the sunrise and sunset as well. When we were there the weather was not cooperating and the sunrise and sunset views were not that great. However, there was a small break in the cloud cover and when the sun appeared you can see the colors shift on the rock as the sun went down. There were also artists in the area selling their wares when we were there for the sunset viewing. Climbing is no longer permitted. TIP ON FLY’S: Take fly nets and place the fly net over a wide hat so the netting has separation from your face. THE FLY’S ARE EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE AND AWFUL. Someone mentioned that Skin So Soft works and the fly’s stay away. This is not true, even fly repellent did not work. Our tour guide indicated that nothing works, but fly nets make it a bit more tolerable.",2.5

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"At HJUP, we recognize the urgency of these issues and propose a comprehensive 3 Pillar Approach to address and mitigate the situation effectively: Pillar 1: Community Engagement and Empowerment We believe that lasting solutions come from the community itself. Our first step involves enhancing community policing initiatives, increasing engagement between law enforcement and local residents through workshops, town hall meetings, and collaborative planning. Empowering community leaders and groups to take an active role in safety measures can help tailor solutions that are culturally sensitive and locally endorsed. Pillar 2: Education and Prevention Programs Education plays a crucial role in prevention. This pillar focuses on implementing educational programs that promote non-violence, respect, and understanding among community members. We aim to work with schools, local organizations, and experts to develop curricula and community activities that address the root causes of violence, such as social inequality and lack of opportunities. Pillar 3: Strengthening Legal and Support Frameworks Enhancing the legal response to incidents of violence is essential. This involves not only stringent enforcement of laws but also ensuring that those affected have access to necessary support services. This includes legal aid, counseling, and health services that help victims and work towards rehabilitating offenders. Additionally, we'll advocate for more robust funding and support for local law enforcement to ensure they are well-equipped to handle these challenges. By implementing this three-pronged approach, we aim to create a safer, more cohesive environment in Alice Springs. https://preview.redd.it/kxrhgq3h4r2d1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a884037ffe79c3080d34153ec06644ebf9cd9dd",3.9

It got dark and they put these little electric candles on every table (couldn’t see our food without them), but they attracted SO MANY FLYING INSECTS. It was kind of gross, they kept ending up on the plate. Overall, not a good experience. What we DID really enjoy was the bus tour to see the sunrise over Uluru, a beautiful sunrise hike at Kata Tjuta and a nice sunset viewing (we had a rental car and self-drove), and we rented bikes and rode all around the base of Uluru one morning. (It was really hot and we found this a bit more appealing than walking for 2+ hours in the sun. We took frequent breaks and loads of pictures.) We stayed at the Lost Camel and we really enjoyed having the pool - although there is limited shady seats/loungers.

Uluru - Kata Tjuta NP have placed their AED inexplicably over 1km from their Emergency Radio, in a chemical store next to toilets. And what’s worse is the fact that the door is padlocked. I only found out when cleaners allowed me to look for the AED. I added a second photo showing that indeed the grubby box has an AED in it! Before making this review, I had several times explained why this is I appropriate to Parks Rangers. Their response ranged from “What’s an AED?” to “Its their because it may get vandalized”. In January last year I found another AED in the Cultural Centre of the same park behind a locked door. It only got moved after I made a similar review here on Trip Advisor. See my earlier review! You make up your own mind as to the preparedness of the Rangers should a visitor suffer a Cardiac Arrest. 1 Star is one more than they deserve on this issue.",1.8

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"National Geographic assured that there would be considerable flexibility and that it was, in fact, as the name implied, a ""private excursion"". It was not. Neither was it luxurious. The Shangri La Hotels were subpar both in Sydney and in Cairns. Our flight connections were torturous. At one location we had a four-hour layover despite the fact that planes departed for our next destination every two hours.We asked to switch and were told that we held a special low-rate ticket that did not permit changes. We had to wait. Thank-you National Geographic. Yet, the biggest problem was the need to wake and eat on someone else's schedule. Getting up before 6:00 in the morning on a vacation is ridiculous. Yet, travel and tour plans dictated such a schedule. We were told to be ready 15 minutes early, and we were. Then the drivers were late, creating stress and resentment. Furthermore, dinner was generally served too late for me to eat it. I was able to make special arrangements to eat dinner before 7:00, but in doing so, ate alone each night. I incorrectly believed that my access to the wonderful resorts on Kangaroo Island and Lizard Island was dependent upon my booking the trip through National Geographic, an understanding fostered by the literature and conversations I had prior to the trip. Of course, anyone can stay at these resorts. Moreover, the trip to Uluru was a complete waste of time. There is nothing there to see or to do, it is hard to get to, it is hot and full of flies.",1.7

Reddit/AskScienceFiction,Alice Springs Desert Park,"With the much stronger sunlight of Alice Springs, Farken'AwesumBloke is much stronger than that pissweak Superman of Earth-0, his cells having developed to absorb and be a more efficient capacitor of solar energy. With his battle cry of ""Faaarrrk'n'El"", Farken'AwesumBloke is his world's foremost protector, fighting for Mateship, a Fair Go, and the preservation of his Centrelink Payments. Admired and respected by his fellow heroes, he is known for his affable nature, honesty, being a 'top bloke', glorious mullet, racist comments targeted at anyone who isn't an Anglo Australian, and addressing his allies as ""Oi, Cunt!"". Despite often being the first into the fray (particularly if he's been downing tinnies all arvo) he has sometimes failed to answer the call to arms, claiming he's ""..feeling a bit crook, I must've had a bad snag at the barbie yesterday.."", the use of this excuse after public holidays, long weekends or major sporting events leads many of his compatriots to conclude that he is indeed pulling a Super Sickie. Farken'AwesumBloke has actually met Kal-El during the Crisis of Metric Shit-tons of Earths, and found him to be totally up-himself and unable to take a joke. The Crisis was a sad time for Farken'AwesumBloke, as his steadfast ally and good mate, the mighty KiwiBro, hurt his back during battle, and has (claimed) to be unable to work full time since, staying home and collecting a disabilty allowance instead. Maintaining a secret identity in Alice Springs, Farken'AwesumBloke is known to his friends, neighbors and the Alice Springs Police as Gary Graham, a not-mild-mannered-at-all part time diesel mechanic and forklift driver. A well liked fixture at the local TAB, backyard barbies or Lasseters Hotel Casino on Barrett Drive. Gary, or 'Gazza' as he prefers to be known is considered by those who know him to be a good laugh, a good sort (and a 'top root' by his ex-missus).

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru / Kata Tjuta sacred site and national park in the Northern Territory desert of central Australia is an amazing place to visit. Flying into Uluru airport gives great aerial views of both Uluru, Kata Tjuta and the super flat desert which was once an underwater sea bed. Absolutely loved my visit to Uluru. I was there 3 nights, and totally loved the vibe, the desert, the amazing red rock and desert sand against the blue sky was so awesome. A must do if coming to Australia. The Hotel site is at Yulara Voyagers Ayers Rock Resort and there are a number of hotels there at different star rating levels, cabins and a camping site. There is a supermarket in the Town Square where you can buy supplies and do some shopping for unique artwork and items. From the Hotels there is a Hop on Hop off bus services which takes you at set times out to Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Hiring a car gives you best flexibility. You will need to buy a National Parks pass which you will need to show when entering the Uluru site, you can easily buy it online and download the pass onto your phone. The bus ride from the Hotel to Uluru took about 30mins and has a number of pick up bus stops on the way. The bus ride to Kata Tjuta is about 40mins, it is further away from the Hotel in the opposite direction to Uluru. Uluru is a 10km walk around the base, and walking or bike riding it (you can book onto the cycling tour to access a bike) are the up close to the rock options. Driving around the Rock you aren't as close but is still a good option, particularly if you aren't very mobile, you will still get a great experience. They say it takes 3-3.5 hours to walk the 10kms, I feel this is a very ambitious timing. To get the most out of being there doing a slower walk and having time to just sit and feel the amazing ambience there is a must. You'll need to make sure you time your walk to meet the bus to return to the Hotel. Kata Tjuta has 2 walks - 1 hour and 3 hours. This sacred site is completely different to Uluru. Uluru is one huge monolith rock, whereas Kata Tjuta is multitudes of big round boulders and sheer rock faces in a clump. This vibes there are amazing. The short walk is up a Gorge, really fantastic. The 3 hour walk is a marked path winding through the boulders. It is very serene and interesting. Doing the Sunrise and Sunset visits to the viewing platforms is a must. Absolutely stunning. Amazing photos you can take! There are quite a few spots you are forbidden to photograph at Uluru, these are the aboriginal people's most sacred places and the park rangers enforce the no photography rule. This is a sacred site so no taking anything from there or leaving anything there, if you tune in you can feel the high vibes. Temperatures in the desert can get to 45+ degrees celsius in the summer months Nov-March and the walks around Uluru are closed by park rangers once temperatures reach 39 degrees celsius. Best to go there on the first bus, early in the morning and do all your walking before midday. Visiting April to October the temperatures are much lower so all day walking may be possible which is why it is the peak visiting season then. Nights are cold during the winter and warm in the summer. I did the Sounds of Silence desert dinner and it was fantastic. They do their best to accomodate dietary needs (let them know in advance what you need). There's a great astronomy talk, a didjeridoo performance, you are seated at tables of 10 and the dinner is buffet style so you can choose what you want to eat yourself. A fabulous experience. I used the hop on hop off bus tickets and found that easy and the bus is an airconditioned coach, very comfortable. Bring your own water bottles, you can refill them yourself the tap water is fine to drink. I took 2 water bottles as it was super hot 41 degrees celsius each day, in mid-march. That worked really well. I also took a fly net to cover my face, and long sleeves top and pants and wide brimmed hat for sun protection. You really need good sun protection as you can fry & dehydrate out there. Visit the Ayers Rock Resort website to see all the activities.",4.6

Beautiful place and only after descending did we notice the croc cage and pictures of the salties caught there before. I hope mainly in the wet season because they looked really mean.,3.9

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert park is the best way to see all the animals that are so good at hiding in the wild. It has the most amazing nocturnal house. The bird show is very popular and for good reason. They also have an aquarium which was a great surprise to us and lots of walk in aviaries. It really is a great opportunity to learn what birds and small animals you only catch a glimpse of in the wild. A word of warning. If you have a child that is of high school age then you will need to show their school ID or they will charge you the full entry price. The lady who served us was very harsh ,bordering on rude. It seemed fairly obvious to me that our daughter is not an adult but there was no student price without proof. Other staff in the park were very nice so it is strange that they put the most unfriendly staff member to greet people entering. We were planning to have a coffee there but the cafe closes fairly early.",3.9

The setting at the foot of the Macdonnell Range is stunning and there is no feeling that the various habitats you wander through are in any way artificially created. Particularly impressed by the Indigenous culture presentation, the bird show (fantastic!), the nocturnal house (the thorny devil licking up ants was a highlight, but some of the creatures were either absent or not visible) and the many aviaries. Very surprised at the numbers of birds both inside the walk-through enclosures and flying wild in the the park. Staff were knowledgeable, helpful and friendly, and the audio guide very informative. Suggest wearing closed shoes, as not all paths are sealed. Only (very slight) criticism is of the wedge tail encounter, which turned out to be a rather pricey photo opportunity, and although you do get stand close to the bird, the pics taken for us were disappointing. Overall - highly recommended, a visit certainly makes you look for and see more in the desert.",4.1

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,I've only ever been once. Was travelling around Australia with mates and stopped in at Alice Springs. There was a burnt out van directly out the front of the hostel/backpackers. We walked to a bottle shop at about 8-9pm through a open mall type thing and there were a group of kids there who immediately hurled abuse. First time i've been called a white cunt. Luckily we're all fairly large guys and don't look like a easy target. Also got hassled out for food at the KFC when leaving the next day. Can't say it felt particularly safe.,2.8

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Did the Ormiston Pound Walk with my Wife and two children (11,13) two days ago. We headed off in the recommended anti-clockwise direction at about 7.00am. We had a very leisurely stroll. Stopped numerous times to take shoes off and wade through water and for other breaks. Walked to the lookout off the track at about the half way mark and it was well worth the small detour as the views were outstanding. Stopped next to a flowing creek for morning tea which was great. Towards the end of the walk we had to wade through quite a bit of water but the sandbanks made it easy. There was a stretch of about 5-10 metres that we had to swim through so take that into consideration and don't drown your camera like I did. We completed the walk by midday but as stated it was very leisurely. My Wife is not very fit but she still completed the walk easily, as did my children. The walk would take a lot less time without as much water around but that made it nice in other ways. There were also a great variety of wild flowers around which was nice. I would highly recommend this walk especially if you do not have the time to do any of the more scenic sections of the Larapinta Trail. I have completed the entire trail and if you are thinking of doing it then this would probably be a good intro.",4.2

Its incomprehensibly big and I was overawed by the size of it as we approached in the tour bus. I didn't realise how big it was. I didn't climb out of respect for the requests by the Traditional Custodians but walked (or cycled? Can't quite remember) around the base and it was amazing. It's like 8kms in circumference. The tour visited at sunrise and sunset too and it looks completely at different times of the day. Totally recommend but I imagine you'd also want to do other things in the area too as Uluru itself is probably just a full day activity kind of thing.",3.7

More than 35 have died attempting that feat. We could have dome the 10 km walk around the base but we opted to do the drive. We stopped at several spots for closer look of the waterhole and walking track signs. Not too crowded and could avoid the couple of tour busses. Visited the cultural centre and cafe. Prices were as expected at such a remote place, everything does have to be brought in after all. Also drove over to the Olgas, Kata Tjuta but after midday and as the cloud cover had gone the temperature was climbing to 36C so no walking here for us.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We spent several hours exploring this park on a beautiful Sunday morning. Critical to this 4 star review was the Bird Show which is only on twice a day (morning and afternoon) – without that show this would be a 3 star review, so be sure to organise your visit to coincide with that show. The park itself is located 10-15 minutes outside town at the base of a dramatic mountain range. Set-up in roughly a large circle, you walk through the park exploring the different animal enclosures and changes in landscape. The park is very clean and well designed – you can’t see the different structures until you are at them, with landscaping hiding things away and maintaining a feeling of exploration. While you will see all the usual Australian animals, bird lovers are in for a real treat. There are 5-6 different enclosures full of birds. The bird show I mentioned above is also extremely well done. The birds (and handlers) are very well trained with lots of close encounters and opportunities to learn about and observe a wide range of birds. The show goes for about 30-40 minutes and the kids (and adults) loved it . There is also a movie presentation which we didn’t get to and plenty of guided talks and walks. We spent two hours exploring the park but you could easily spend 3-4 if you did a couple of the talks and the movie.",4.0
Reddit/darwin,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"The 250km a day thing is annoying though over 7 days and a careful itinerary you will manage - Darwin to Litchfield to Mataranka to Ubirr to Darwin is around 1300km and 7 days gives you 1750 so plenty for detours. And you don't need to go all the way to Mataranka (though it is worth it). If Mataranka is too far, then I think you should still do Nitmiluk - it's a bit of a triangle between Darwin, Katherine and Jabiru so it makes sense. Edith Falls is worth a look, too. I have actually never done any of the Kakadu sites that need a 4WD but hear they are impressive - but you'll get a great taste with Cooinda, Nourlangie, Ubirr and if you are keen to see, say Jim Jim or Twin Falls you could check out a tour from Jabiru. That would likely be cheaper than a 4WD hire for the whole week. Another good option is a scenic flight over Kakadu. But a 2WD trip will be good.",3.0

Added to that is the fact that Uluru is kind of the only appealing feature of that holiday. I have no desire to visit Alice Springs or the outback. Petrol, food, flights, accommodation are all prohibitively expensive and you’d have to be living under a rock (pun intended) to not know about the crime problems in Alice and surrounding areas. If it’s a sacred site and people who don’t share those beliefs or belong to that community aren’t meant to go there, then I’ll treat that with the same respect I’d treat an Islamic or Christian or Jewish sacred site, eg I won’t go there.

We were dropped at the waterhole and there was no one, a nice feeling of adventure even though it was on a path, we walked to the Kanju gorge and did not see anyone (as if the mountain was ours for 1.5 hrs). We would highly recommend it but bring enough water, it was indeed hot and they closed the path from the waterhole to the main entrance where the climb starts due to extreme temperatures (it seemed like overkill as we found it much hotter at places that were open...). Anyway, as long as you can get away from big tours and crowds, its amazing. The sunrise is quite crowded so try to walk around to a spot where there are not people in front of you.",4.7

We like to 'potter around' on our own but a guided tour is possibly a good idea for some. Many many photos were taken !! Recommend. Absolutely.",4.3

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Based purely on the name without having done research (""Springs"") you could imagine if formed around an oasis in the desert that people needed to stop at when going cross country. Tbh though man this is an easy chatGPT question: ChatGPT response: Alice Springs exists mainly because it became an important stopover and service point in the middle of Australia — basically halfway between Adelaide and Darwin — for both communication and transportation. Here’s how it happened: * **Telegraph Line**: In the 1870s, the Australian Overland Telegraph Line was built to connect Australia to the rest of the world via undersea cable from Darwin. They needed repeater stations every few hundred kilometers, and Alice Springs (then known as Stuart) was chosen as one because it had a semi-reliable water source nearby (the Todd River and a waterhole called ""Alice Spring""). * **Cattle and Exploration**: Around the same time, pastoralists (cattle ranchers) started moving into Central Australia. Alice Springs became a base for them because it was one of the few places with access to water and supplies. * **Railway**: Later on, it also became a stop on the Central Australia Railway (the old ""Ghan""), which made it even more important for trade and travel across the continent. * **Military**: During World War II, the town exploded in size because it was a major staging area for troops moving to northern Australia. So basically, Alice Springs is there because of **communication needs**, **cattle**, **transport**, and **war** — all in the middle of a desert!",3.1

There was a distant thunderstorm through the night, then in the morning I was woken up by a huge flock of galahs. Great place - would recommend a stopover. Obviously if you already have bookings then a night may not be an option, but just something to consider. They used to serve camel burgers then too - don't know if they still do - presumably made from their own camels. The way we did it was we spent the night at Erldunda Roadhouse, then ""commuted"" to Yulara early morning for our walk around Uluru, then went to Kings Creek Station for the night. No nights in Yulara due to prices being too high for our taste. What's a 250 km commute in the Outback between friends ;) If you're planning to do the walk, make sure you start early. We started early enough that it felt cool, but by the time we were done we realised we didn't bring quite enough water and I got a pretty nasty headache. It got hot surprisingly fast.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"""Uluru"" was under my bucket list since 2015 and it literally gave me chills when I witnessed this massive humongous red rock which is certainly one of the preeminent wonder of nature. Its being said the best time to visit Northern Territory is between May-Aug,so I planned my long pending Outback trip this Aug end .The temperature was pretty decent during day time(18-25 degrees) but at night the temperature was around 3-6 degrees ,so would recommend to take warm clothes with you if you are planning to camp or sleeping under stars in swags during winter. Upon our arrival at Ayer's rock airport around 12:30 PM, we were picked up by our tour (Mulgas Adventure Tours) and reached Kata Tjuta National park in 35 mins (distance from Airport to National park is 30 kms).Post paying the entry fees for National park (25$ per person) ,we arrived the car park from where we started the Uluru base walk. The perimeter of Uluru base is approximately 10.6km ,it takes approximately 3.5 hours to complete. We reached the Kuniya car park around 3:30 PM ,since we had to witness the sun set (6:30 pm) so we started the base walk from Kuniya car park and finished at the car park near uluru climb, took us approximately 2 hours in total. There are couple of places as ""sensitive sites"" so photography is not allowed there.The use of drone is also prohibited at Uluru. In case if you don't want to get lost while base walking just make sure ""The rock is always on your right hand side"" so that it can be ensured you are moving in one direction. The base walk was absolutely mesmerizing ,the texture of the rock is different from various angles and also the color varies depending upon the Sun light.There are many aboriginals stories like Kuniya-Liru and Lungkata which are associated with the rock and the walks are named after them .There are several places on the rock which hold the significance to these stories and can be spotted while walking. The base walk is suitable for all age group,be in comfortable walking shoes ,wear hat/cap and shades.Would recommend to carry water. One toilet place is approximately 200 meters away from the carpark which is near the climb point (although the uluru climb was open ,we opted not to climb as its considered as the sacred place for aboriginals,so please dont climb and be respectful,also from Oct 2018 its going to be officially prohibited).

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We hired a car at the resort and used this to visit Uluru each day of our visit, which was a good option for a family. Uluru was amazing, definitely living up to expectations. Walking tracks are well maintained and with informative signposting. Ranger walks are offered free each day but can be overcrowded and a little slow-moving, especially for kids. Even though we visited in September, daily temperatures were already over 30C every day, so early morning or late afternoon trips worked best for us to avoid the heat. There is a spiritual quality at Uluru for those who take the time to appreciate it. Surprisingly, many tourists are still climbing the rock each day. Out of respect, and for safety, we chose not to. A sunset viewing is highly recommended, but get to the designated viewing area early to secure a spot. An imposing and impressive monolith definitely worth visiting.",4.3

It’s size is hard to grasp and the feeling when you’re there makes you quiet. You feel strange talking and filling that silence. Be respectful of where you are and enjoy the surroundings. It is important to watch out for the temperatures as the heat is unfriendly and almost impossible to stay hydrated. Take a hut and definitely sunscreen.

The Uluru Statement is literally a real physical signed document, like the Declaration of Independence. There are [photographs](https://anglicanfocus.org.au/2022/10/19/uluru-statement-canvas-delights-cathedral-peace-day-attendees/) of it. Find me a photograph that shows all so-called ""26 pages"". It doesn't exist. The only thing that was signed was 1 page. If you can't find a photograph of the original signed 26 page document, then you lose the argument. 2. People should go read the other so-called 25 pages ""Our Story"". Here's what say on page 18. > A number of Dialogues considered ways that political representation could be achieved ***other than through the proposed constitutional Voice***. These included through the designation of seats in Parliament for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples (although there was some concern that these politicians would be bound by party politics) So if this is the Uluru Statement, does the Uluru Statement call for a Voice or does it called for mechanisms OTHER than a Voice? Which is it? Listing all the random things different people say in meetings, often contradictory because different people say different things, is not a ""statement"" of any sort. >statement > >/ˈsteɪtm(ə)nt/ > >noun >noun: statement; plural noun: statements >1. a **definite or clear expression** of something in speech or writing. > > ""do you agree with this statement?"" There ain't nothing definitive or clear about that 26 page supplement. Anything who thinks this matches the dictionary definition a ""statement"" is a moron. 3. Go to the earliest archived version of the Uluru Statement website: https://web.archive.org/web/20191222222830/https://ulurustatement.org/the-statement It's 1 page, and Our Story is a separate section (like on the current website).

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The bird show (free flight) is well worth scheduling into your visit. If it looks like you are wandering around a desert...you are so you might prepare children for that rather than a zoo as such. The Nocturnal exhibit was very good and quite extensive...and a good respite from the heat. The park has done well to offer a lot of shady stops along the way as well as frequent water stops...but it is still very open so I would suggest earlier or later in the day for comfort.,3.9
TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We found our 4 day tour in Nitmiluk excellent. Our accommodation was a brand new cabin in the camp site with our own bathroom and kitchen. The wallabies came very close and colourful birds flew around. The first day, we had a dinner cruise on the Kathering Gorge with very good food and wine and of course some of the best rugged scenery in the world. The second day we were given our own vehicle and sent off with a very large picnic lunch to do the local sites, which we found interesting. People were friendly and helpful around this area. The third day was a highlight as we were taken out to an Aboriginal community in Mayallaluk, where we learned about finding bush food, flax weaving, rock art, ate kangaroo tail, watched a fire being made from sticks and learned to throw spears. On the last day, we could choose between canoeing or bush walking. The staff at Nitmiluk Visitors centre were very helpful and bent over backwards to see to our every need. The chef was great. In all, we thoroughly recommend this 4 day trip for anybody. It is different and interesting and not as expensive as other tours around Darwin.",4.8

Reddit/darwin,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"I’d suggest hiring a car; I think just about everywhere will offer several days rental and it would make Darwin A LOT easier to get around. Litchfield is a hour out of Darwin but Adelaide River is worth a look as well, so a day trip would cover both. Bring your bathers, pack some water (about five litres for two people), grab some cheese and bacon rolls from Colesworth to snack on. Everywhere that requires a 4WD says so and a 2WD is absolutely fine for 90% or the park. Kakadu is three hours away from Darwin and parts of it are best in the morning so I’d suggest a tour and/or accommodation for that. Nitmiluk Gorge is three hours from Darwin and Jabiru and is worth visiting. Territory Wildlife Park and Berry Springs are a full-ish day and you’ll be back in the city for dinner.

I was lucky enough to visit in 2004 and there seem to be lots more restrictions in 2016 than existed in 2004, eg the base walk in parts is hundreds of metres from the rock whereas in 2004 you could pretty well follow the true base so today you miss on some amazing sights.

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Did the southern walks today, left from the boat ramp car park, walked the look out overlooking the boat area and seeing the 17mile creek on the other side. I found out you should start from the day visitor area so the maps make sense. I found looking at the maps like looking at scrambled eggs, they are a mixture of bike tracks walking tracks all mixed together making no sense, the bike tracks are blue looking like a river. If I had taken time to download the app it would have been easier. The tracks are indigenous names so it makes it even harder to work out for most people. Did the southern rockhole and pats look out, it’s about 800m down stairs and lots of rock climbing to get to the bottom and takes it out of you in the heat, passed a big rock pool near the bottom then to the river with a nice sand bank and trees, well worth the effort but you can’t swim hear. Walked to Jeddas rock then to butterfly gorge, it’s only about 1.5 klms in but seems take for ever, nice and cool near the bottom. Had a refreshing swim for 20 minutes sharing with a handful of other walkers. After a long hot walk it really helped to cool off for the march out to the car. It was a good walk but don’t like walking on wide road tracks on the way out maybe 6klm or more, it was a lot of walking near the road back to the boat ramp car park. The butterfly walk area plus a swim in the gorge was really the best part, maybe take a noodle or blow up float for a bit of extra safety in the water",3.6

Weather permitting (i.e. not too hot) I would recommend do the 8am ranger walk, followed by a coffee/snack at the cultural centre, then get the 10-10.30 bike slot and ride around the whole rock. I've walked it in the past, bike was much more fun. On this occasion it was blisteringly hot, so we did the 7.30 bike circuit only.

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"she ain't local brah [No paywall](https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/04/14/jacinta-price-peter-dutton-alice-springs-locals/) Price told reporters at a press conference in Alice Springs that although locals love their community, they do not feel safe and that the town therefore qualifies as a “failed state”. “Us locals are here for a reason. We love this community, we love the landscape, we love the people in our hometown,” the senator said before calling upon territory and federal government to “listen to the locals” and recognise “needs are not being met”. Price, a former Alice Springs councillor and deputy mayor, is a Warlpiri/Celtic woman from Yuendumu country, about 290km northwest of Alice Springs. Smith says this gives her no right to be talking for or about the Arrernte people of Mparntwe, Alice Springs. “She’s not Arrernte, she’s not from Alice Springs. She’s from Yuendumu. She’s a Warlpiri woman getting on TV discrediting the Arrernte country of Alice Springs. We do not like that,” he said, adding that this is why they want an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. “We don’t want to be the Voice in Canberra, like Jacinta wants to be. We want a Voice in Canberra and they’re distinctly different things. Jacinta does not represent us.” Price was elected senator for the Northern Territory in 2022 following an unsuccessful bid at the federal seat of Lingiari in 2019. Following the resignation of former opposition minister for Indigenous affairs Julian Leeser, speculation from conservative ranks has swirled about Price joining the Liberal Party and assuming the role. Price has taken a strong stance on a No vote for a Voice, maintaining that Canberra chat is detracting from real issues on the ground. When pressed for detail on how better to draw on regional and local voices on Radio National this week, Price said, “I’m providing my perspective as somebody who comes from Alice Springs, as somebody who comes from those areas …” Asked for more detail, Price said, “The detail is about empowering regional voices … drawing from the structures that already exist. People in regional and remote Australia have hardly had the opportunity to effectively be listened to … maybe it’s because of language barriers.”",2.2

Below we have published a photograph claimed to be that of a “flying saucer.” With the picture, the following note was pushed under the door of the “Advocate” office. ‘For several reasons, one of which is because I can hardly believe it myself I refuse at this stage to come forward and allow my name to be used. But study this picture of a flying saucer yourself. ‘I was taking a picture of Mount Gillen on the day that a number of Alice Springs people said they heard something strange pass over the town (Friday January 15). Suddenly an enormous round looking object appeared from behind Gillen. It went high then dropped to come down quite between the mountain and the town - it was not travelling fast at this stage - in fact it appeared to be almost hovering. That was when I took this picture - almost automatically. I focused and clicked the camera. It would have been possible to take more shots but I just looked, then suddenly the thing moved off very fast - it gained speed until it must have been travelling at terrific pace going high to the west. ‘I did not hear much of a whistling sound. The saucer looked to have been anything up to 150 feet across - I don’t know, maybe Adamski had something about those men from Venus.’ The only comment that the “Advocate” is prepared to make at this stage is that the picture could easily be a fake - on the other hand it one would have to go to considerable trouble to make it up.

All hotels here are run by Accor and what a wonderful job the do by providing 3 to 5 star accommodation, training for the youth of Australia (1200+ staff are working out here) and in conjunction with tour operators some of the most wonderful trips and dinner experiences. We joined into the Festival of Lights Dinner and this is World class. What an experience. An amazing part of all this infrastructure is that you still feel (and you are) that you are in a small country town with every convenience. All people we met are relaxed and happy and every where we went whether by tour or in the hire car, it was great to experience the Centre of Australia and all it has to offer. Even down to a very simple (and free) experience is to walk over to the Imalung lookout - all a 5 min walk from your accommodation - while still dark to see the stars give way to a dawn including Uluru views/colours, a 360 degree view, a young dingo pup who visited each morning and all the people from all over Australia and the World to experience this event together. From having a cuppa at dawn next to the rock or watching sunset from a viewing platform between Uluru and Kata Tjuta, driving down Lasseters Way to the Mt. Connor viewing platform or just simply seeing the small birds in the town square at dawn on the native bushes, this is a relaxing enjoyable event.

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"It was a fairly long drive into Gunlom. Unhooked the caravan at a free camp just down the road and drive in on the dusty and corrugated road. (Not as bad as some) After the toughest climb I've done in a while I reached the top (I had been soooooo excited to see this place and wanted my photo on the edge of the infinity pool. I found the waterfall barely flowing and the water was green and not very inviting. I looked down on the bottom pool which was green also, do after the climb down I decided to move on without going there for a swim. Maybe we left it a bit too late after the wet, but then all other places we visited had beautiful clear water. Not sure what to make of this place.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I had read, and been told, that if we didn't have time for many attractions in the Alice, we must choose the Desert Park. On Larapinta Drive 8 km west of town, this outdoor natural history museum nestles at the foot of the MacDonnell Ranges, which provide a dramatic backdrop. The Park is divided into three sections – Woodland, Sand Country, and Desert Rivers – and you can follow a trail that takes in all three. You'll come across the most wonderful walk-through aviaries and a large Nocturnal House, which is so dark it's tricky to spot some of its less active inhabitants! As you walk the walk you'll come across emus and roos and dingos, and there is a variety of presentations and guided 'discovery' walks to choose from. I'd also been advised that, from a varied range of activities, I absolutely must watch the free-flying bird show. Thank goodness we got there in time for the afternoon session in the Nature Theatre. (The two shows daily are at 10 am and 3.30 pm.) All the 'acts' were extraordinary, but two of them in particular were outstanding, and I will never forget them. I'm not going to spoil their impact by describing them in detail: just make sure you don't miss this, especially if you love birds. In the aviaries we saw and heard a huge variety of birds native to the Northern Territory, and in each of the three areas of the Park habitats are effectively recreated. So, for example, there's a dry channel in the Desert Rivers section. Three hours was not enough for us, not to really do justice to all there is on offer. Half a day minimum I would recommend.",4.0
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We raced to the park excited for the bird show arriving 15 before only to be turned away and told to come back for the 3.30 show. We went round the park and enjoyed the talk by Doug about Aboriginal culture- so passionate! We then tried to kill time by having lunch at the cafe. Big thumbs down 👎. Stale sandwiches, no hot food and limited selection even though park was very busy. Finally lined up and waited for 30 min for bird show(our main reason for going to the park) One magpie, a curlew and a brief glimpse of a buzzard who then went wayward, the show ended abruptly and we had to leave. How can the park have such a good reputation but employ incompetent people ( except for Doug) couldn’t get our money back. When you travel from other side of Australia you can’t just come back on a better day.",1.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I've always wanted to see this since as long as I can remember. I took my husband and 2 boys (3 & 5). I was actually excited, it's a place that is so calm, relaxed and at the time there were hardly any people there around 2:30pm. We only did a small walk with young kids. However, we could have spent the day there. So many stories along the trails and is well looked after. It does cost $ 39 per adult to get into the park, I do suggest booking online, plus you will need a Parks pass, which is about $10 per adult. The colour is stunning, the surrounds are fantastic. Only downer us that if you wish to get a souvenir, they are only open 10-2pm. There is beautiful aboriginal art galleries close by aswell, these do come with a hefty price tag. We will return again, definitely something I won't be doing just once! Approx 5 and a half hours from Alice Springs.",3.9

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"First things first. I don’t believe there was a “perfect” spot to see Uluru from as each angle shows something new and unexpected! We saw it from the sky, sunrise and sunset, biked around it and even climbed to the top and all provided a unique experience and prospective. Based on what we saw I would highly recommend planning on an early morning and sunset activity as many of the areas were shut down after 11 due to heat. We spent 3 days exploring and thought it was about right for us. Biggest tip I can give anyone is to make sure you bring fly netting for your face. If you don’t you will be either swatting flies the whole time or buying netting at one of the local stores. Doesn’t look the greatest but works well!",4.4

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,It has to be said that this rock is a pretty unique looking thing. And the fact that it seems mostly surrounded by not much else at all makes it all the more striking. The sheer size of it really hits you as you approach. Even having seen it in my youth it did impress me all over again and the rich colouring was great to look at and to observe at sunset. Now obviously the area can be very hot so you have to use your head and plan your trip time. And take a fly/bug net and a hat and carry your own supply of water if you plan on walking about. Be aware that the sunset viewing area can get busy - as can the sunrise viewing area logically enough. There are not a lot of amenities there but that isn't such a drastic issue - a trip to the cultural centre should also be part of your visit. The downside is the time taken to get there. There are a few other points of interest such as Kings Canyon but otherwise the surrounding terrain is fairly uninspiring. And if you're on a driving holiday then you really will be sick of the scrubby brush and rocky terrain after the first few hundred kilometres. There are a range of places to stay nearby but make sure you book ahead as the places can fill up. Thankfully they are a short drive away so the view of the rock isn't messed up by nearby tourist eyesores and the developments have been kept low-rise. My suggestion would be to check it out in the morning - perfect way to avoid the head. And if you plan on walking or cycling around it do so then. And then pop back out again in the evening for a sunset viewing.,3.4

There is wading at the end, though slightly anticlimatic compared to the warnings as the river was warm and - at the time I visited - only came up to thigh height, but I guess it depends on the time of year.

Real hard to explain to somebody if they haven’t been there or walked around it. There’s a reason hundreds of people from around the globe post back the “souvenir” rocks they stole from that place each year. The place has some legit juju happening and it can be physically felt. If anybody is planning to go there soon-ish I highly recommend the sounds of silence dinner + the field of light art show.

Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Replying to both of your comments here. >Then we should open up all cathedrals, synagogues, mosques, temples and war memorials to climbers. When I was talking with a friend about this they brought up the same point, but I don't think it's quite comparable for logistical reasons: Cathedrals, Synagogues, mosques, etc tend to be in urban spaces where there's active infanstructure and people moving about, there's a much greater safety concern issue and it'd be generally disruptive to society as a whole. Now, if there was, say, a church built into the side of a mountain which was still used or was viewed as sacred due to some miracle said to have happened there historically; and people were denied access to mountain climb on it as a result, even if there wasn't a particularly large safety risk or risk of damage to the church itself; purely on religious respect grounds, then yes, i'd also say that's equally BS. I'm jewish, but I wouldn't demand that people not take selfies at the Wailing Wall or hell, even Auschwitz. Respect, religious value, etc are subjective things, they should not be something legislateed >If you want to explore Conner it's only possible on a private tour, because it's private property. White man's property, part of the Curtin Springs station. So how about we order the owners of Curtin Springs to get off their high horse and open Mount Conner to all comers? It's probably a much safer rock to climb, being nice and flat on top. I'm not disputing the indigenous people's claim to their land and the site, I think it's reasonable for them to have it (for the most part). My issue is their rationale: That because it's sacred to them, other people should be be beholden to their belief system, and not have access to it when there would otherwise not be a problem. I'm less saying I don't think they should be able to do it, and more that I just personally disagree with their decision, though I'd also argue that even if it's their territory, perhaps they still shouldn't be able to do it: I don't think goverments should have the ability to make policy descisions or regulations on the basis of religion, and indigenous nations or states shouldn't be immune to that. Again, you probably wouldn't defend a rule or law of theirs that gives women less rights, if such a rule existed, right? Also, something i'm a bit unclear on, and perhaps you can inform me of this, is of if uluru is still used by the indigious people for religious ceremonies: If it is, and *they* can climb it, then that's discrimination, full stop.",2.7

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"This was a lovely place. The campsite there includes toilets and showers and it is a lovely stay, with the night stars being incredibly bright. The waterfall wasn't running much when we were there bit would be lovely after rain. The lower plunge pool would normally be a lovely swim but when we were there a crocodile had been spotted that morning so no swimming allowed. The climb to the upper lookout and plunge pool was steep and not for the faint hearted...we didn't attempt it. The main issue with Gunlom was the road access. The road was badly corrugated and quite rough in places. While listed as accessible by 2WD I would not do it - some parts would easily trash a normal vehicle's suspension. The road is on bad need of a grader and drivers need to act a little more responsibly by driving slower to reduce the corrugations forming. A pleasant stay but 4WD recommended only.",3.3

Reddit/OldPhotosInRealLife,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Overland Telegraph Station was established in 1872. This photo was taken Around 1900. More like 1901 perhaps, as the Federation drought is setting in. The drought didn't break till 1903. This has all the look and feel of a classic Thomas Bradshaw picture. Bradshaw was Stationmaster here from 1899 to 1908. Mail came from Adelaide, 1000 miles to the South. Roughly 600 miles by train and the last 400 miles 2 or 3 weeks by camel or coach. Coach more often than not being an open wagon. The mail was by camel for much of the time. They could only use horses when there wasn't a drought, because of a lack of reliable wells, and there were many droughts through to 1929 when the train line was finally completed... It was around 1898 that the mail service had improved somewhat, from a six weekly service to a monthly one, and according to Stuart Traynor's notes (history guru).. Frank Gillen wrote his mate Spencer on 3 April 1898 with ‘The mail leaves here tomorrow for the first time under the fortnightly new contract. Coaches are to leave here and Oodnadatta simultaneously, meet at Horseshoe Bend, exchange mails and return to their respective starting points. The previous Stationmaster from 1891-1899 Frank Gillen wrote “Wells has, I am glad to say, sublet this end of the contract to a good man so that we have a chance of getting our mails regularly – We shall receive replies to our letters monthly” - (My Dear Spencer pp. 211-212) The mail coach was a high-seated open buggy, not a stagecoach of the type used by Cobb & Co. Stagecoaches operated in outback Queensland but never on the Oodnadatta track. The four-weekly mail service between Alice Springs and Arltunga, the gold mining area East of Alice increased to fortnightly in 1899. Around this time there were about 300 white people at Arltunga and only a couple of dozen at Alice Springs. Alice Springs white population only got to 90 by the time the railway got here in 1929. Meanwhile, around 5500 Aboriginal people lived in the area [House Elf Adventures](https://www.facebook.com/Lifeupgrade2.0?mibextid=LQQJ4d)",3.3

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I finally had an opportunity to visit Uluru and didn't know what to expect apart from seeing a giant red rock. The first night I viewed the rock from a distance at sunset from the Field of Light viewing platform and witnessed the magnificent changing colours followed by seeing a sky full of stars. Nothing prepares you for seeing it up close. I travelled out to the rock by bus for the base walk. It was hard to find information with clear travel and entry details but I discovered there is a tour bus out from the resort(Uluru Hop on Hop Off , not the free resort shuttle which people assume would go there) with a few options such as one single return trip($49 pp) and importantly a parks Australia entry ticket must be obtained , not included in the bus fare. These are $25pp for three days access. I was able to purchase online and print in advance. (Phone storage okay too) The one day bus ticket will also take you to Kata Tjuta but it soon became apparent that Kata Tjuta could not really be fitted into one day and not every departure goes to both places. The rock is about 20 kms away from the resort and Kata Tjuta about 50 so unless you have a car the only option is the tour bus. The hop on hop off bus requires a pick up time choice on booking , and they ask you to nominate which return bus you will be on at departure.- hard when you have no idea what is out there. There needs to be more frequent runs as the hop on hop off concept was not working with many people wanting to return at the same time and no room and if you miss the bus there is a very long 1.5 hr wait for the next. This is also a problem at the base drop points for people who don't want to walk all the way. The bus drops people at several stops around the base which enables choice of how far you will walk if you do not want to do the entire base, or if you don't walk at all but just see it at one stop. I walked the section between Kuniya Piti to Kantju Gorge /Mala carpark and then the Liru walk to the cultural centre and picked up the bus back from there. There are some maps of the walks with distances online or parks Australia website. This section seems to have the most to see and allows you to be right at the rock. Part of the walk in other sections has the path further away from the rock. My perception of the rock changed as soon as I got off the bus and approached the walk. It is impossible to describe the beauty and intensity of the colours and the majesty of the rock. I had no idea of the vegetation around the base and the presence of caves, waterholes and formations by erosion. It was easy walk around the flat base although it is sandy so some sore muscles the next day. We passed several families pushing bikes as they could not ride easily in parts. Wear sunscreen and take water as there is several kilometres between places to obtain water and there are some toilets in one or two carparks and a cafe at the cultural centre(which is two kms away)In July temperatures varied from 2c to 22c so depending on time of day you make need a warm jacket. The rock climb will be closed soon and after learning how this has contributed to the pollution and damage to the previously pristine waterholes and environment around the rock it can't happen too soon. Several weeks after the experience I am still feeling in awe. This is one of my top memorable experiences.",3.0

However, the 10km walk around was are fall back option, and it was a good substitute. Feeling longer than 10k's, the walk includes information stops, small side tracks into areas close to the rock, and some great views that a climb wouldn't expose you to.

There is a great aquarium with fish found in the Finke River, and a close look at a Parentie, as well as pens with emu, red Roos and dingos. Presentations and activities started from 8.30 and the park was open from 7.30. Good keeper talks blending natural history and local tradition. Free flight presentation with birds was well done.. even the wild kites performed well.. The nocturnal house is large and well presented. Dont miss the Thorny devils eating ants.. Extensive supplementary plantings help with understanding the plant life, so it is equally a botanic park. We also did the nocturnal tour. This is in a separate fenced area, you walk through by red torch light while the keeper puts out supplementary food and talks about the many animals living there. We saw plenty of mala wallabies, brush tailed bettongs, and golden bandicoots. They come right up to you as long as you arent loud and noisy. It's not rushed. Also saw echidna and stick nest rats although the Bilby was a no show, but there were plenty of encounters and lots of info.

Time your visit to see the free bird flight show. It’s interesting, informative & well staged. Getting up close and personal with an eagle is also worth the additional cost. The wildflower section is currently in full bloom & stunning with the back drop of the ranges.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I believe it depends on the traveller and what it is you're looking to get out of it. Is it a bit packaged and expensive? Yes, but it's the only way to see it as it is in the middle of the desert. Personally, I loved it. We booked with Uluru Travel and paid $1310 por 2 pax, arriving on Nov 22nd at 1pm and leaving Nov 24th at noon. The package included p/u at airport, 2 night lodging at Emu Walks Apt, Field of Light tour, Sunrise & Kata Tjuta tour and Base and Sunset tour, all tours with guide, and return coach to airport. Quick general impresions. Field of Light tour. I was told to bring a flashlight as it is quite dark and desorienting. Didn't help. The problem is that though you follow the paths there comes a point where you're unsure how far you're going or have gone as there are no signs or any indications. I guess so as to not interfeare with the art work lights but still, you feel rather lost at times. Still, amazing how huge the exposition is. ATT Kings Coaches ok in general though bad experience with the Sunrise & Kata Tjuta tour. All coaches leave from the same place, the Desert Garden hotel which can be a bit caos as each is from a different operator and will help you little if you are in doubt. Our coach arrived about 15min late and nobody had any information about it. The driver and guide (named Ken? Not sure) seem bored with the whole thing and had a slow and really low manner of speaking that put you to sleep. Despite that watching the sunrise over Uluru was awesome. Return to the resort and you can choose pool time or different activities. And thank goodness for the guides in the Base & Sunset tour, Charlie & Ris, really made a difference. Animated, informative, you really got the feeling they knew and loved their job. The weather didn't hold up for the sunset but they were so nice, the people in the tour didn't really mind. I wasn't sure when I booked the tour if it would be worth it but I really was very glad to have done it.",3.7

Thankyou.,4.9
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"AMAZING INCREDIBLE UNFORGETTABLE are the words to describe my experience of doing the Pound Walk! If you've got the time and fitness...DO IT! It's 3-4 hrs walk, not extremely difficult but do require some good walking experience. Children can do it too if you think they are healthy and up for it. I met a father who brought his 1 yo baby boy and 5 yo girl to do this walk and they made it! The kids loved it and did incredibly well. I was so happy for them! Preparation is everything so make sure you prepare yourself well: Good broken-in hiking shoes, water 3L, sunscreen, flynet and hat. All of these are compulsory, esp the water and sunscreen. Walkers will be completely exposed to the sun with no shades at all from the starting point to finish. Wear the flynet cos the flies were extremely annoying and made it impossible to even see or breathe properly. The sun was already unforgiving early in the morning and it just sapped out all the moisture from your body and hence water of 3L was very essential. The walks followed clear paths in the first halfway through and went uphills. The highlight of the walk was when you reached the middle point and the path just opened up to reveal the whole landscape...INCREDIBLE!!! The last halfway was all dry rocky creekbeds. That's why a good and properly broken in hiking shoes was a must. Be prepared to do lots and lots of rock hoppings. When I was there, it was completely dry but during wet months, I read that walkers would need to take off the shoes and cross the waterhole. There's no defined path on these rocky bits so make your own path and just walk straight ahead. There would be arrows or sign every now and then to guide you. It all looked very exhausting and endlessly painful but the reward at the end of this walk was pretty sweet! I've got to swim in the amazing waterhole and it felt pretty awesome! Choose to swim right at the end of waterhole as soon as you finished the walk cos then you would avoid the crowds. I had the whole portion of the waterhole for myself cos no one made the effort to swim that far. Sweet as! It's an incredible walk that I will never ever forget.",4.8
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,If you live in the outback as I do you may think you know all about it. You dont. Visit the park it is very well done.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Seeing Uluru was so amazing, we saw it at sunrise, sunset, with mist over it, and during the day...not one of these sights failed to mesmerise me. We walked around it and it is so spiritual and it gives you a feeling of awe. The shape, size, carvings, crevices and folds in this magnificent rock totally gobsmacked me. Hearing an aboriginal talking about growing up in this region, and telling us about aboriginal life, was very interesting. We walked around it & it took us about two and a half hours..very surreal. We were also lucky that there had been rain, so the wild flowers and shrubs were in bloom and so pretty. For overseas visitors, and also Aussies this is a must to see.",4.6

By 2019 it was all gone from the app, with signs up all along the Lasseter HWY saying to keep away.

Just be aware that some of the most dangerous animals world wide live in Australia, so keep your eyes open for snakes and spiders. It`s best if you travel in a small group and get a tour guide. Make sure to sleep under the stars for at least one night . Seeing the milky way and the night sky is a truly inspiring and mind-blowing experience. Always stay open-minded, especially with the food. It may seem pretty weird to eat a camel burger or kangaroo bologna. But once you`ve tried it, it`s not too bad at all.The scenery is eye-popping.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We have just done 2 nights in Uluru staying at the Outback Pioneer. Whilst Uluru itself was magical, we completely agree that the resort makes the most of having a captive audience. If you are planning on going, don't fall for the ' you don't need a hire car as there's a free shuttle bus' routine, get yourself a car. It's well worth it and will work out cheaper than even one trip to see the Rock. Best tips we had was ignore the suggested sunrise area and go to the sunset one. Although you can't see the Rock changing colour, you get to see the sun come up next to the Rock. It was amazing. People we spoke to who did the official sunrise area we're disappointed as it was crowded and the Rock seemed in shadow most of the time. After sunrise we went to check out the bike hire- expensive but great fun, and found a BBQ site next to the Cultural centre. We had been really disappointed 're the bbqs facilities at Out back as we choose that accommodation as it advertised bbq facilities. What they didn't tell you was that you could only cook the stuff they supplied at greatly inflated prices. $102 ASD/ £60 for 2 chicken breasbreasts, 3 sausages and 1 steak plus salad made it one of the most expensive meals we've had in Oz!! When the enquired how much the bbqs we're, the rangers looked at us as if we were mad and said they were free - just leave them clean for the next person!!! This was the BEST thing ever. We had the place to ourselves, apart from a lone dingo and the view of the rock was amazing. It was the most magical evening ever. As we drove out we saw one of tge package dinner at sunset cpaches set up on the other side and we would have had to pay £600 for all of us to do that - instead of our $30 self as cooked feast!!! We went back with a donation the next day and almost had to fight to give it to the rangers!! So completely different to the resort who ask for a donation on check out! It's not listed it advertised anywhere but certainly worth know I g about.",4.3

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs can be a tricky one. It was beautiful when I travelled for work, but there is a lot of disadvantage and walking down the Todd Mall you will see the impacts of that. Stay at the Crowne Plaza if you can, it's got gates that require room keys to access. But will still have signs on the back of your room door that anything stolen is not their liability, so don't bring anything precious if you can avoid it. If you do, make sure you're ready to set up an insurance claim (have receipts etc.). There is a restaurant and casino on site there but both are fairly bleak. The Double Tree by Hilton next door also has a phenomenal Asian restaurant called Hanuman, and could also be a good place to stay but I can't vouch for it specifically. There is a great Italian restaurant in town called Casa Nostra with, I think, the best vanilla slice I've ever had in my life. Don't walk near the Todd River. Don't go anywhere by yourself.

The water was cold but others had been swimming there. You can also do a 35 min return walk to the ghost gum lookout. There is a section of steep stairs before you get a great view of the gorge and pound. There is also a longer walk I did not do.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Wow!! Impressive. Photos don’t do justice. The contrast between the red, blue and green is incredible and even better than imagined. The walks around and to the summit are beautiful. This was an amazing experience. We hired a car to get around and weren’t involved in any tours directly relating to Uluru. Everyone we came across during our 4 day stay in Yulara and visiting Uluru, Kata Tjuta and Kings Canyon were lovely. I dare say because we did not do any tours directly at Uluru we were able to enjoy our experience visiting and climbing without judgement from anyone we met in the vicinity (both local and or on contract). We didn’t directly ask opinions, just interacted as we would with anyone. We understand that people have different ideas about whether you should climb to the summit, we found that people not at all related to the area had the most to say both before and after our visit. We will never forget climbing to the summit. The views from the top were awesome, the whole experience was A…M…A…Z…I…N…G and unforgettable! If you plan to visit and attempt the summit before closure in October I would suggest it is more likely to open in the afternoon than the morning. Ensure you have good shoes, water and a snack, therefore no need to rush the experience. I would avoid on a hot, windy or wet day as I can imagine it would be quite unsafe (and likely wisely not open anyway). A level of fitness is ideal and common sense to stay safe wouldn’t go astray. It took us 3 hours up and down with 30 minutes at the summit to take in the splendour. We didn’t rush. Again… wow!",4.9
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"During our recent visit, the forecast called for rain and rain on vacation is never good - but not if you are at Uluru. As the park ranger stated - everyone comes for the sunrise and sunsets which can be spectacular but few see the unbelievable waterfalls created when it rains. From small quiet falls to a roaring 200 foot falls. Absolutely amazing site. I would strongly recommend renting a car to tour / visit the park. This provided us the opportunity to take advantage of this rare event. Having a car also allows you to be a contrarian - view the sunrise from the sunset viewing area and view the sunset from the sunrise area. I know it sounds crazy but I guarantee you will get a unique and interesting views. One more recommendation - if you visit in December, flies are very abundant and annoying. Buy a net to cover your head - you will not regret it.",4.0

Be sure to stop in the IGA store and get bug nets for you head. $3 well spent! Might want an umbrella too for when sun is high and HOT.Out of respect for the native people, we didn't climb it, but it was sooo tempting.

You can have grey and red patches next to eachother, at touching distance, dry. That's not refraction is it? Arkose is just a different colour... Like, there's patches on uluru that flake off, and underneath it's grey, which turns orange on the surface over time.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru/Ayers Rock is absolutely amazing. If anyone says it's just a rock then they can't have been and experienced it. I am so glad I didn't miss this. We stayed on the Campsite on Ayers Rock Resort as we had our own campervan. We stayed for 3nights/4days so we got to see the rock for Sunrise and Sunset. You must do both of these. Sunset was our favourite time the colour changes in the Rock are out of this world. There is an entrance fee to the rock of 25USD this is for 3 days so great value for money. We also did the Base Walk definitely worth doing we watched the sunrise first then went straight to do the walk as it was slightly cooler still 30 plus degrees but the sun wasn't fully on the rock so wasn't as intense. Do not miss seeing any of this it's amazing.,4.8

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Ayer's Rock now known as Uluru (Aborigine Name) in respect for the Aborigine groups ancient name for the rock. And one is seeing an icon of the world. What is especially good is viewing Uluru by both sunset and sunrise light because the light is reflecting off the surface by so many shades and hues and ever changing( worth the effort to get up early for the sunrise.) A few places around the rock are sacred spaces for the Aborigine group and photographing is prohibited out of respect for the site and the people. Note: be sure to wear a fly net over your face as the flies are terrible. They are seeking moisture and they fly into your eyes and mouth. And some places around Uluru were worse than others for the hoards of flies.,3.3

The walk is flat on a well maintained track, There is water available about half way along the walk, but it is advisable to take a couple of litres per person anyway. The changing shapes and colours of the rock give you some indication of why this place is sacred to Australia's indigenous people.

Our stay at Ormiston Gorge meant a swim in the waterhole, where clear, cool waters were framed by a serene red rock face with caves leading to a magnificent gorge. There are only three colours out here; orange, blue and green, the varying shades of these are determined by the ripples in the water and the shadows marking the time of day. The campsite isn't as busy as other campsites, so there's a chance you'll find some peace and quiet. It has all the amenities necessary to hookup a caravan- a charging station, bathroom block. And the sky is so clear. Because there's less light pollution around Ormiston Gorge, as there is, say in Alice, you can see a blanket of stars.",4.2

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,This is not the easiest place to visit but it is well worth the effort involved in getting there. A two night stay in the Ayer's rock resort will give you time to see sunrise and sunset. Park tickets are valid for 3 days and you can enter as many times as you want. I would recommend that you hire a car as this gives you the freedom to to do what you want. We hadn't pre- booked a car and were able to hire one at the resort. However we went out of school holidays and the hire car companies do recommend pre-booking.There are guided tours but these do tend to be long. It can be extremely hot and the flies are a pain. The shops in the resort do sell fly nets. You also need a lots of fluid and I would recommend buying a box of water bottles from the local shop.

Consumerism, Capitalism, addiction and a dire need for money has been forced upon them after they were self-sufficient and sober for thousands of years. Theft and crime happens for this reason. I was born and grew up in Alice. I saw the impacts of the Intervention, and right now we are seeing the the after effects of the intervention. Also, wet season is happening, so many remote community campers are stuck in Alice because of floods. I call for Australia to ban alcohol.

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Google got us worried and we almost didn’t visit when it was suggested a trip to Gunlom would take us 3 hours! Luckily, the rangers told us it’s 3 hours return. We drove in a 2WD to Gunlom from Cooinda lodge, leaving early so we could avoid the peak of the heat. Visiting at the end of May, the track was open to 2WD. The first hour of the drive is the highway so no issue. Once you reach the turnoff the unsealed road begins. We were very lucky as yesterday when we visited, the road was being ‘compressed’ and it made it a lot easier to drive. We took it slow on the way there so it took around 45-50 minutes. A 4WD could do it in 30 minutes. Once there, there is ample parking, toilets, a grassed shaded picnic area and tables. The main swimming area at the bottom of the falls is ideal for kids with a sandy bank, and areas that are shallow. Only 200m from the carpark, it’s very easy to access for everyone. Swimming all the way to the base of the fall the water gets deep. It’s a beautiful, postcard place to swim in Kakadu. If you can’t make it to the top, don’t feel too disappointed, the bottom is still wonderful. The infinity pools at the top of the falls are amazing and if you up for it, worth the hike. We had our 10 month old baby with us and my husband carried her in a MacPac to the top. He is fit and a confident walker so managed with no problem. The walk up has a few ‘bums and hands moments’ for some but if you take it slow you’ll be fine. I’m not overly confident, and managed without any issues. People did the climb in thongs when we were there and we saw other babies in carriers and children ranging in age from 6 to 12 who all managed. (I don’t think carrying a baby up would be possible if they couldn’t walk so a carrier of some kind seemed like a must). As a guide, allow 30 minutes to walk up. Taking drinks and food is a great idea so you can enjoy your swim and not feel rushed to make the trip back down. At the steepest parts of the walk, closest to the pools, there are rails and at other points trees or rocks you can grab to help give you some support. If you have visited Ubir and found that difficult, then the walk/climb is perhaps not for you. The infinity pools are beautiful to swim in and we are very glad we visited. Swimming at Kakadu was on our bucket list of experiences and without doubt a highlight of our trip up North. A couple of tips for those with small kids - the rocks are slippery, the water is deep in parts and the water is naturally quite cold. Taking float toys and float safety rings/vests makes it a lot easier for babies/toddlers! Unless you can confidently tread water and get in and out of the water holding them, on slippery rocks then it’s worth lugging few extra things up. There are some parts that small children can stand up in if helped there. The walk up is quite sunny but once at the top there are shaded parts to sit & swim.",3.5

The significance of the story of Moses at Mt Sinai and it's application to Judaism, Chsitianity and Islam far outweighs any vague claim any person can make that Uluru was anything more than just a shady spot in the desert. And I wouldn't use lack-of-consensus as an arguing point when you're talking about a rock with questionable spiritual significance at best.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After visiting our son in Brisbane Angie and I flew out to ULURU, to fulfil one of Angies childhood dreams to visit this holy monolith. As our plane descended over the desert, the majestic mountain came into view. We checked into the Emu Walk Apartments large spacious room, with living room and kitchenette. That evening we were taken to view ULURU, painted by the glorious colours of the setting sun ULURUs colour changes with each phase of the setting sun. We were served wine and tit bits as were gazed at and were amazed by Gods tapestry. An elderly lady taught me how to capture on camera an inverted image of ULURU as seen through a wine glass I was grateful to her for the experience. It was getting rather chilly, once the sun set and we made our back to our hotel. We looked for dinner but though western cuisine was easy to find, there was little Asian food only one person was selling noodles to me this was a rip off just some noodles with no vegetables or meat. Early the next morning we were taken back to view ULURU coloured by the morning sun again we were amazed by Gods handiwork I had little doubt that this was one of His homes on earth, and I supported all the native people who feel ULURU deserves all the respect we could give without insulting her by walking all over her. We returned to our apartments for breakfast and later set out to explore the desert and other monoliths in the area on the Kuniya Walk. Our guide pointed out caves and cave paintings by the native people. The sun painted the surrounding mountains in hues of red, orange and yellow. During the walk we were assailed but many flies and had great difficulty in preventing them from getting into our mouths, nostrils and ears we had come ill prepared head nets would have helped us so much. Once back at the hotel I came across a photography exhibition and bought a beautiful print that I admired so much this was a photograph of the Red Bank Gorge the photographer had waited patiently as the sun rose in the sky to capture the perfect moment when the sides of the gorge glowed in bright orange, blue and brown ; the photograph also captured the reflection of the gorge in the lake below. We then explore a small supermarket attached to the apartments and were pleasantly surprised by Haldrdirams pre packed Indian vegetarian food that night we had a feast the Basmati rice and chapattis were simply first class as were the sauces that went along. I also discovered Imalung lookout point which was about a kilometre walk from the apartments this enabled me more views of ULURU and other monoliths in the distance I took more setting sun pictures and got up before sunrise the following morning to catch the rising sun. Later that morning we were taken on a walk about around the apartments and shown various dessert flowers and edible fruits by a native elder. We then caught the evening flight back to Brisbane.",3.9

The weakest part was our Aboriginal guide who gave a lecture to help us understand his culture and their connection with the desert. Besides being boring our guide appeared to not really want to be there and have no enthusiasm at all. There was a small cafe and gift shop. I was bored the entire time and thought it was a waste of money.,2.3
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,You’ll be best rewarded if you break out and do some of the walks around the area. Stunning ancient landscapes which changing vistas. Snakes are active at night (including in the toilet blocks where they go to hunt frogs) so always carry a bright torch. They’ll do their utmost to avoid you but I wouldn’t want to step on one by mistake.,4.2

Over a period of a few days we were able to see the colours change at sunset, and to explore the perimeter with the excellent guides from AAKings. I was fascinated by the cave paintings and in particular the imprint of the hand; one cannot fail to be considerate of the cultural heritage and significance of Uluru. A must see.",4.7

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Alice Springs Desert Park,"From the guardian live blog Linda Burney has told ABC radio that she believes “very deeply” that the situation in Alice Springs would not have escalated like it has had there been an Indigenous voice to parliament. [If] the voice of the parliament had been established previously … we wouldn’t be where we are in terms of Alice Springs at the moment because we would be getting practical advice from people who are representative of the community in relation to these social issues. I mean, it is wrong to think that the issue out here is just alcohol … There is a seasonal issue involved. Karvelas: Do you really think that if we’d had a voice to parliament, making recommendations, you wouldn’t have seen this situation escalate? Burney: I do believe that very very deeply. That’s the whole point. Karvelas: But the voices were telling you – they might not have been enshrined in the constitution, minister, but they were telling you and the Northern Territory government that things were going to explode. Burney: Which is why we are responding, which is why there was substantial money committed in the budget towards central Australia.

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Came here as part of a 3-day 4WD tour of Kakadu National Park. Saw the plunge pool at the foot of the hill but we decided to skip that as apparently, there had been a freshwater crocodile sighting not far from the camp grounds several days earlier. We'd also heard a lot from our guide about how scenic the terraced pools were from the top. It turned out to be quite a hike from the foot of the hill, and fairly steep in some parts. But what amazing views from the top! We were blessed with clear skies on the day we were there, and we could see for miles across the South Alligator River valley and the Marrawal plateau. But really, the plunge pools were an attraction in their own right. Nice areas to just sit around and relax. In the deeper pools, the water was noticeably dark, presumably from runoff of plant-based tannin, but it was clean. And while there was little danger from the current of the water flowing past, just be careful not to get too close to the edge - it's a fairly long way down.",3.9

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The free flying bird show is just amazing and it gave me a greater understanding of the birds of the desert; how they live and hunt. We arrived early at the park and most of the animals were just waking up for the day. Depends on where you're from and your knowledge of the Australian flora and fauna as to whether you will be enthralled with what's in the park. I did expect that people would be able to interact with the animals, like at Australia Zoo, for example; but then I appreciate this Park is a different concept. I would also like to see more done on the dingoes with the establishment of a breeding program rather than a brother and sister that can't breed. Dingoes are an Australian icon and should be preserved and protected regardless of their predatory behaviour. If you're not really into fauna that can't be touched or petted then this is probably not the place for you. It's more educational exhibits than ""cute"" exhibits. It does highlight though that Australia needs to do more to protect it's native species and work to remove those from the endangered list. The survival in the desert talk was very interesting and I learnt a lot about indigenous Australians. I gave it a ""very good"" on the basis of the bird show and the survival talk alone.",4.1

Reddit/worldnews,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For you, /u/taoistturtle and /u/woody678 , even as somebody who really values the rights of indingioous people and respecting their culture and history (nearly all of my posts on reddit are about Indigenous Mexican cultures), I really disagree with this decision and I think the way you 3 are phrasing this as a black and white issue is unfair. I can appreciate the fact that the indigenous people of Australia have faced massive historical injustices, and I think it's reasonable for those people to be the owners of the land they traditionally inhabited. Hell, I wouldn't even necessarily be opposed to if Australia outright gave tons of land back to those groups and recognized them as separate sovereign nations that Australia had no authority over, complete with reparation payments. But here's the thing: As far as I can tell, the decision to not allow climbing is being made on religious grounds. I don't agree that rules or regulations should be made on the basis of religion, that one people's beliefs should dictate what people who don't have those beliefs are allowed to do. I don't think that the fact that these people have historically and still face inequality and oppression changes that: It doesn't make their religious or spiritual views any more real then anybody elses, so peopple shouldn't have to be beholden to them. Like, if their religious traditions weren't that it's bad to climb Uluru, but rather that it's bad for *women* to climb it, would you all also support a ban only for women climbers?",1.7

However the one I did was swag camping to keep costs down and mostly people under 30, it was also pretty active. I’m sure there are tours with older crowds/proper accommodation, though they will be more expensive as everything round there is extortionate - but you’ll be paying a lot for Yulara accommodation, food, car hire and fuel anyway. There’s some great stuff out there but don’t underestimate the distances. And definitely bring a fly net!

I must admit that walking about in almost total darkness, sounds strange. You are provided with a (Red Light) headlamp torch so that that you can watch where you are going. The two expert guides have high powered (Red Light) torches that they use to spot the wildlife. A red light, unlike white light, doesn't disturb the wildlife, but they can see it. The expert guides know their animals very well, even their different personalities. This made the tour both informative as well as fun. I didn't know that a Bilby could get Arthritis.

This is a must-see on a trip to Australia! We were fortunate that during our visit, the wildflowers were in bloom, and everyone said that it was the most impressive display of flowers in over 10 years due to some extra rain this year. We went the easy route, and flew into Ayers Rock airport, were picked up by the resort shuttle, and then went with a tour company for the evening tour, sunset viewing and BBQ dinner under the stars, followed by a sunrise viewing and morning hike. The park has a great cultural center that helps visitors learn about the native people who were just given back control of their land and are kindly still allowing all of us to visit! If anyone reads the displays, listens to the stories, and still think it would be a good idea to climb Uluru, I'd be floored. It makes it clear that the requests not to climb or photograph certain areas are really just about respecting another culture's sacred spaces. Uluru is truly a sight to behold in daylight as well as sunset and sunrise. Kata Tjuta is equally impressive; our morning hike on day 2 was in that area.

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Gunlom Waterfall Creek is a fantastic away from it all adventure for the whole family. From heavy-duty 4WDs to small hatchbacks this is one of the many amazing places to visit in Kakadu National Park. Campers to day-trippers make the journey on the corrugated unsealed road. It's a 47km drive off the Kakadu Highway but well worth it to make the climb to the infinity pools. The steep climb is challenging at times but parents with babies in backpacks and people hauling giant pool toys are not deterred. If that's too much there is a beautiful swimming hole at the bottom of the falls and easily accessible. Lots of great camping sites with fire pits and clean basic shower and toilet facilities. If you plan to camp and stay a couple of days take a tent and plenty of water. Camping fees are $38.50 for a family. You should also note there is no mobile service in this area however that adds to the getting away from it all!

I don't believe you could possibly do the climb once you open your eyes to this..in fact I truly cannot understand why people still choose to climb. Take a guided tour as well and learn more about the significance of several areas of the rock, including areas you are forbidden for photographing. Our ranger explained that climbers leave rubbish at the top of the rock which flows into water systems when it rains and 35 people have died climbing as well. I only wish the climb was already closed, as the rock has been destroyed in the area where walkers have trampled and poles have been erected to support them.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,What can I say? I guess Uluru speaks for itself but I will say it is much more impressive than on those glossy photos.

So go on and book your tour!,4.5
Reddit/miniminutemanfans,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's obviously high quality chocolate. Big cocoa wants to hoard it for themselves while they continue to give us the shitty stuff. The Australian natives (we can't be bothered to learn the official names of people groups) originally made pyramids out of chocolate, and they were kept cold during the ice age. Sadly, most of them melted after the ice age. Uluru is the last remaining chocolate pyramid because the natives covered the what was left in cocoa pods. They weren't able to get all of it covered in time, which is why it isn't a perfect pyramid anymore. Seriously though, the cocoa industry is extremely corrupt and really supports unethical labor practices i.e. child slave labor",2.9

Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If youre an explorer and like going places that not many people go to then whats so special about Uluru, probably the most famous rock on Earth? And why climb it, a place that thousands of people climb yearly? Also a big part of the philosophy of explorers is respecting the land. Any true explorer respects local cultures and customs, and the land that they explore, as to preserve it for future generations to enjoy. Its very selfish to just want to climb where you want and damage where you want in the name of 'exploration' and its spitting in the face of every true explorer. Uluru is perfectly mapped as is due to satellites and as I said you can gain a much better view from down below as you cant really see it when standing atop it, so theres not much to 'explore' up top. While I agree that I don't think man should have claim over land as land belongs to everyone, I dont think that means you should be able to just be disrespectful to people's culture. The locals to every sacred place have no legal ownership of the land and won't force you off it, so you can go if you want, but you are heavoly disrespecting them by doing so. If its an accident then they'll let you off, if its intentional then you're a dick and thats it really. You sound like the typical 13 year old edgy athiest and its really tiring, it makes me embarrassed to call myself an athiest. Just because I dont believe in gods doesn't mean other people are stupid for believing in them. People can believe in what they want, its a free world, and I only have an issue if their beliefs encroach on my freedoms which is only an issue very infrequently. Theres a difference betweeb choosing to not believe in something, and then being mean to everyone else who does believe in something. Like I said its really not that hard to just not be disrespectful, being disrespectful is an active choice and choosing it makes you a dick, no 'if's or 'but's.",3.2
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"With great respect to the indigenous owners and as fellow Australians, my husband and I climbed the rock as planned! It was a bucket list item and we do not regret it! Such a majestic feat! The climb was closed first thing so we did the base walk which we enjoyed. Then late morning they opened the gates and a steady stream of people started the ascent! Wear good hiking shoes as it is a slippery climb. Well... I keep myself somewhat fit but I’ll admit it was very very tough. Like really hard. I was actually surprised how difficult and treacherous the climb was!? The guide joked about the “80’s safety protocol!” Anyway we made it the top! It took us all up round trip about 2h 15mins (with 1h 30m of that to get up)! Just stop and stare and breathe it all in. In the heart of this great land! Spectacular views. Almost lunar Mars like landscape up there. Couldn’t believe the sheer size of the rock! If you can, get there before October 2019 when they close the climb and stop sharing this wonderful piece of Australia! Such a shame.",4.0

The view was amazing and gave us a real taste of the area. The walk continues on to become a much longer loop, while we retraced our steps back to the carpark. We saw (and heard) lots of Flying Foxes in the trees around the river. When the crocodile risk is low, kayaking on the river would also be a great way to see the gorges.

Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"In Australia the people who live on the lands don't tend to be political. But sometimes others try to get them to be. That's when you have things like this occur. When my parents first went there, they drove the two wheeled track and shot a few dingos for their scalps to pay for their fuel. There was no climbing, because there was no chain. The town was just fuel and a bit of food. Mostly there to serve the community nearby, not a lot of tourists. When I first climbed Uluru (Ayres Rock back then). You drive up to it after crossing the countryside and climbed it. There wasn't a big bus park and a line of people. You might see a couple of other 4x4s at the base and pass some people on their way down while you were on your way up and have a chat etc. Around the back, where a road led off to the Aboriginal town, the waste as everywhere. I guess the tourists mostly took their waste with them, or rangers cleaned it up, but the town was a tip. The second time I climbed it with some relatives from overseas. Yulara was a lot bigger. There was a gate to pass through before getting too close to Uluru, run by indigenous people, but not Anangu, they were from Sydney! The place was imaculate, that gate fee clearly payed for a lot of cleanup, signs, fencing etc. This was the first time I had even heard about an issue with climbing, other than the physical dangers of course. There were a lot of visitors and if you were going to feel anything spiritual you would probably have to come at midnight when the crowds had died off. It's become political more than spiritual. A big stone power play. By the way, the view from the top is spectacular. There may be ""nothing"" around, but that's the point. It makes you realise just how unique the rock is. How isolated. The land around you goes on forever and you feel raised up in the middle of nowhere. You will never feel that way in a helicopter or see the same sights with a drone.

There are a few pools to swim in at the top. The water is lovely. If you camp you can eat up there early before any tours arrive. It’s perfect when you have it to yourself or with a couple of people.,4.2
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The film exploring the history of the land and how it formed was well done with the back drop falling to meet the outback view at the end was fantastic. The flora was magnificent. The only dislike I had was the small enclosure for the kangaroos.\Otherwise this as a really nice calm peaceful place to visit.,3.9
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This was honestly amazing, and I'd say if you go to Alice Springs you really have to come visit the park. It's in beautiful surrounds, near town and easy to get to but far enough into the bush that it feels isolate and natural. Sitting right up against Tjoritja/the West MacDonnell range, it's a lovely spot to be. First, we went to watch the (free) bird show, which I'd highly recommend. They have lots of birds fly through the stands, over your heads, and teach us about birds commonly found in Central Australia. While we were there, Sophie and Angus ran the bird show, and did a fantastic job. The falcon and wedge-tailed eagle were particular favourites, and I got to get a photo with a snowy owl perched on my hand after the show which was super cool. They charge a small fee ($10) to get a photo with the birds afterwards, which I though was more than worth it and a great way to give back to such a meaningful place. We then walked around the park and saw most of the exhibits. Seeing the emus up close was great (they're huge!), but my personal favourite was the bird enclosures. The park is filled with small buildings attached to large outdoor enclosed areas, and you go throuhg a set of double doors to get in and see the birds. When you walk in, it's quiet and you'd think it was empty, but if you sit quitely for a few minutes all the birds come out and walk, fly, and sing around their little home, it's amazing. I couldn't recommend this more highly, I had a blast. Next time I come to Alice, I'll be back for sure.",4.2
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A wonderful place and a must see. Loose yourself in its beauty. It is just the most fabulous rock to walk around. Caves and cave art. Waterhole and some water running down the rock. So much to read and learn on the way around. Take plenty of water.,4.9

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),I rated the cruise as excellent but there were some issues with the walks. Depending on which direction you started a walk (clockwise versus anti clockwise) the sign posting could be pretty ordinary. When you are walking 10+ kms in above 30 degree heat this can be an issue. Also a lot of the trail is very slippery with loose rocks and sand. We had appropriate footwear and still found ourselves having to be very careful to avoid falling. Having said this there is no disputing the sights are breath taking standing at the top of the gorge looking down and it is a different perspective from the vantage point on the boat. Would recommend,3.3

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great synopsis! Your comment about similar moves from country to city being indicative of wider changes has always rattled around in the back of my mind. I used to live in a small country town in the early 1990s, pop. ~500 in winter, then temporarily the tourists would boost the town to ~20,000 over summer. When housing and cost of living was relatively cheap my small country town was a low income inhabitant haven plus sea change families. Pot was pretty common and there was the very occasional social issue with someone not coping and losing their shit. But that all slowly changed with basic necessity price rises and suddenly more attractive financial options for property investment pushing many of the poorer permanent population out and cutting down on most opportunities for young folk just starting out in life. With the decrease in the quality of life for locals there appeared to be an increase in harder drugs and more antisocial behaviours. Plus the council got overrun by developers changing the whole cultural direction of the town, and the whole vibe of the town changed, delicate ecologies that attracted tourism were flattened and built on, and gentrification totally changed the local socioeconomic demographics. Turning it into essentially a summer time suburb for rich Sydney and Canberra folk who owned or could afford to rent a house, with very little off season culture compared to historically. And whenever I look into the changes happening in outback towns, and the similar time frames their changes have been occurring. It gets me wondering if the forces driving these increasingly undesirable social changes are a nation wide phenomena? And that vulnerable places like Alice Springs, or to a lesser extent the country town I used to live in, aren’t just the canaries in the coal mine for wider societal issues that are a consequence of the previous forty years of legislated changes, and political populism and perceived social priorities? My gut instinct is that whatever sociopolitical direction that would increase the viability of life in rural, remote and country towns, would also benefit communities like Alice 🤷‍♂️ hope that wasn’t too incoherent.",4.2
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"IIRC, for one the main climbing path takes people past sites that were used to initiate children into either manhood or womanhood. Photographing or trampling over such sites affects the dignity of the ceremony and the status of men or women in their community. Second, in many indigenous cultures there is no such thing as an accidental death. Someone dying accidentally can be attributed to malignant intent or witchcraft. Before colonisation, if one aboriginal person visited another group's territory and died it could trigger inter group suspicion and conflict. So if an indigenous group invites you onto their land, it is greatly distressing to them if you then hurt yourself or die, as many attempted Uluru climbers have.",2.6

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As someone who has (and still does) lived in Darwin their whole life, I encourage all Aussies to read what this person has to say. The issues facing Alice Springs, as well as the NT as a whole, are incredibly complex and will not be solved by the restrictions on alcohol alone. These problems have existed for as long as I have lived here (I’m almost 30) and if you speak to any Territorian, they are progressively getting worse. Crime/antisocial behaviour/public drunkenness is so prevalent in public spaces, complacency and desensitisation by onlookers to incidents (that can sometimes occur right in front of them) is sadly quite common. Unfortunately, the people that cause this antisocial behaviour have the result of generations neglect and failed policies by their own governments and sadly, their own people at times. Some of the stories that have arisen in the media of recent times are heartbreakingly real and are the daily lives of people in a “first world country”. How do you fix this? There is no simple/easy solution or answer - rather it WILL take all levels of Governments (local, state and federal - hell, even chuck the Opposition into this) working with First Nations Leader/s and NGOs to come up with a plan that is lead and managed by their own people. It’s easy to say this, but so so so hard to even begin this process. Education, health, housing, safety - these are basic human needs that are either severely lacking or even non existent for some. I love the NT - it is breathtaking beautiful and the lifestyle is truely unique (there is nowhere else like it in our country) but it’s changing and not for the better. I do not want to raise my children here long term and it’s sad to think that they may not have some of the experiences I got to have growing up here.",2.3

The links I've given you show fairly clearly that babies being assaulted is likely to be 4-5 steps along. >*The problems with crime in the NT go back far further than covid.. many many years.* I absolutely agree with this. Yes there are areas in Australia and around the world where crime is higher, and places where crime is lower. But crime sometimes spikes upward. That is the case in Alice Springs.

To end our day, before walking around the park, we attended the 11am Survival talk at Awaye Flat which was my favourite part of the day. Doug was knowledgable, inspiring, gentle and a great teacher. Listening to history dating back over 30,000 years (in 40 mins) of his people, our First Nations people of Australia was an honour.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"For those of you who have visited US National Parks in Utah, Uluru may not be that special of a sandstone formation. The Delicate Arch at Arches has a more stunning shape. The walls of Zion is as massive. And the hoodoos of Bryce are more colorful.

It doesn't smack you in the face with stunning wonderfulness of a landscape, but if you take the time, it does reveal its majesty and charm. Having your own car would make it much easier and more comfortable to experience the park. There aren't many hiking trails in the park, so you can't just walk everywhere.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is the most spiritual and beautiful place I've ever visited in my life! We did an unguided walk, called the 'Base Walk', which is ca. 10km long. It was very warm but a few trees and fairly regular resting areas provided enough opportunities to cool down a bit. As there are plenty of signs with stories and explanations, we didn't feel like needing a guide. What upsets me is the behaviour of some people: some parts of Uluru are labelled as 'Sensitive Sites', with the request not to photograph them in respect of the cultural/religious importance for the indigenous people. Many tourists just ignored that, which is a pity. Take in this breathtaking view and keep it in you heart, not on your phone/camera! (Same is true for climbing the rock. Please show some respect!)

I have been there many times, often with a glass of bubbly or a beer and just been blown away by the sheer majesty of the vista.",3.9

Very young population, lots of international students, there seems to be people from all over the world, it’s very cosmopolitan considering where it is. Young girls jogging by the river, kids walking home from school, all quite normal. Yes a few blocks in the city near Coles and Woolworths where aborigines gather, and seem intoxicated, and they do wander into the nearby malls, yell at each other, but while we were there they didn’t seem to be causing trouble.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After dreaming of visiting Uluru and Kata Tjuta for a long long time I finally visited this week. We could only get 2 nights there but boy did we squeeze as much as we could in. 2 sunsets and a sunrise , the walk around the base , the Mala tour , Sounds of SIlence , Field of Lights , Camping. So here is what I have to say for futures visitors of the area.Hire a Car, it is absolutely the best way to get around and it means that you are not restricted to bus schedules.There's an IGA near the hotel area. The best breakfast however was at the Cultural centre !! $12.50 for a massive breakfast of eggs , toast , baked beans , bacon and tomato, there's a coffee van at the base of the rock, and the coffee was $5 . Food such as hot chips etc can also be found at the petrol station.Do yourself a favour and do not leave the area without visiting the cultural centre it is just wonderful with lots of art , a beautiful free movie on the history of the hand back , books to read , classes on dot painting and bush tucker. Get yourself a face net if you can before you get there as they can range from $10 - $20 once you are in the area,the flies can really just start to get to you after a while. There is limited phone reception at the rock. I hope I have shed some light on the area just a little for any future visitors. Enjoy the magic that is Uluru",4.5
Reddit/darwin,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I mean thank you for proving my point. Such hostility. I’m sure the Aboriginal community have such rigorous plans to curb the violence, youth crime, incestual sexual violence, alcoholism, domestic violence and so on. You’re completely correct that doesn’t impact absolutely ANYONE other than people in the Aboriginal community and that white people should never say anything about them because it has as you say nothing to do with them. Especially when it’s the white peoples homes being broken into, cars stolen and racial slurs thrown against. Nah got nothing to do with them at all. In particular it’s not the Prime Minister business because he doesn’t govern everyone in Australia. Not at all. It’s people like you that frustrate the fuck out of me because you work on the assumption that the Aboriginal community can get its shit together if it was just left alone. Wel guess what?

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,A 5 minute stroll from the carpark leads to a wonderful swimming hole surrounded by red rock cliffs and the odd white gum. On a hot day (and there are plenty in this part of the world) this is just the ticket. The water is deep in places so perhaps not a good idea for little children or those who can't swim. There are other walks to explore that are probably best left for the cooler weather. This is also a great place for a picnic.,4.4
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I worked with the NT Police for a month in 2020 and all the stuff they talked about was just how crazy Alice Springs really was. And the biggest problems were DV and youths running rampant. I spoke with a probationary cop who'd been in the force only four months and in that time she'd already spiked three cars driven by youths. They all supported the use of spit hoods because spitting is all but guaranteed. One thing that really surprised me is that they noticed that once the youths turned 17-18 they all but ceased becoming brats because they knew they'd be held accountable for their actions. One good thing the cops said was that because of all the crime, the pay was really good and there was no shortage of overtime with most cops pulling in over $150K a year in Alice with all the OT and allowances.",3.4

Reddit/OldPhotosInRealLife,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Northern Territory of Australia's archives online has this photo in the Smith Collection, under 'Aboriginal Peoples' (Australian) with no further info. [https://hdl.handle.net/10070/721715](https://hdl.handle.net/10070/721715) What I see, is the hills south of the Alice Springs Telegraph Station, a housegirl I know to be Dolly on the right, and a Telegraph Pole in the background... Could be a Frank Gillen Photo or a Thomas Bradshaw photo. I am leaning towards Frank Gillen, because he was very friendly with the Arrernte, and Dolly (on the right) was his favourite. He made heaps of photos with Dolly in it. He also bothered her for nude photos but his wife had instilled a firm Christian 'no' to that... That didn't stop him because I have seen her in several nude photos in the guise of 'typical native' anthropological photos. Anyway, the 'tells' that show me where this might be, were/are difficult to see... The only way to find this was to take photos home and study them on the computer, to look for rocks that might match. To get to the right place I just follow vertical lines in the photo until they converge at the camera. The Telegraph pole in the picture puts the date at after April 1899. In relocating the line here with an extra copper wire was the last thing Frank Gillen did, before handing over to his replacement, Stationmaster Thomas Bradshaw. Thomas Bradshaw initially tried to avoid the role of 'Protector of Aboriginals' and tried to palm it off to the local Mounted Constable. Gillen was rope-able, because hew reckoned the policeman was always either drunk or recovering from being drunk. Gillen therefore thought good relations would go downhill, hence Bradshaw taking photos of Arrernte in their camp seems less likely. More likely Gillen took photos of his Arrernte friends before he left. Dolly was taken over by Bradshaw as housegirl (nanny housemaid), but the Bradshaws soon 'let her go', whereas Gillen's photos of Dolly smack of infatuation. I spotted stripy jumpers on jockeys at the racecourse and that makes sense. Frank Gillen is Stipendary Magistrate and president of the region’s turf club. The region is about the size of France and only has a few hundred white people in it. He probably bought the jumpers for the club so they ended up at the Telegraph Station. The housegirls were not paid but did receive goods in lieu of payment… By finding the correct location we can also learn that the women’s camp was right alongside the Main North Road. The Telegraph Track from Adelaide to Port Darwin. The occasional traveler became a stream of miners around 1904 when gold was found at Winnecke goldfields. The open area beside the track here was also a camp arra used by travelers and the Cameleers with their 60or so camels of the supply ‘camel trains’. The camel smell upset the horses and cattle kept at the Station yards, and therefore had to stay some distance away. Camping near the women appeared to be a mutually agreeable arrangement… Cameleers also hawked or traded knickknacks, tobacco, pipes, scarves and haberdashery. So every time I find an old photo location I learn something new.",3.0

C) child removal rates in alice springs are higher than they were before the apology to stolen generations - more than double the national rate. if concerns over racism, ramping over-representation of prisoners and increasing rates of child removal were dominating discussion about DV, we'd see less racism, less prison for petty crimes and fewer child removals.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spent a lovely afternoon here. Highlight for me was the nocturnal house which is excellent. Really well done.

We saw the filmshow as our last part before leaving in the afternoon and that was fantastic too. Very good use of the surrounding features. Very glad we visited. Would highly recommend.,4.5

The nocturnal exhibit was surprisingly large and really well done, we saw all the little native mammals, geckos, snakes etc. Its quite a big area so could easily fill a couple hours to a half day (depending if you go to all the talks which seem to be staggered early in the morning, or late in the afternoon ie there is a big gap between 1030am and 130pm). If you only have time in Alice to see a couple of things, or dont have much chance to get out on the road, I'd rate this highly as its a snapshot of the desert animals and plants in a well done natural setting.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The main purpose of our visit to Uluru was to hike up Ayers rock before access was closed off for this Aboriginal ""sacred site"". We tried to climb this rock over a period of four days from November 24th thru the 27th, 2017. Every time we showed up at the rock (typically 3 times a day) there was a new excuse on why access was closed: too windy (20 mph, really?) will get to hot today (that is why we were there at 7 am, to climb it when it was cool), the rock is too wet (it rained at 7 pm the night before, the rock was dry), or forecast rain (forecast had showers for 5 pm that evening, again that is why we were there at 7 am (not a cloud in the sky), takes 3 hours for the hike if your slow). Our opinion is that access to climbing the rock is already functionally closed, they are just spinning excuses (in the name of safety) to please the Aborigines. However they don't want to publicize this, because they want to keep the money spigot on. If your main goal (like ours was) to visit the area is to hike up the rock, don't waste your time or money going to it. If you like Aboriginal dot art, and doing some other hikes in the area, go ahead and visit. For my 2 cents there are other better hikes around the Moab, Zion National Park area.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a large rock, a large red rock, an amazing, mind numbingly large red rock, at the right angle it can look like a big red wave heading straight for you. From the air it looks like an arrowhead, pointing at Mutitjulu. I have seen people burst into tears when they sight the rock on the flight in, it can evoke that kind of reaction. It is also damn hot during the day, and freezing at night. You will need a park pass to get in, the pass is for 3 days and will cost you $38 (at time of writing).",3.9
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"I can't imagine you travel here just see the boulders, but for me this is a must stop on any journey past. We arrived at the campsite (basic but very cheap - only a drop toilet facility) just before sunset. I have to say it was very busy but we got our campervan parked and had a view of the boulders as the sun fell. It was a very magical and spiritual experience. We also got up before sunrise to watch the sun coming up and the colour change (the children were thinking more like a disney style multi-coloured change with Tinkerbell dancing on the rocks rather than differing hues of red but never mind!). We had a lovely walk round in the morning while the sun rise and even though I would say the campground was at full capacity, we didn't really see anyone else around and it was very peaceful. A definate worthwhile overnight stop for me.",4.6

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I went to Katherine Gorge with my friend and we had rented a canoe for the day. It was really a great experience, since we were able to paddle the first 3 gorges, have a picnic and a swim and head back to return the canoe by 16:30. I highly recommend renting the canoe for the whole day, because if you rent a canoe only for 4 hours (half a day) you can only paddle in the first gorge, stop for a swim and paddle back, which is a pity since the second and third gorges are far more beautiful than the first one. When you reach the end of the first gorge, you leave your canoe on the bank, walk a little bit on a boardwalk, and get a different canoe on the other side of the rapids. But when you reach the end of the second gorge, you have to carry your canoe over the rocks, and it is extremely heavy. I really believed we wouldn't make it, and we decided actually to push the canoe through the rapids while walking along in the water. There is a limited number of canoes allowed beyond the first gorge, so booking ahead is recommended. You don't have to be an experienced paddler, you just need a good level of fitness.",3.8

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Incredible sight especially for sunrise and sunset. The rock changes color by the minutes. At the peak - it turns bright orange. Do walk around the rock especially kata Tjuta (50km away). Spectacular scenery - walk when it is cool (too dangerous if temperature is 36C and above). You will need 3 days to take in all (because most of the day are too hot to do any activity) and the minimum 3 days pass A$25 per person. Accommodation, food & gasoline is very expensive.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I agree with the closing of the Uluru climb. To hear that people of all cultures have been so disrespectful of such a wonderful icon has made me very sad. Its terrible that once people have reached the top that they find it necessary to deficate the area. Ie wee and I dare so pooh when they get to the top which is just appalling. I know that there are no toilets on top and it's hard to put any due to it being a monolith. But this is a good reason to close it as it has damaged a very delicate and sensitive ecosystem. Perhaps in years to come the indigenous cultural will be able to re open the climb once it has had time to repair itself. I can see a similar setup as on the Sydney Bridge climb ie booking and paying to use this facility. Also wearing sensitive protective clothing, shoes, hat etc done with an idigenous guide. With very limited numbers. Just an idea.",2.0

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,This Gorge is about 4kms from Glen Helen Resort. The gorge itself has a selection of walks with varying degrees of difficulty. We did the walk up to the lookout over the gorge and then continued to climb down to the valley. This was a moderate walk and involved a lot of scrambling over rocks especially down in the valley. It's best to start early in the morning as it can get very hot and this walk doesn't offer much shade until you get to the valley. You can swim in the gorge but even in summer it's very very cold! There is a much welcomed kiosk which opens at 10am and they sell a variety of drinks including decent coffee. They also do some tasty snacks. You can even recharge your phone and devices. There are toilet facilities too. Be sure to take plenty of water if going on the longer walks. The gorge itself was beautiful and we even spotted a rock wallaby.,4.3

Would highly recommend making the climb to the top of the falls where there’s a lookout over the vast beauty that is the Kakadu, and some beautiful pools to swim in and cool off once you get there. You would need good mobility and fitness to make it up as it’s a steep climb. The water levels in the top pools had dropped a little but with higher levels these pools form a natural infinity pool looking out over the unspoilt Kakadu. Would definitely recommend.",3.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visiting and climbing Uluru (or Ayres Rock as it used to be known) has been on my bucket list for many years. However those who manage the site feel they should ban people from climbing and will do so from the 26th October 2019. So I made sure I booked in the family to go there while we still could. As flights there and accommodation are so expensive you want to make sure you make the most of your visit. (for comparison I booked the family for a holiday in Japan for less than it was for our trip from Sydney to Uluru). Seeing sunrise and sunset on the rock in the National Park was beautiful, and the personal highlight was being able to climb the rock and look out across the desert across to Kata Tjuta (formerly The Olgas). The risk when you visit is that there are days when the rock is closed to climbers due to the weather, winds, or other cultural reasons. Of the four days we were there, it was only open for climbing one day. If cannot or choose not to climb the walk around the base of the rock is amazing to see the lesser known aspects of the rock -the pools of water, the caves, the rock art, and the varying shapes and textures. The drive out to Kata Tjuta is worth doing for another series of walks. The nearly cultural centre has some interesting displays and the slowest cafe I have ever encountered -so make sure you have plenty of time if you plan to buy a drink or have lunch there.",3.8

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Went to the Desert Park on my way into town from King's Canyon and spent a few hours there. Definitely a large and varied facility with the full spectrum of Australian outback wildlife. Highlights were the nocturnal animal house, being able to walk around inside the kangaroo exhibit and (especially) the phenomenal bird show. It is, as most zoos, catered mostly towards kids, but there is still enough to see as an adult. Only downside for me was that in a LOT of exhibits the animals were not visible (excluding the birds). This is a fairly natural consequence of going to a desert in the middle of the day when it is 38C+, but still disappoint. Also, as with everything in the Outback, it is hella expensive to get in (~$25). Otherwise well worth your time if you've come out to Alice Springs, especially if you are with children.",3.4

It has been a long time ambition of mine to climb it and whilst I respect and understand the decision to close it, I did do the climb because the Aboriginal Elders accepted that many people had made plans to do it and they are keeping it open to enable those people to tick it off their list and to not disappoint them.

The trek up to the top plunge pool was quite a challenge, but worth it. The water down the bottom with the beach was also very nice - we were advised not to swim the bottom due to crocs, but plenty of people were.

There are so many scenic and interesting places to experience, that flying to the Centre just for Uluru seems such a sub-optimal choice. There are 3-4 wonderful drives from Alice - day-trips. The drive to Yulara is long, but we love it, and have done some or all of it many times. Kings Canyon should not be missed. For almost all the things that most tourists will do, Alice Springs isn't dangerous.

Peaceful, and certainly gave us cause toreflect on traditional life there for thousands of year before us. The facilities at The resort are excellent. It’s not cheap, but one must remember the infrastructure there is almost totally for the visitors, and it’s a very remote place. All staff we met were friendly and very efficient. Kata Tjuta is excellent too. The walk around the valley of the winds is very difficult in places. Those with weak legs and dodgey knees need to seriously reconsider going!

Reddit/australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"As someone commented, the term originated in Canada, but I don't see why it can't be used in Australia. For one thing, it's First Nation**s** plural, since as you point out Aboriginal people are not one homogenous group. Looking up the definition of 'nation' gives me ""a body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory"". I don't see why that couldn't apply to each tribe. Different people will prefer different terms but some find 'First Nations' or 'First Peoples' more respectful than 'Aboriginal' or 'Indigenous'. Obviously it's not a traditional Aboriginal title, but neither are the terms ""Aboriginal"" or ""Indigenous"".

That is because Anzac Day is sacred to a good many Australians. Nothing to do with religion. People are also asked not to climb as it is pretty dangerous with something like 30 people having died while attempting to climb it.

We went on a bunch of hikes, waterfalls, and swimming holes in those places and in between, although we also missed Kakadu unfortunately. From Alice we flew back to Sydney where we only paid a bit extra to drop the 4WD camper. Pretty sure this whole trip cost us ~$3000-$3500 for the 10 or 11 days, so about $1.5k-$1.75k each. But this included everything - flights, car rental (and accommodation since we slept in the 4WD camper), one night accoms in Darwin and Alice, fuel (got a bit expensive the more outback you went), and food.

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I cannot recommend this cruise highly enough for people who appreciate nature at its most stunning, combined with excellent gourmet food and wine, plus friendly service. The cruise commences at 4.30pm on a tour boat which travels up the length of the first gorge, then moors while guests alight for a short walk up to the second gorge, then get on a second tour boat for the length of the second gorge. The boat then returns to the top of the first gorge, where the dinner boat is waiting with complimentary sparkling wine and beautifully set dinner tables. The tour guide was very relaxed and informative and had a brilliant eye for spotting some of the native fauna, including several freshwater crocodiles, a tortoise and many birds. Dinner is enjoyed as the boat meanders back down the Gorge as the sun sets. It consisted of an entree antipasto plate with gravadlax, carpaccio, artichokes, candied orange, semi dried tomatoes and a crocodile bisque which was heavenly!! This was followed by a lemon sorbet and mains were a choice of barramundi or beef. We chose the barra which was served with a wonderful fresh salad of roasted beetroot, pumpkin and feta. For dessert we enjoyed a creme brulee with ginger and coconut shortbread biscuit. The young chef and waitress were both lovely. We were fortunate enough to go on a night where there were only 14 guests in total, making the experience very relaxed and enjoyable. Our young waitress mentioned it can get quite hectic when they cater for groups up to 48.

If you're budget travelers like us, put on your sunscreen and spend the money for a fly net 2/$15. get on the hop on hop off bus where you pay $25 for a park pass, good for three days. Try to get there before nine am and quickly tour the cultural center. It doesn't take long. And it's not very interactive, with mostly photos and information boards and a few artifacts. Get back on the bus and go to Mala walk for the free interpretive walk at 10 am. The Rangers are interesting and give lots of info about the original residents and how they lived. The walk takes about an hour and a half, not rigorous, and then you will walk back at your leisure. That will be put you at lunch time. We packed sandwiches and filled up our water bottles at the little picnic area with toilets across from the parking area.

It’s even better now than before due I think to the controlled management and reversal back to its traditional culture. We did the early morning Marla walk with a ranger guide named Owen. He was really quite knowledgable and filled us all in as much as he could about the traditional cultures and beliefs about Uluru. We also did both sunset and sunrise photo shoots at the designated locations and again we came across rangers both times willing to share knowledge.

We were able to take very good photos and videos. We drove further and stopped at the following sites: Kuniya Piti, Tjukatjapi, Ngaltawata, Warayuki, all are sacred sites. The signage were quite confusing as there are sides left or right where photography and videography was not allowed but that really depends in which angle or distance you are taking photos or videos, nobody follows this sacred rule. We took a short walk at the Mala Walk and got closer with this natural masterpiece. There were a lot of travelers from all kinds, backpackers, seniors, independent just like us, a lot of Chinese and Vietnamese, AAT Tours, Segway motors. Everybody was anticipating for the sunrise but the sun didn’t rise this time. But it was all okay, the wild panoramic view of the mighty Uluru was enough. On our third day, we drove again to the Talinguru Nyakunytjaku Sunrise Viewing Area. It was crowded but they left immediately. What a lovely sunset and a magical Uluru. It has a different charm during sunrise and we were lucky today to witnessed this. The rays of sun through the rock was very beautiful. The patchwork of color of the rock together with the whole park was awe inspiring. A different shades of best red during sunrise.",4.1

Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It was never acceptable to climb it though? Its not like in the last 30 years the locals got together and then all decided to make up a backstory for Uluru and then declare it disrespectful to trespasse. If you thought it was okay to climb it back then, then that means you didn't do enough research into the local area, and if you didn't learn much about where you were travelling then you aren't much an 'explorer', just a tourist (which is okay by the way, I'm just a tourist to most places but I don't claim that I'm an explorer). Plus its like Geography 101 to learn that high foot traffic equals a lot of erosion, thats how natural paths can form in the space of a year along a highly travelled route. So sure it may seem like just one person walking along the rock isnt a big deal, but when thousands do, eventually that all adds up and leads to extra erosion. I agree that everyone has a different level of what is disrespectful. But that doesn't mean that your description of what is and isn't disrespectful is always right. You may not think that it is disrespectful to climb Uluru, but the natives do. And since you are in their native lands and are actively disrespecting them by climbing their sacred places, then they have the authority to declare that disrespectful. Nobody is saying that you have to believe in their gods and hold that specific rock sacred to yourself, just that you respect those who's ancestry and culture traces back millenia to that rock. You can only decide on what is disrespectful to yourself, not what is disrespectful to others. And then from there you can decide whether or not you will disrespect someone.

Wow! This isn't some boring indoors exhibition but three real life deserts replicated outdoors along with lots of aviaries where you can see birds that you would only ever see in a book actually in a natural habitat.

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Can you give me a source? There’s no doubt that crime is an issue in Alice Springs. Honestly I reckon the reason nothing has happened is because anything that could be done about the situation could also be branded as racist, so the powers that be just decide to let the people suffer rather than make people like you upset.",2.3
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited this park as a part of our rail jorney aboard ""The Ghan"" from Darwin to Adelaide. Being 'bird nerds', it was great to see the birds here, both those in displays and the trained bird show. Add to that the Nocturnal display and the flora made a great visit. We will be back.",4.5

TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),You're on the only road around. You literally drive right past the things. Do yourself a favor and pull in for a look. We got there at sunset and the pics we took were great. Camped the night for a small 'honesty box' fee of $5 or so and woke to a pretty impressive view. Some of the formations defy logic. Only downside were the flies. Bang on sunrise they were out in droves.,3.9
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We were fortunate to spend 3 days in Ayers Rock and saw Uluru at sunrise, sunset, and we walked around the base in the afternoon on a third day. Our camera doesn't do the vast array of colors justice but we have wonderful memories of this place. Our dinner under the stars was a highlight of our entire AUS/NZ trip. An astronomer lectured about the stars with a laser pointer and it was tremendous! I have never seen the Milky Way before and of course the Southern Cross was great to see. The buffet dinner was delicious and we tried new dishes. The Field of Light: Uluru is extremely unique and special. We were lucky to visit when that exhibit was still there. Thousands of LED lights of different colors come on in the desert at dusk. You have to see it to believe it. The artist, Bruce Munro is a genius. We are so glad we visited!",4.7
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Went as part of a work conference. I didn’t expect to fall in love with this place but I did. We were lead around some of the base by a geologist named Barry from AA Kings and went back for sunrise. As an Australian I can’t believe it has taken me nearly 40 years to get to the second largest rock in the world. The red earth and the spinifex grass in the morning light is beautiful. I watched from the path instead of the platform to avoid the crowd and enjoy the serenity.,4.2
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We booked a guided walking tour through the park. Our guide was a local aboriginal lady with heaps of knowledge on the Arunde culture. We saw bush food and learnt about the hard to spot animals of the desert in the 'night house', which is spectacular, even to an Aussie! The bird show was the highlight for us. Free flying birds seemed to arrive on que as from nowhere, doing small tricks that were often just amazing. Do a tour with a guide and make sure you time it to begin or end with the bird show. We loved it.",4.5
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,i have done most of the gorges on the namitjira drive and this has to be the most beautiful scenic one of them all. it is magnificent. make sure you take your camera. it is part of the larapinta trail and there are yellow footed rock wallabies in the gorge to see if you look hard.,4.9

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We visited 2 locations in Nitmiluk - Edith Falls in the afternoon on the way from Kakadu to Katherine and then we did the dawn cruise with Nitmiluk Tours the following morning. Edith Falls offers both spectacular scenery and a rare opportunity to swim right under the waterfall. We did the walk to the Upper Pool and the scenery, views of the falls and the native flora were absolutely fantastic. We enjoyed a swim in the upper pool for about an hour and you can swim quite safely right under the waterfall, although do not dive in head first as there are many submerged rocks. You need a fair bit of luck with your timing as well as a large tour group arrived just as we finised our swim and things got a bit noisy and crowded. Having stayed the night in Katherine we then headed to the Katherine Gorge section of the park to do the Dawn cruise. Again in this section of the park we were in awe of the natural beauty of the park. The dawn cruise takes in the first 2 gorges which gives you just a taste of the beauty of the area - if you have longer canoeing and/or bushwalking would be great options. There is plenty of wildlife to be seen around the Gorge carpark and visitor centre - on the day we visited we saw thousands of bats, birds and quite a few wallabies. Having just had a relatively small taste of Nitmiluk we would love to go back one day and it is defintely one of the best parks in Australia.",4.2

There are a number of well-market walking trails in the area that allows for great exploration of the site: sunup and sundown can be quite spectacular. A great overnight stop that should be included by all first time travellers to the region.",4.4
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is amazing how mesmerising a massive rock in the centre of Outback Australia can be and it is astounding how many people come to see this massive rock from before sunrise until after sunset. Generally the land around the rock is flat and so Uluru just stands with such a dominating presence. It had been 44 years since I first visited Ayers Rock and this time I was able to share the experience with my wife. Times have changed since 1973 when people were actually encouraged to climb the Rock and receive a certificate to confirm their climb. Now, out of respect for local Aboriginal people, only about 16% of people climb the Rock and this will cease completely in October 2019. Another significant change is the name Uluru being used by almost everyone, instead of calling it Ayers Rock. With fewer people climbing the rock it means more opportunity to explore the rock at the base level and I discovered a water hole, and waterfall when it rains, which I had no idea existed previously. There are sunrise and sunset viewing platforms so you can capture the different colours of Uluru. Often, just standing and looking at Uluru for a while you can see the colours change about every 15 minutes depending on the sun and cloud at the time. Uluru is a must see experience.",4.5

This was my fourth visit to the Gorge, each many years apart, but the first time I've taken the flight. What a different perspective I have now and la piece de resistance was definitely the upgrade which gave us a landing on top of the eighth gorge to take photos. Wow!

I stayed at the main hotel and was blown away as to how bad the food was i don't know where to start?? Still doing dreadful buffet service, frozen fish frozen everything, microwaved everything, dirty tables, stained carpets, staff only interested in their phones, a failed telemarketer trying to pass as a exec chef barley having the ability to defrost and microwave. Tasteless frozen store bought packaged veggies & pasta, frozen pastries?? And this is the 5 star?? Baby veg, $11 drinks and buffet service stopped trending many years ago. I talked to one of the staff while i was having breakfast i asked her why is everything frozen and canned? She said that's just normal, maybe its poor management or just a chef with no qualifications and no ability just likes wearing the hat. Then we move outside and learn there's nothing to do here why even leave the room. Sure there are a number of tours and outdoor activities but they are very expensive and expect to be surrounded by hordes of old people that do nothing but complain about the heat and only want to head back to their hotel as fast as possible.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To truly appreciate Uluru, you should do some hiking in addition to just observing the sunrise and/or sunset. To walk around the base, is a 10k endeavor. It takes about 3 hours but it is definitely worth it. You get really close-up to Uluru. We started hiking around 5:30 and ended at 8:30. The earlier you start, the earlier you finish since the temperature can get to more than 40 degrees. Make sure you wear a hat with fly net. The flies here not only stand on your hair, face, clothing but also buzz the whole way which is annoying. If you want to start hiking at 5:30am, you should find the entrance the day before when you watch the sunset. It would be difficult to find the entrance in the dark at 5:30am. The weather at 5:30 is really nice with a breeze. You would have to schedule another trip to watch the sunrise since when you walk around the base, you lose out on the whole view of Uluru.",4.1

A person details that someone was scoping their house and it turns into a massive racisit diatribe (in both directions normally) with absolutley no constructive results at all. - First post was giving a heads up, people in the area should be aware; nek minute ""The black fucks dont care about country, why should we care about them"" and there (as woth any forum) are plenty of people who love feeding the flame and just creating arguements on there. Just this morning someone posted a letter to the editor to the forum discussion TO's closing down the Larapinta Trail and it just turned into a 'who can be the biggest racist' comment chain.

At all. I very much understand the issues in Alice - and having recently left there myself with my young family not feeling very safe being a motivating factor, i have to admit that i cannot see harsher laws being the answer.

And this is what the planners had in mind - to introduce the visitor to central Australia so that they could really appreciate their visit to central Australia's national parks. The habitats that have been recreated are only part of the 'Desert Park' experience. The walk-in aviaries allow you to get close to many of the birds you will see in our national parks while in the nocturnal house you will see many species that you would not otherwise have the opportunity to see in the wild. If you plan your visit there are talks by park staff on a number of topics and you shouldn't miss the free-flying birds of prey display.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Yup! It's an inselberg, meaning that it's of a different geological composition that's harder than the surrounding land. There's a few different ways they can form but I'm pretty sure the ones here are all of sedimentary origin. Also I think Uluru is actually within an inselberg field, given there's a few others like it like the sisters (relatively) close by. Australia actually has quite a lot of them, so does east Africa and America, where they're known as Monadnocks after the native American word for the phenomena. They're also found off the coast of northern Norway and Sweden, where instead of forming giant 'island mountains', they just form normal islands.",3.6
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Was a little dubious at paying $50 for myself and the missus to enter this place... After all how good could a desert park be? I'd seen lots of desert on my way to Alice! Well my hesitation was misplaced. This place was well worth the visit and the fee. The live bird show was informative but also really fun. The presenter was well healed and had his birds extraordinarily well trained. I knew that birds of prey could be trained well, but had no idea something as common as a Magpie could be so well trained and entertaining. The Curlew was also great to watch as he strode amongst the seated crowd then returned home on voice command. The kangaroo, dingo and emu interactions were basic but I guess if you hadn't been up close with these before then it would be entertaining also. The nocturnal exhibition was second to none; loads of exhibits/animals and all well presented. The aviaries were also very well presented and you could walk right into most and get up close with many of the birds. Staff were very friendly and informative and were equally happy to educate you or leave you alone which ever your preference (nothing worse than over eager staff at these sort of places and there was none of this). Overall a great experience and well worth a visit even for those who have seen a lot of the Aussie bush and it's creatures like we have.",3.3

The amenities block was quite spacious with numerous clean toilets and showers, excellent hot water and the use of the washing machines in the laundry are free. We did the 3 Gorge tour at 9am.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This guided tour was excellent and I would recommend it for anyone interested in Uluru. Although the walking path is flat, it is important to be prepared by wearing sensible walking shoes and having water with you as it covers a distance of 11km. It is a walk that takes in all sides of Uluru and, although it was an overcast morning, the views were still spectacular. The small group started the base walk at the Kuniya Piti drop-off point. During the walk, our Macca, our guide, explained about the geological formation of Uluru, the flora and fauna we were seeing and as well as its significance to the Anangu people. We stopped at different stages so he could explain about things we were seeing and to direct our attention to many of the significant sights around Uluru, as well as pointing out particular highlights for photographs. Macca was informative and passionate about assisting us to understand the stories and the history of Uluru. Halfway through the walk we met up with our coach. The drivers were ready for us as we had a break for a hot drink. Each of us was given a breakfast bag that offered a good mix of foods and plenty for satisfying the appetite. We commenced the second part of the walk taking in the Lungkata and the Kuniya walks and the beautiful Mutitjulu Waterhole. It seemed that in no time we were back at our starting point with our coach ready and waiting to take us back to our accommodations. The lovely lemongrass scented towels offered to us were a lovely touch and a welcome and refreshing way to complete our walk. This is a great way to seek Uluru and I went back to several sections and re-walked them with a better understanding. This is an interesting experience.

All of the tours were good but we enjoyed the ranger guided walk the most, mainly because an Aboriginal guide provides the best perspective of this sacred site. Our recommendation is that Australian should visit this place at least once in a lifetime. If you are going to visit, avoid the hottest months and if you are going for a walk, the best time is early in the morning. Take lots of water, sunscreen and Aerograd!

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"What is Uluru? It’s a rock in the middle of the desert, but not just any rock. Probably the most iconic site in Australia aside from the opera house, Uluru is a large sandstone monolith described by geologists as a inselberg, or “island mountain.” It literally rises out of the desert and changes color at various times of the day and with different weather. How can it be visited? You essentially have two options: a guided tour or a self-tour. There are a number of the former options available (see my separate review of Desert Awakenings) from small groups to large buses, all with their own positives and negatives. A self-tour requires a car and admission fee to the National Park; you are then allowed to explore on your own. I guess I would add a third option of flying over it, although I’m not sure if this counts as a “visit.” Did you climb it? Um, no. There were two reasons for this: the Anangu respectfully ask that you don’t, and almost 40 people have died trying. Our guide told us several stories about hikers straying from the (non-beaten) path and breaking various bones, which was enough. How is the infrastructure around the site? Decent. There are well kept walking paths around the entire monolith (“base walk”), including a number of storyboards that highlight appropriate rock formations, fauna, flora, and rock paintings among others. A number of car parks are available for those independent travelers, along with a somewhat mediocre cultural center that really functions more as a shop for aboriginal art. Bathroom facilities are sparse. How would you recommend visiting? If I had to do things over again, I’d probably do an independent tour at sunrise around the entire base walk. Nothing would give you a better experience about the structure itself, and there’s enough information along the way to obviate the need of a guide. Things start to heat up well before noon so that’s a good time to visit the cultural center. Any other tips or advice? A full day is probably good enough for most; there’s really only so much time you can spend here. Staying out of the sun is in everyone’s best interest. As above, I’d skip the climb and consider an independent excursion.",3.1

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I took the hop on/hop off bus that delivered me to Uluru and back to my hotel. It was $50 for the day. I started with my first drop off at the Mala Walk. I would highly suggest this area. Go through the parking lot towards the rock and head left (ignore the super rude people climbing the rock and doing so right next to the signs that ask you to respect the Aboriginis by not doing so). Once you head left, you'll wander through a trail and find yourself in two different areas that have Aboriginal art. They were beautiful and the platforms take you right up to them. Please also note that there are signs along the trail asking visitors not to take pictures in certain areas because they are considered holy. I then got back on the bus and rode to the Cultural Center to walk around and see their museum - it was worth it. They also have shops and a place where you can buy paintings done by some locals (I got a small one for $60AUS). I took the last bus back, not realizing our driver, ""Snakebite"" as he called himself lol, was actually going to stop for us to watch the sunset at no extra cost.

We went at 9.30am, and saw the Flying Birds show - I won’t spoil it by giving away the secrets, but it’s amazingly good. The birds are spectacular - completely free-range and at times almost within touching distance. The aviaries enable you to see and hear a huge number of indigenous birds at close range - even outside the aviaries there seem to be flocks of finches and other birds attracted by the predator free environment. My daughter loved the dingos out lazing around, and the nocturnal exhibit is excellent. Don’t expect to see all the animals - we saw about 85%, including rare & extremely cute native marsupials.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To be able to climb Ayers Rock (Uluru) is so special, physically challenging with a sense of great achievement and an irreplaceable experience that no other activity at Uluru can offer. We were like many others, unable to climb on the first day due to wind, but were fortunate to get the green light to climb on day 2. It was by far the best part of our trip from my perspective. You cannot experience this view & the sense of awe you get from atop this magnificent natural structure which has been formed geographically as with all other historical rock formations. The fact that it happens to have formed in a land now owned by the ingenious community & governed but a small group of 12 (8 of which come from the local Anangu) seems a bit biased to me in fair decision making. I would give 5 stars if I knew that my children & their children could share in this same experience. My tip would be to rent a car, as you often need to return to the rock to see if it has opened after prior closures, as this information is not available online, nor do the resorts seem to have up to date info on it. The best time is definitely sunrise as the temperature is cooler & there are less flies & the view of the rising (just risen) sun is extraordinary (can't climb prior to sunrise).",4.0

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We booked with AAT Kings to go to the Uluru sunrise and Kata Tjuta tour and our guide and driver Stephen gave us an experience that we will never forget. Whilst the cloud cover on the day didn't allow a full array of colours to light up Uluru the sheer experience of waiting patiently for the sun to rise over such a special sacred site was memorable. The Kata Tjuta tour was no less spectacular with a walk through the Walpa Gorge with stunning views of the mountainous scenery completely surrounding us as we walked up and through the massive rock formations. We would definitely recommend everyone to do this tour.,4.4

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I like natural wonders and my two teenage children accompanied me on this expensive side trip to the Australian Outback. We bought a package from SEEIT that included a guided tour of walking Ulura and Kata Tjuta and seeing Ulura at Dusk and Dawn. The thing I liked was it was remote and not too crowded. But BRING A HEAD COVERING for the flies--they don't sting but are a pain of a nuisance and were ruining it for my daughter. My son and I barely tolerated the flies, but wish we brought our covers from Boy Scout outings. (The guide said bug spray did not work) The color changes were nice to see. I compare the adventure to seeing Old Faithful blow or El Capitan in Yosemite shine. For my teenage kids, its was a nice 'rock."" They are adventuresome, but it was their least enjoyed activity after being to Sydney and Cairns. My kids and I were the youngest people around this site. As I said, it was remote and very warm, but that was its appeal. The average age if the visitors was around 65 in my opinion, which was impressive given the walking.

Are millions of australians negatively impacted by being unable to climb a monolith just to catch a sweet view of the landscape in your view? Ayer's Rock was a symbol for all Australians, and it is deeply, horribly racist to think that only the Anangu (or Aboriginals in general) can feel spirituality about the red centre and the Uluru monolith. What you call ""a sweet view of the landscape"" is a deep spiritual connection to the country. This land is *old*, older than we can possibly understand, and we are a tiny part of it. It is awe-inspiring, and the fact that one group of people should be able to ban that for no good reason should be an affront to all Australians.

This place, while frolicking in the water, climbing the rocks, running through the dry riverbed, partaking in BBQs while trying not to be annoyed by flies...this place will always hold a special place in my heart. It has always been a favourite of mine. The water, the sand, the rocks (slippery they can be) and the scenery all round is truly amazing. There is now a lookout you can go up to on the hill, so you can gain a birds-eye view of the Gorge. I never got to do that as I didn't have enough time, but I'd end up recommending walking through the gorge and seeing it from above if you visit.

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"For the people that don't know, this is a time where Aboriginals from communities far away come to Alice Springs. Often come without any money, expecting to stay with family. They do what they do usually in communities for millennia which is to fight among each other. Stabbing each other in arms or legs. Aboriginal communities are not nor have ever been peaceful. This is not surprising since they had to survive in an extremely harsh environment . The article below is from 2008 and nothing has changed. News Alice Springs is `world stabbing capital' STABBINGS in Central Australia's tourist capital Alice Springs have reached epidemic proportions, and traditional Aboriginal thigh spearing is being blamed. STABBINGS in Central Australia's tourist capital Alice Springs have reached epidemic proportions, and traditional Aboriginal thigh spearing is being blamed. Surgeons at Alice Springs Hospital say the town is in crisis, with the number of stab injuries, blunt force injuries, bone breaks and burns admissions rising. The town now reports the highest rate of stabbings in the world, with 390 incidents for every 100,000 people. Most concerning, say the medics, is that almost 40 per cent of the stabbings were thigh injuries most likely meted out by Aboriginal elders as traditional punishment. The practice, designed to settle grievances, is performed by elders who ""have a deep knowledge of human anatomy and are skilled at spearing the femoral artery with deft accuracy,"" Dr Abraham Jacob wrote in a report published in the latest ANZ Journal of Surgery. The study shows 16 of the 605 Aborigines admitted with thigh stab wounds between 1998 and 2005 were dead on arrival. ""We found a significant and particular pattern of traditional stab injuries,"" Dr Jacob said. ""Medial thigh injury to kill, posterior thigh to permanently disable and lateral thigh to punish."" Contrary to anecdotal reports, women were just as likely to be subjected to the practice as men, and the location was town camps and homes, not streets or pubs as previously thought. Alcohol played a role in 30 per cent of stabbing admissions. About 20 per cent of the victims were admitted with stab wounds more than once, and in the same number of cases the victim absconded before they had completed treatment. Dr Jacob and his colleagues said the study was the first to reveal the extent of injury and death due to traditional spearing, saying it adds to the town's growing poor statistics. ""Alice Springs has been given the title of the crime capital of Australia, and its town camps have been described as a 'sea of despair' with conditions similar to South African ghetto townships,"" Dr Jacob said. The camps' population was expected to double in the next five years, speeding up already increasing rates of injury and death. ""Central Australia's tourist capital is in crisis,"" he said. ""A multi-pronged approach is needed, engaging Aboriginal leaders, social uplifting and economical support and education of the entire community",2.6

The entire experience was exceptional, everyone from tour guides to bus drivers, ground staff, waiters, desk staff and simply everyone we met was friendly and helpful. The place was great, the tours excellent and the whole experience just wonderful. It did cost a bit for the week, but given the remote locality and experience we were very happy with the total cost (no point going to one of the world’s greatest natural wonders and not experiencing it). The weather was hot when we were there (the day at Kings Canyon was 45 degrees), but everyone was very safety conscious and adjusted accordingly. Totally worth spending some time there.",4.5

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"To see this striking rock formation, also known as Ayers Rock and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, we recommend renting a car and driving out for the afternoon sunset, which is absolutely gorgeous. If you have time, the Park information center has an excellent exhibit that will enrich your knowledge of the area, people, and history. We would not recommend skipping the information center, as it fills in so many gaps in one's knowledge of the area. We took one of the hikes which involved about 3 hours roundtrip of moderate walking, and really enjoyed it. As the trail was rocky, sturdy shoes are recommended. There were a number of other trails to take, but we didn't have enough time programmed. If you drive around the rock, you will still get a good sense of its beauty close-up and from different angles. There is a secondary formation which is also part of the park called Kata Tjuta, and we drove out there the next morning for the sunrise view. Honestly, we didn't find it nearly as spectacular as sunset at Ayers Rock, and it's quite a drive. Friends have asked if we thought making the effort to get to Ayers Rock was worth it, and our opinion it is, but it's not a place we personally would return to. The resort in the park is adequate, but the main draw is the rock itself, some of the activities such as camel rides, dot painting, etc. which are not only fun, but help new visitors better understand the history and culture of this barren area of Australia.",3.8

One criticism - additional signage to the different zones and presentations might seem to management as excessive but from our perspective it is needed.",3.7
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Family of 5, children 8,9,11 experienced Uluru and the sites. We absolutely loved the experience, but if we were to go again, having our own car is a must and you wouldn't do any tours as you can do it all yourself! You fly in over the rock and olgas, its approx 8 min to the small township from the airport with stunning views both directions of the Katu Juita National Park. We stayed at Sails in the desert which were comfortable motel style rooms and included a buffet breakfast with a large variety and chef on hand to cook eggs etc. this is the best way to start your day and fuel up, as there is only one IGA in town which we found had a great supply but stocks were low. We purchased snacks and premade sandwiches and salads from the IGA for lunches. There is a bus to the rock daily, but we found times were limited and it was an extra cost of $50 return each trip. A national park pass is required to be pre purchased online, this is mandatory and needs to be shown everytime you enter the national park, this was aprox $65 for a family pass. We experienced sunrises and sunsets in this stunning place, definetely check the weather prior to your trip as it was 0 deg at 6.30am and then 30 deg by lunch time. Our first day was wasted as we landed at 10am and with no car couldn't get out to the rock unless we returned at 7pm due to bus times, after a 5am plane flight we weren't prepared to risk this late return. Camel tour sunrise was an experience, kids absolutely loved it, but I found it was all about them taking professional photos for us to purchase and it was absolutely freezing. We managed to be back to motel for breakfast before we headed out to the rock for the bike ride. The bike ride around the rock was our highlight, we hired bikes from the cultural centre and took off, we rode about 16km it was amazing to see it from all around, there is a water station halfway. We all climbed to the first section of the rock, it was steep and slightly harder to breath, but amazing. On return the kids took a dip in the pool, water temp was about 12deg so they didn't last long. Buffet Dinner at the hotel was great, also with a chef to prepare steaks, fish, lamb and roast how you order it. Sunrises close to 7am so quiet civilised time, so next morning we went and watched the rock come alive at a viewing point and short walk across the road from the resort. My Husband and 11 then climbed the rock, it was 45min up and about 30 down, do to the bus timetable and not wanting to be stuck there all day, they did rush, the feedback was it was very steep and dangerous, there was a section where my husband had to pull the 11 year old up whilst lying on his tummy. But the experience was amazing and they were so excited to have done it. Myself and the other two did Aboriginal Dot Art, it was about making your own story using the Aboriginal Symbols and then showing it to the group, this was an enjoyable experience. We then headed out to the Kata Juita (Olgas) which is approx 40min drive, we took the short walk into the Gorge (Silence of the Winds), there is another walk that is slightly longer, though alot of the land around is sacred and you are not allowed to go all the way around. Sunset was at a viewing area inside the national park looking at the rock, its very pretty, this is not an exclusive area and you could drive out with your wine and cheese :-). The outback BBQ dinner was next to the cultural centre beside the rock, this was just an average bbq, the highlite was the night sky and once all the lights were out, the milky way, the stars and the entire sky came to life, with a short astronomy lesson to end the evening. We loved our time out at Uluru and we would love to go back. Though as I suggested earlier if you have your own Car, you wouldn't really need to do any tours, as there is nothing exclusive about them, don't expect much of the food, Sails had by far the best food options, they are marketing everything to the tourist, but Central Australia is a long way by car, so if you can look past this and be prepared to be covered in red dirt you will have a great time!",3.9

It is important to be aware that there are several sensitive areas of the rock that you are asked not to photograph out of respect. These are clearly signposted.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We arrived fairly late in the day, so unfortunately we had missed most of the events that are on, however we were lucky to catch the free-flying bird of prey show. It was absolutely magnificent, with a very knowledgeable keeper presenting the birds and demonstrating their various techniques of flight and hunting. The birds themselves were astounding and it felt like a great privilege to be so close to them as they flew over the top of the audience. Aside from the birds of prey we also enjoyed the reptiles and the nocturnal house was a highlight too. The nocturnal animals were really active in their dark enclosures, but there is still enough light for visitors to enjoy watching them. I felt glad to be there late in the day so there were no crowds around as I watched these animals. The other outdoor exhibits though were nothing particularly special as an Australian, however I'm sure for overseas visitors the opportunity to walk through the open kangaroo enclosure would be a highlight. I don't normally have much interest in gift shops however I do have to say that the gift shop at Desert Park is very good. There are many Central Australian artworks and paintings available at very good prices. Not all the paintings were the best I've seen in the area but some of the artists are excellent, and this shop is known for ethical practise in selling indigenous artworks. To any visitors to Desert Park I would say don't miss the birds of prey show, and I would also recommend once you have been to the Desert Park drive on a little further to Flynn's Grave where the Mt Gillen walk begins (although it is not well sign-posted - you do have to know it's there) as this excellent walk will make a great finish to your day.",3.9

Add to that the bird life of the area, and you have the whole picture. It takes two or three hours to do the walks but well worth the effort and the time.",4.3

Make sure you visit this park",3.8
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"As others have said, our group got a very warm welcome when we arrived and were given maps, which were incredibly inaccurate- they showed for examples two paths from the entrance and there was only one. In the park itself, it's very clear that all the animals are very well cared for and have plenty of space. There are also great things to see, but signage is very poor to non-existent- several of us made our way to the nocturnal house, but everyone but me gave up because there was appeared to be nothing ahead of us, and no signs to say we were on the right track. Comparing notes, afterwards, not one of the fifteen of us could find the aquarium shown on the map, and there never seemed to be anyone around to ask. At one stage, I even went into a Staff Only area, as we had been round the cassowary enclosure three times trying to find the next section of the park-we were directed back to the same route so wasted a lot of time. There's huge potential but there seems to an attitude of complacency in the staff and certainly not enough staff going round to assist. Some others in my group met a party of Australians visiting, who actually apologised as they were so embarrassed ""what must you think?"" they apparently asked. When we finally got back to the centre, the café was closed. There were no opening hours displayed on the café (it was only 4pm, hardly late); not even a closed sign. It's a shame, as this could be such a great experience. My opinion is that management is at fault. I'd recommend they get in touch with Clelland Wildlife Park which knows how to do it far better-clear signs (with pictures of animals throughout the park, clear and accurate maps, and so on. I have put ""more than 3 hours"" as recommended time to visit because that includes time for getting lost several times tanks to the absence of signs and inadequate map.",2.4

We learnt about the Anangu people's connection to Uluru and the lore stories of the landscape. We also learnt about the flora and fauna.

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Issue is the education on offer isn't the kind that would help. For some reason when it comes to kids who are doing it tough, we decide education has to be so well rounded as to lose the point completely. Heavens forbid telling a kid they need to study for four or more hours a day in a world where how much you study is the most important factor in your success, and heaven forbid if you told those kids their family and culture are relying on their success. That's all too much pressure for them! Don't you know they've had it tough!? Now, every single other group doing it tough, it's fine for them. Obviously. It's how WE get ahead, but not these fragile, weak, sorry lot that need our elite wonderful enlightened guidance - ah the white man's burden sure is heavy! If only there were some way to put it down. I don't know about Alice Springs, but I know of one place where the focus is on getting the kids to go to school at all. This is ridiculous, as they're kids. You frog march the parents to the school each day their kid isn't there until they know the score, like they do with every other group. I think there are some incredibly sheltered adults put into positions of power, like magistrates and psychologists, who can't help but compare their own upbringing to these kids - but it's apples and oranges. We know what helps disadvantaged groups, but we have decided this disadvantaged group is too fragile for it, while every other disadvantaged group is obviously tough enough for it.

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I do not mean to imply that indigenous youth are necessarily more prone to crime than non-indigenous youth, hence my comment about demographics. It just so happens that the demographics of central Australia and Alice Springs mean that the poorest communities tend to be aborginal. In other parts of Australia that would not be the case. Its also true that the absolute numbers of youths committing these offence is relatively low, a few dozen at most, probably much less. The crime rates are so high because the reoffending rates are so high. For all the progress of recent decades Alice is still quite a segregated town, with some nice suburbs for the non-indigenous and a lot of poor aboriginal people. In addition, Alice is the only town of any size in central Australia and there is a very transient population of people drifting in and out from the surrounding communities for services. They tend to stay in various town camps around the town and there is a lot of violence and grog in them. In addition those central Australia remote communities are poor in a way i think most australians cannot comprehend. I used to occasionally visit some of them and i have never seen anything like it. I grew up in the working class north of England and lived for many years in London and i though i knew what poverty looked like but a trip to Yuendumu made me realise i knew nothing of what real poverty is. These places are poor like african villages are poor, burnt out cars and poorly constructed buildings. They are so remote i would certainly also develop a drinking or drug problem if i had to live there, there is almost literally nothing to do except get drunk or high. I felt like i had fell off the map. You are correct that the common thread here is poverty. The reasons for that poverty are intergenerational, multi faceted and very very complicated, but it does not change the fact that the anti social behaviour and crime in Alice Springs is predominantly, almost exclusively committed by aboriginal people. This needs to be acknowledged in the first instance before anything can be done. If you were in Geelong or Canberra or Newcastle or a hundred other towns in Australia it would not be the case, but in Alice Springs it is",2.8

The walk is over 2 hours and gets a bit tedious towards the end due to it being less interesting and further away from the rock itself (especially if you go counter clockwise). If you’re looking for a shorter walk which incorporates the most interesting parts of the rock, I’d recommend doing the Mala walk, then drive around to the Kuniya car park to see the waterhole and rock drawings, and then walking a little way along the Lungkata walk, being sure to look behind you, as this is some of the most spectacular parts of the rock.

A good bit of advice is buy a hat with a net attached or even a cork hat to keep the flies at bay . There were many trails to walk ranging in different levels from easy to hard going . Take plenty of water .,4.1

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Another stop along the Red Centre Way from Alice Springs to Uluru. The car park is about 7km from the main highway and is unusual in having a welcome refreshment kiosk and WC's. There is a short and easy walk from the car park to the gorge. When we were there in March there was some disruption as one of the paths was being resurfaced but not a big problem. If you are feeling a bit more agile you can walk off the path through sand to the other side of the pool and get a glimpse of the end of the gorge. Colours are just beautiful. Flies are an irritant so take a head net if you can. Kiosk is great for a drink and/or ice cream before hitting the road again. Highly recommended.,4.4

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was on our bucket to do list. We booked a 3 day tour with Intrepid Connections, which was actually carried out by Outback Tour services. The whole experience was better than we expected. Uluru is a beautiful landmark and landscape. For some it's a lump of rock but as a natural and geological phenomenon it's amazing. You must make sure you visit at both sunset and sunrise as the colours change, and the atmosphere around the rock change too. It's beautiful in the sunlight but it's incredible as the bright red changes to a darker red almost brown, and then lightens up again in the morning. Our tour included coach pick up from our hotel in Alice Springs. We had regular stops for coffee and toilets en route through the outback, which has to be seen from ground level to really understand it's vastness, the colour, the flat landscape and maybe even some wildlife. To stop at the 'service stations' en route is quite and experience. Good job they exist, but why would you live or work there! Our tour took us to a camel farm where we experienced a short camel ride which was great fun at 0700 in the morning! We stayed overnight in two different campsites. The facilities are very good. The tents have hard floors, campbeds, electric light and fans. They were comfortable and we slept well. Toilet facilities are good campsite facilities with plenty of cubicles and showers. Each company had a different area on the campsite. We went to Uluru for sunset and enjoyed a glass of bubbles whilst waiting. Great views of the rock and the changing colours. Then next morning we rose very early and did the 10km base walk, right around the rock, starting before sunrise and finishing in the heat of the morning - about 3.5 hours. The walk is easy as the route is flat. The views are stunning. You get fairly close to the rock itself. You are requested to respect the Aboriginal site and not take photos at certain points and to not climb on the rock. But you can get the full experience just walking around and looking at everything. You can hire a local guide, cycle round or just do it yourself. I feel the experience is better if you have a guide who can expand on the Aboriginal stories, talk about the landscape and geological formation of the rock. Our tour guide was Kelly who was great fun, and very informative. Our camp host/chef was Matt who produced some great meals on limited facilities. We were a small group (9 on Day 1 and 6 on Day 2). Kelly was happy to adapt the tour to the group to spend as long or as little as we wanted. Other parts of our tour included a visit to Kata Tjuja and to Kings Canyon. And at the end of 3 hot and tiring and fascinating days we were dropped back at our hotel in Alice Springs. Thoroughly endorse and recommend visiting Uluru, preferably with Intrepid Connections or Outback Tours. You really must go here at least once in your lifetime.",4.3
Reddit/UltralightAus,West MacDonnell Ormiston,"I reckon Larapinta is heaps better than Jatbula anyway. You can definitely have a relaxing experience on Larapinta, some of the sections aren’t too hard. If I had six days and wanted to go easier I’d probably go from Ellery Creek and hike around to camp at Ellery North then continue on to Ormiston Gorge. There’s some climbs and scrambles through that section but nothing too bad and you can have short days to split it up. Honestly when I went I camped alone at Ellery North, Serpentine Gorge and then a random creek bed in section 9. Then only two others at Hermits Hideaway. The ends of the trail and road accessible sites that have public camping for cars are busy (like Ormiston Gorge). But at Ormiston you camp away from the cars, though it still felt sort of busy. High camps are usually less busy, but they can also be less available space so you have to hedge your bets.",3.5

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"How can Uluru get anything other than 5 stars? It is an amazing natural wonder in a harshly beautiful land. As the bloke serving at the petrol station said... ""of corse its hot, it's the bloody red centre, the desert mate"". If you're there in summer like me we just planned well and went out sight- seeing during the early morning and later in the afternoon. We had a bit of a rest or a swim during the hot hours of the day. We didn't do a tour but hired a car and went around ourselves which was fine (I can't compare it to a tour as we didn't do one). This gave us freedom to do as we wish. My bit of advice would be to bring your own food if you are staying in a place with cooking facilities. There is a supermarket but it's expensive (as expected as it's remote). We flew into Alice and drove to Uluru so picked up some supplies like cereal and road trip snacks there. Happy we did :). The drive from Alice to Uluru was great actually. Interesting to see the country change and we saw a goanna, a lizard and Brumbys (wild horses). We stopped at the road houses too which was great. So the trip was part of the experience. Took about 5 hours with stopping for a meal and other stop for fuel. So pretty quick really. BEWARE though if you're hiring a car it might be limited km so they only allow 100km a day and the 25c each kilometre after that. So budget car rental is hitting me for an extra $170 for my 5 day car hire. It's called a remote charge which I think is total crap as I think it being remote indicates that unlimited km are even more necessary as people will be likely to be driving further. So just keep that in mind when planning your trip. But otherwise. Absolutely 5 stars for Uluru ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",4.3

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Good article on SBS, last year. >The reality is that Alice Springs' problems began with the forced removal of Aboriginal people from their lands. They are the result of government policies of genocide, assimilation, neglect, and then, intervention. What is driving all of this current attention and faux concern is the elephant in the room - racism. [https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/opinion-this-is-another-externally-imposed-intervention/c0d1i4buz](https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/opinion-this-is-another-externally-imposed-intervention/c0d1i4buz) My personal summary (Not unique to Alice Springs, but applicable to it). * Aboriginal people were removed from their traditional land over decades, and forced to live in ""town camps"" on the outskirts of Alice Springs (because ghettoes or shanty towns would sound bad!) * Some Non-Indigenous people have been making either overtly or coded racist statements about the Aboriginal people living in the shanty towns (let's just call them what they are) pretty consistently ever since. * Occasionally we pretend to do something which is supposed to address the ""problem"" such as the ""Intervention"". * There is also the usual background noise of ""doing something about the problem"" in the form of over policing, over incarceration, with a dash of vigilantism and sporadic outbreaks of domestic terrorism including mass arson to trying to ""burn out"". * Occasionally someone gets an insane idea such as providing employment opportunities, infrastructure, allowing people to live on country rather than in shanty towns, anything that might actually do something about crushing inter-generational poverty. Naturally they plan everything from Canberra because consulting the actual people who live there would clearly be even more insane. So they spend money on programs that achieve sweet bugger all, then say ""Oh well we tried"" and go back to just pretending not to see their fellow Australians living in third world conditions. * I am going to be downvoted to hell by people desperately not trying to say ""Well the actual problem is that all Aboriginals are some combination of child molesters>drunks and druggies>intellectually inferior>lazy>parasites here (while carefully trying to avoid using those exact words, usually).",3.3

The discrepancies are still pretty bad. As per the health index. I said the discrepancies are bad. But over exaggeration does no help. >Also its abit odd that even if its teenagers having sex amongst themselves, where did the STIs come from. To my understanding, only a few are transmitted through birth This is really interesting if you research it. The current syphilis outbreak for example in the NT can all be traved to one index case from Queensland. This person had sex with some from the the Alice Springs area approx 15 years ago. When you look at the charts and spread over that time, the syphilis outbreak literally spreads from Alice Springs upwards through the Territory jumping from community to community. One person visiting Alice Springs for example takes it back to their community and suddenly its a cluster in that community. When you see the charts you there's like a outbreak in Tennant Creek a few years after Alice, then Katherine a few years after, the Darwin a few after that. It literally snakes up the stuart highway. The Darwin strain then become penicillin resistant making things even harder. And finally from Darwin and Katherine it spread out to Arnhem land. As for how it's spread amongst teenagers? teenagers fuck my dude. The age group of 15-24 is very active. And one 24 year old has sex with a 21 year old, that 21 year old has sex with an 18 year old, that 18 year old has sex with a 16 year old, and then suddenly there's huge spread amongst the 15-16 year olds.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,">Alice gets described as much, much worse than it is. And that's because, without getting too political, Australia has an inherent bias against First nations peoples, and as such, whenever any kind of negative news comes out of places like Alice Springs, it gets sensationalized, and it feeds back into people's preconceived notions and bias. The general attitude around Welcome to Country, and the comments sections on social media following an AFL game where one took place is all the proof you need to corroborate this. We talk about reconciliation and a pathway to unity. As someone that works with First nations peoples pretty much everyday, I can tell you that we are a hell of a lot further away than most people would like to think, and it almost entirely comes down to a lack of education, awareness, and the fact that people just don't want to be educated and don't care.",2.0
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We bought the 3 day pass online (much better than buying at gate) and used it every day. One morning did the base walk at sunrise - chilly but a great experience as we took our time over 3 hours stopping at all the little cultural spots. Next day we did the base walk again - during the day when it was warmer and it was still great seeing the rock close up, with all the different colours and shapes. There are a few small sections where you need to observe the signs, respect the wishes of the land owners and not take photos. The cultural centre is also worth a visit. Also did the small men's and women's walks which had good views. One of the highlights was the sunset viewing car park - we got there about 5.30pm and sat outside with drinks and nibbles as we took photos and watched the rock and sky change dramatically as the sun went down. Great atmosphere as most people were also well set up for happy hour. Great views of Uluru from everywhere and a must see.",4.5

Next day explored the base of Uluru with a guide that told us stories and explained the meaning of the rock to the aboriginal and culture. Amazing views and experience.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Visited here with husband and 6yo child. We purchased day entry only as the nocturnal tour wasn't held on the weekends. We did however for $10 each buy an echidna encounter. The park attendant gave us a map and explained where to head to and what times. So first stop was the free flight show. After the show you could have a photo with an owl or eagle. Miss 6yo chose both and it was gorgeous. Then we wandered until it was time to go to the echidna in the cinema. This meant to could sit down and have a close look whilst the little echidna walked around and explored. The rest of the park was so well set out and the nocturnal house was amazing! The Cafe is currently closed but they have a visiting food van between 11am and 2pm. I am not sure if it's the same each time but we had Japanese and it was lovely!

We spent 5 hours there, and could have been there for a couple of more if we had got there at 7.30 am when it opened.

I'd suggest renting a car or maybe just finding a bus or something that can do one way. There are campsites and resorts etc in Kakadu as I'm sure you are aware. I'm not sure about exploring solo as I have never done it nor really have I thought about it. It's truly beautiful there and there are people around all the time at the popular spots in the parks.,3.9
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you only have one day in Alice Springs, this is the place to go to learn about the Outback. I spent all day because I went to each of the hourly talks, or you can spend less time doing a self-paced tour and not going to the shows or talks. The Noctural House was my very favorite. I also loved the talk about Aboriginal Survival in the Desert. If you're into birds, the aviaries and the bird show are very cool. The park is definitely a lot of walking but there's water fountains, shade and a cafe. The guides are amazingly knowledgeable! Go early if you want to see the dingos and kangaroos doing something other than sleeping. This park is good for all ages. The path may be too far to walk for some but the park had great handicapped accessibility for wheelchairs and motorized scooters.",4.3
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So you can spend 6 hours on a uncomfortable coaxh or fly into the local airport or a combination of both to get here. It started well with is as we were taken out for a sunset view of the rock which was very impressive. Then the next couple of days are spent looking at the thing from different angles and walks around it. Quite frankly it is all to much in unbearable heat and masses of flies buzzing around you. You are herded around like cattle, 1 tour bus following the next. Then of course you get to the hotel complex ( Yulara ) this reminded me a little of a Disney resort, every hotel is owned by the same company and as there is absolutely no where else they can go, they have got you and can charge what ever they like, and they certainly do this, as an example our hotel wanted $ 13 for a 330ml bottle of Beer and $18 for a glass of wine, that works out at around £7 & £10. There is slightly cheaper places but in general it is very expensive. I know the review is about Urulu but the overall experience was to long and to expensive.",2.3
Reddit/RitaFourEssenceSystem,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"In my GG i talked with Rita about my fears of losing my style when travelling. I tend to end up in Lost Girl mode when I’m dressing only for practicality. Extravagant was one of the keywords she gave to help me consider my style needs. This helped me create an incredibly satisfying outfit for this day trip. Situation: very long road trip to Nitmiluk National Park, hiking at Katherine Gorge and a swim at Leliyn (Edith Falls). I wanted to look bright, intentional and badass for this adventure. I planned around the purple crop, which I knew would be more comfortable to hike/swim in than a bikini top. The chunky necklace is lightweight and not fiddly. I discovered the black denim shorts aren’t great for steep climbs but they were fine for the gentler sections of the 7km trail. I was almost going to pick a no-nonsense practical shirt, but decided to go tropical instead, like some kind of shipwrecked fool wandering in the desert. The checked red cord shirt protected against the morning chill. Keywords: elemental+extravagant, intriguing+dramatic. Slide 2: welcome to Jawoyn Country. The national park is managed by its traditional owners, who have been using the area continuously for more than 40,000 years. It is known as Nitmiluk. “Nitmi” translates to cicada, luk is “place of”.

Reddit/AustraliaTravel,West MacDonnell Ormiston,"Hey guys, posted an updated itinerary.. just incase any of you lovely peeps were following lol... Planning a mad month itinerary for Oz in May 2025. I’ve gone into a lot of detail, I am just very excited! Our fixed dates are a family wedding and hopefully the State of Origin game, and we hope that the other highlights will be Barrier Reef and some time in the Outback. We are two persons for the full trip, my partner and I (30s & 40s) are reasonable fitness, like to keep busy, but also won’t be on the go at 8am every morning! We are both fine with hiking, snorkelling, like to take a lot of pictures and visit the odd museum, experiencing a bit of culture. My mum (70s) will join us for the first week in Cairns. She is also active, but given her age won’t want to be running around knackering herself out! I’d love feedback on the itinerary, specifically the following: o Cairns area: Where do you think to stay for 3rd-4th-5th? ***I have heard that Cairns and Port Douglas are good bases, but I think they are too much like resorts for our taste? ***My partner is interested in staying on Fitzroy island? But I think that would be too much of a faff to get to and from rainforest etc? One idea is to stay the first two nights on Fitzroy and then transfer to Cairns island? ***I like the idea of experience of experiencing a unique place like Cape Tribulation but I don’t know if it is too isolated for a couple of nights? ***Are we better to fly from Gold Coast / Brisbane to Alice Springs and then hire van to drive South or vice versa? oWhat do you think about the Outback section? Anyway, so here we go! • Late evening Thurs 30th June/early Friday 1st May: departure from Northeast Scotland • Late Saturday 2nd or early Sunday 3rd: arrival in Cairns • Sunday 3rd: chill & transfer to hotel • Monday 4th & Tuesday 5th: chill & barrier reef • Wed 6th: Copper Creek wilderness – Daintree discovery centre & river cruise – mossman gorge – Cathedral fig tree – eat in Yungaburra.

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Nope. This is a pathetic cop out. My ancestors were mostly Irish. I also have African ancestors who were enslaved, but that’s a whole separate topic. The Irish were the first to be colonised by Britain, and they were subjugated by the British Monarchy and the British Empire for over 800 years. I have ancestors who were murdered, raped, wrongly imprisoned, tortured, enslaved and exiled, simply for being Irish. Their land, culture and language were stolen from them, to the point where Gaelic is now considered a “dead language”. Britain has never even acknowledged the utter hell they subjected the Irish to, let alone apologised or issued any sort of reparations, despite their tyrannical reign only officially ending in 1998 (except Northern Ireland remains largely in shambles from “The Troubles” and is *still* under British occupation). My family, among millions of others, had endured over 700 years worth of “intergenerational trauma” and colonisation before the Aboriginals encountered a single European. My family is still significantly affected by what happened to our ancestors in Ireland. Britain’s reign of terror altered Irish people’s DNA, genetically predisposing the native Irish population and the diaspora to psychiatric illnesses (especially neurotic and anxiety disorders), addiction (primarily alcoholism, which is rampant in Ireland), gastrointestinal issues (due to generations of severe malnutrition), increased cancer risk, and plenty of other horrific diseases. My great-grandparents were raised by survivors of “The Great Famine”, a genocide which the British Empire instigated by poisoning Irish crops and perpetuated by stealing the crops the Irish *did* manage to grow and sending them straight to England. The Famine Queen (Queen Victoria) and other British aristocrats would stuff their fat faces with Irish-grown crops, while the Irish people starved to death. It’s worth noting the British people outside of the ruling class didn’t benefit from this, they were also oppressed and subjugated by Her Royal Lard-ness and her family pole (not tree) of ingrates. My great-grandparents recalled stories they’d heard from their parents and grandparents about watching people die in agony from starvation in the streets. The bodies of people they knew and loved were piled up everywhere. Entire villages were wiped out, to make room for British settlers. My great-grandparents grew up around people who had suffered from nervous breakdowns, because they’d been surrounded by so much death and suffering, and people who had lifelong physical health problems as a result of chronic starvation and malnutrition. Hoarding, paranoia, anxiety, anger, depression, neurosis, post-traumatic stress, emotional repression and alcoholism were just a few of the common reactions and traits among the famine survivors, and sadly these were often passed down. The bodies of several of my ancestors, who were tortured and murdered by the British, were taken to England as “trophies” and they still haven’t been returned to Ireland. Ireland has never fully recovered and we’re all just expected to act like none of this ever happened. Ignorant people constantly undermine our history and label us as “white”, despite the fact that the British coined that term and made it abundantly clear that only British people were considered “white”. But guess what? None of what I’ve just listed gives *me* an excuse to be a violent thug. Why on earth would it? My ancestors fought and survived against the odds, so that their descendants (including me) could have a better life. I’m not going to spit in their faces by being a degenerate, especially when, comparatively, I live in the kind of luxury they never could’ve dreamed of. I will never have to worry about having enough food to eat, or whether myself or my family will survive the winter. I won’t have to watch my children die from starvation in a genocide. I’m considered a human being under the law and afforded the same rights as my British peers. I have the freedom to speak whatever languages I want. I have the freedom to practice my religion and embrace my cultural heritage. I don’t live in constant fear of being exiled, enslaved, raped, tortured, imprisoned or murdered on the whims of British government or monarchy. King Chucky and his family of nonces have no power over me. They can’t hurt me in the way their predecessors hurt not just my ancestors, but hundreds of millions of other people’s ancestors too. *Billions* of people can play the “oppression card”, for so many reasons. Hell, what the British inflicted upon the Aboriginals in Australia is a footnote in history, compared to the tyranny they inflicted elsewhere. There’s no fucking excuse for what’s happening in Alice Springs. It’s time for people to step up and take accountability for their own actions. They need to actively make the choice to break the cycles of abuse and criminality and stop making pathetic excuses for thei",1.1
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Every Australian should plan to visit Uluru at least once. There were plenty of other tourists around but most of the time it felt like we were the only ones for miles. Get up for the obligatory sunrise photos and then start your walks early before the day heats up. The base walk is long but not strenuous or taxing. We didn’t do the climb out of respect for the aboriginal culture. Photos cannot replicate or do justice to the majesty of The Rock. Awe-inspiring.,3.9
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The park is so big so that you can still escape people as otherwise any non extrovert would hate it. Go hiking, esp the base walk and you will see the rock alone a lot of the time and in all sorts of light. Wonderful. Sunrise and sunsets are rarely as spectacular as the brochure photos and you will watch them with massive crowds all hoping for something remarkable. And beware the POLICE sting operating here - revenue raising at its worst. Each day we found them sitting at the base of slopes, before sunrise and after, just inside the 60kmh zones after you've been used to driving at 80kmh while entering the park. We saw them clean up nabbing drivers doing only a little over the limit. The conditions here are not dangerous and I never saw an accident, so who knows what the police were trying to save us from ..... maybe just making a few thousand dollars an hour for the government. Disgraceful.",3.4

Is it constantly letting your 10 year old walk around Alice Springs at 2am... Is that a trigger to remove them from their guardian, and why wasn't it before this curfew? What I'd love to see is a detailed grand plan by indigenous peoples on how to solve their problems that addresses the compromises that will need to happen. I've never been able to find one.

On to the nocturnal house which is a real highlight and incredibly well set out.The park is well marked out and easy to negotiate with lots of water stations along the paths. Really impressed with the little scooters that are available for those that need them. The gift shop had lots of souvenirs at good prices.

We did most of the "" associated experiences"", including The Sounds of Silence Dinner, Field of Lights spectacular and even rode a camel with Uluru Camel Tours. On a lay day we hired a car and drove out to Uluru ( about 15 Klms) where we walked the base of the rock. I chose not to climb or really go anywhere near the rock. It's sacred ground to the local community and also, extremely dangerous. There's been 35+ fatalities in the past. #320m high!! A single span chain to hold on to! Forget it. Respect the local's wishes. I witnessed families with small children, elderly Asians with cheap slippery shoes and people of every fitness level head up the rock- just because they can! So dangerous- they need to fence it off. There's no safety chains on the way up there. The ""climbers"" are eroding the rock face. This is evident by the faded rock face under the chain. The rock face appears flaky and flimsy. The oxide had changed from orange to light grey. So there's a lot of people risking their necks! The Rangers advise that there's also a health issue evolving, as there's no toilets or garbage bins up on the top, so all the rubbish and human waste is washing down into the waterholes at the base. Stay off!! From there we drove 53klms to Kata Tjuta ( The Olgas). Remarkable!! The most beautiful landscape you will ever see. The Red Centre- You have to do it! Fabulous for a short break. Will return.",3.4

The whole concept needs to be thought through again, a daily coach tour or hire car from Alice Springs that also takes you past Mount Connor and Kata Tjuta is a better way to go about seeing more for less. Re the ministers comments, Australia at large is a shit-tier tourism destination, we probably lose billions in respect to foreigners visiting the biggest cities + Uluru and not wanting to come back at all (this is also a jab at Sydney lol), attributable for some of the reasons outlined before.

Definately something everyone should do at least once in their lifetime! We started our walk in the dark around 6am and it was so quiet and peaceful but really chilly! So if you go in winter - rug up!! We saw an amazing sunrise while walking around learning about the fauna and vegetation surrounding the rock - and there is so much!! I thought it would be baron but it is quite dense and green! We also got up close and personal with the rock and saw how mother nature is engraving it over time. I was amazed at how many holes, caves, cut outs and designs are in the rock itself. You think its just going to one solid structure but its not. And the waterholes are very peaceful, pretty and soothing. The company itself was great. Amy (I think - she was a belgium girl) was amazing. So pleasant and full of information. The only thing I would suggest is to stop for breakfast a lot earlier than we did. We all thought we were going to stop for breakfast about 30 mins into the walk but it was 3 hours later! The hot water for tea/coffee was not hot anymore and we were starving by then. otherwise it was definately worth doing.",4.2

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru (Ayers Rock) is situated basically in the centre of Australia so is in a very remote location. The area has many massive sandstone outcrops of various names eg Ayers Rock, Olgas etc. These outcrops are absolutely stunning in the best lighting conditions, typically sunrise and sunset. Just the sheer size and form of these outcrops is stunning. The Ayers Rock village is the closest facility to Uluru and offers a variety of accommodation levels from camping to 5 star resort style. The are also a variety of independent tour operators who offer everything from camping style tours of the area to luxury coach style tours, take your pick. AAT Kings is the biggest operator and offers ""up market"" tours including the sunrise and sunset tours and dinners as a complete package including drinks and meals. The major airlines offer good daily connections to all Australian cities and the hotels provide free airport transfers. If you are considering driving check the distances because it is a long way from anywhere! Due to its remote location Uluru is not cheap, expect to pay at least double city prices so if you are on a tight budget plan ahead and check prices for accommodation etc. The best time to visit is late autumn, winter, early spring. If you are flying or driving suggest you definitely avoid summer due to the high temperatures in outback Australia and that some of the walks are closed if temperatures are expected to be above 36 Centigrade. Definitely recommend a trip to Ayers Rock!",4.6

It is a rare opportunity to see a number of birds of prey up close: owls, kites, hawks, eagles as well as some ""gate crashers"" small local birds like Willie Wagtail, there for the free food. Another interesting place was the nocturnal exhibit. I see they have the opportunity for a nocturnal tour which I'm sure would be fascinating but we didn't have that chance.

Jeg kunne slet ikke forstå det, for selv om der var lidt ballade på gaden (var der hver aften), kunne jeg ikke forestille mig, der kunne være så farligt i Australien. Vi var flere, der snakkede om, at det kunne da ikke passe. Det er virkelig svært som turist at fatte, for der er altså normalt temmelig fredeligt og sikkert andre steder i Australien. Men hotellet havde nok ret. Jeg oplevede ikke noget farligt der selv, men stemningen om aftenen var ikke god, kunne jeg godt mærke, og vi var mest indenfor om aftenen.",3.1
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,It takes a bit of a climb to get here but it is very worthwile....for a short time we had the pool all to ourself and we enjoyed the piece and quietness and the great view. A small piece of heaven on earth. Take a plunge to experience it. Make sure to bring food/something to drink as you will not be able to buy it. But also make sure to leave nothing behind to keep the place nice & clean for others to enjoy it as well.,4.1

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Acres of native vegetation and animals which can be viewed close up. We visited the Desert park before going bush which was really helpful in getting a handle on some of the things we might see in the bush. The nocturnal house is very impressive and so was the bird show. The Dingo display was not great I felt sorry for the two dogs on display in a very exposed yard. The shop sells excellent examples of Hermannsburg painting at very reasonable prices as well as the usual tea towels and tinnie holders. The staff at the Park are very informed and happy to share knowledge. The one draw back I could see at the Park was a very ordinary café which is not being run to its capacity. The setting demands a really great food outlet where you can get good café grub and a good coffee. The Park opens early in the morning and it is a good idea to go early to see the animals when they are active.,3.8

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We were prepared to be disappointed by Uluru but that was absolutely not the case. You cannot hep but be impressed by your first sighting as you approach by road. It is absolutely surreal. Clearly there is a risk that such a unique attraction is overwhelmed by tourists but generally this seemed to be very well managed. We were fortunate to be travelling independently with a hire car so we could choose when and where to go. Parking in the general area of Uluru is well controlled. There is a perimeter road off which there are seperate defined car parks/viewing areas for coaches and cars. Parking on the road is not permitted. Having bought our entrance ticket to the Park earlier ($25 each) we arrived at a car park an hour or so before sunset and other vehicles were already arriving. It was busy but by no means overcrowded. The sunset was maybe not as red as it could be but still very beautiful. We the took the Dawn Awakening tour from our hotel early the following morning to hear and see more with a guide. An ambition achieved!,3.0

In addition to the animals, there is a wonderful array of plant species. For me, this place, is the essence of the Australian desert.

The base walk along the track is very far away from the rock, its almost hard to see the details. But the biggest stitch up is that there aren't any toilets along the midway. What does Parks Australia expect walkers to do???? Hold it in? If the rock is a culture sensitive area, then build a toilet along the way, at least no one will be relieving themselves next to the rock. What about the children? Think about the visitor's well being and respect the place. The entrance is 25 bucks per person every day of the every year. Surely, Parks Australia can afford a septic system on the way and perhaps a drink station. Just a suggestion.",2.9

However, my 2 cents, I think people prefer travelling to SEA or Asia in general because we can travel for the same cost but live like the rich. With cost of living now I think people just want a taste of life without having to worry about $ and SEA countries provide that for us. So I think this might be stopping people.",3.3

I thought it was so offensive, but a good amount of them didn't give a damn. I agreed with the elders that those who climbed it should be stricken down by bad luck. But Uluru is something else when compared to Wollumbin, I do believe that information displays should be put in specific areas to help educate people about it.",3.5

Anything you think you know about the indigenous - you’re in for a shock, so be prepared. You’ll see a lot of things you don’t understand and can’t make sense of. I stopped doing fifo because I simply didn’t feel safe. My straw that broke the camels back was a Wednesday night, I was playing trivia at uncles tavern (awesome place, amaaazzzing waffle fries) and it was 20:45, I went out for a smoke, (and uncles tavern is surrounded by big black iron metal gates), I was standing outside, and this absolute mob of young indigenous kids (aged 8 - 12 ish) came up to me and the ringleader said “oi, give us a fckn smoke”. And I said “shouldn’t you be in bed?” And this kid looks me in the eye, and he said “give me a fckn smoke now or I’ll ram this iron gate so far up your cunt youll bleed out of your eyes like the cunt I killed yesterday”. The look in this kids eyes is something I’ll never forget. Like a cross between pure hate and just plain malevolence. So I went and got security. He just shrugged. He said “I can’t do anything, he’s indigenous, he’s untouchable”. I love Alice Springs, always will - but be safe.

While the 3rd gorge is only 700m long, the extra time allows people about an hour to have a swim in a safe area (some did), explore the art on the canyon wall a bit more (which we did) or even sunbake on the rocks - in the high tropics - at midday (those people were looking a bit pink!). The cruise provides a light snack (banana bread, a packet of nuts, a bottle of water and a mandarine) in a useful little pack. The gorge is impressive. Easy to see why it is used in so many tourist promotions. Having seen Jedda Rock, I'll have to watch the movie now. We had taken the 9am tour, so were back by 1pm.

We got off to a bad start by turning up without our 'swimmies' and with no firm idea of what we wanted to do. My advice - do some research beforehand and get your accommodation's front desk to book you on a cruise in advance (if you don't opt for the canoeing instead). We opted for the 4-hour afternoon cruise, to the end of the 3rd gorge, which allows a stop for a swim and a snack on the way back. We had to head back to Katherine for our swim gear as we did not want to pass up the opportunity to swim in the gorge! The cruise was fantastic. I thought 4 hours might be a bit long (specially for our 6-year old) but the time flew by. The scenery is absolutely stunning, and we saw a couple of harmless freshwater crocs. Due to the relatively low water levels, at the end of each gorge we had to leave our boat and walk to the next boat in the next gorge (the walking is not strenuous, about 2km in total, and you get to see some Aboriginal rock art too). At the end of the 3rd gorge we got out and climbed up the rocks to look at the vortex holes. This trip was definitely one of the highlights of our holiday in Australia.",4.4

Add more opportunities out in Alice Springs and the surrounding areas. We can throw 27 billion dollars on a peer, we can fund rural communities country wide. Build malls, hospitals, road and rail. Build things in these communities, give them hope. ***A number of local Aboriginal groups issued statements on Tuesday, many expressing concern about the potential for a knee-jerk government response.*** ***The group representing the town's Arrernte traditional owners said the current crisis was the result of Intervention policies and decades of ""chronic and systemic neglect"" of remote communities.*** ***They said Arrernte in Alice Springs had watched poverty, inadequate housing and under-investment in remote schools and health services force people to abandon their home communities and move into town.*** Which is why these communities have such high amounts of alcoholism. They aren't benefiting from the same Australia we are, instead they're left to rot. These areas need modern 21s century city planning. We need to modernise Australia, now. We can do it. We throw billions at dumb stuff constantly. ***Earlier in the day NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker said greater investment in social services, especially to remote communities, was needed to address the under-lying issues exacerbated by alcohol.*** ***Crime statistics released yesterday showed a more than 50 per cent increase in commercial break-in's, property damage and alcohol-related assault in the past year.*** ***There was a 53 per cent increase in domestic violence-related assaults in Alice Springs.*** Pretty easy to figure out in the end, why people drink and why people steal.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had hired a car as it’s so much easier to get around and ended up being cheaper than the hop on/off bus for 2 people. We got to Uluru for 7.30am. Unfortunately our visit to Yulara coincided with a heatwave which affected our ability to do everything we wanted to do. If I was to go again I would probably go around September. As we drove up to the rock we looked at each other in amazement at the sheer size of it. We had no idea how big it was and no words can describe the colours of the rock. We got so carried away with photos that it took us 30 mins to do the first km. The walk itself is not hard. It’s flat. However the heat was really bad. They say to drink 1 litre of water per hour and I can see why. The heat radiates off the sand and there is very little shade along the path. It was saying it was only 32deg at 8.00am but it felt like 40deg to me. There was a shelter around 2 kms in but no water. We had to get to the half point shelter to get water. I was surprised they didn’t have water at each rest station. Along the way there were beautiful parts to take photos but they were prohibited for cultural reasons as they were deemed sensitive spots. I think we chose the right way to go around anticlockwise as it had the nice views at the beginning like the rock art, caves and gorge. By the time we got to the end of the 10km walk I wasn’t even looking at the last couple of kms as it was so hot I just wanted to get to the end. It took us 2 hours and 40mins to finish and we were stopping to enjoy the views and took loads of photos along the way. However if you are there during the warmer months you need to start the walk around 6.00 - 6.30am as it can get uncomfortably hot. On the plus side we did not need our fly nets at all during all of our stay at Yulara. Must have been too hot for the flies and there were not that many tourists. As Australians this was a must do for us. You definitely felt like you were in the presence of something spiritual and I don’t tend to believe in that sort of thing but I can definitely understand why this is such a sacred place for the Aboriginals.",2.9

The back drop to the stage is also stunningly encompassed by mountains in the distance. There is a clear visible passion from the park ranger hosts who are quick to add bonus additional facts to the show as a number of impromptu guest appearances happen throughout the presentation with the local birdlife either popping in for a drink at the watering hole or soaring high above patrolling the skies. The nocturnal displays are yet another highlight within the grounds which have so much more to offer.",4.5
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is worth of visiting but can not be compared to King's Canyon - totally different places. Yulara resort has good services and basically caters to every budget. Sunset and sunrise are worth to see but if you wanna see the whole thing - be at time. For example sunrise you should be at lookouts before the horizon starts to change color. Going around Uluru is ok by bike after sunrise watching but if you want to walk - you should start walking before sunrise - it will be hot by 10.00 am. Plenty of water recommended to have with you!

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert park is an excellent day out. Initially the entrance price of $25 seemed a bit steep, but after 6 hours exploring the park, attending the varied presentations scheduled throughout the day, watching the beautiful birds in the many aviaries and visiting the animals and reptiles in the nocturnal house, we felt it was very good value. The free-flying bird show was particularly impressive, with one native bird after another swooping into and through the amphitheatre, and displaying themselves as the ranger provided interesting commentary about each. Close encounters of the dingo-kind was fun, and the ""Changing Heart"" movie engaging. The weather was rather hot and perhaps this is why visitor numbers were low - we only had to share the park with a handful of others, and we felt very privileged. The park is well organised, with clear sign-posting and many information boards, all set in keeping with the natural desert environment. I can highly recommend the desert park.

It is so steeped in history and the Aboriginal people have done so much with the national park to educate you on their culture, what you are seeing, and what you may experience. Uluru has so many facets and feels different at each stage of daylight - specifically at sunset at the car park and at the talinguru nyakunytjaku viewing area. These were my favorite locations because they have a very wide viewing area, so regardless of how packed it is you still get an individual experience. I did not like the Kata Tjuta viewing area (people say it isn't as crowded for sunrise) this is NOT true and the viewing platform is very small so people were climbing all over each other to get a photo. It made the experience a lot less special. One of the most unique parts of our visit was seeing Uluru after a storm!

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,Ormiston gorge is a great place to get a good feel for the West Macdonnel ranges. The camping is ground is no frills but comfy and quiet with an honesty box (coming from South Africa this phenomenon stills surprises me). The walks especially the pound walk - are fantastic. It still gets hot in winter time during the day so take plenty of water. Bird watchers will enjoy this place,4.5

The spectacular thing about the place is the flies and without a fly net you will have a very healthy protein diet. The place has history and you can get a lot of information on line. We did a short walk from Mutitjulu waterhole to Kantju Gorge and then boarded the bus back to the hotel. If doing the long walk, carry water and note the location of the toilets. Unfortunately did not feel the fascination that other tourist have for this place.

Different areas which have information boards so you can understand what you are looking at. The birds of prey show is amazing.

If ""piss Christ"" happened in place that was intolerant or hostile towards Christianity, that would be more of a problem.

There's a picture I like about equality and fairness, where it's three kids trying to look over a fence. One of the kids is tall enough, the middle kid barely can't see, and the short kid can't see at all. If you give all of the kids a step a foot tall to stand on, it helps the middle one see, but the tallest one didn't need it, and the shortest one still can't.

I grew up knowing it as Ayers Rock, but the name change has now been around so long that my first inclination is always to call it Uluru (which I think sounds much better in any case). Fraser Island was only officially renamed K'gari in 2023. So this name change hasn't had much time to sink in and become a familiar name for most people.

There are at least 2 different pathways at different heights that will give you an uninterrupted view of the rock where you won't have to jostle to get to see it. Be prepared however, for the cold blast that follows the sunrise. The temperature dropped by around 6 degrees centigrade, and even though we were all rugged up, we froze. But don't miss it.

Uluru is the tourism equivalent of a stripper - in which you can only look from a distance and touching is a crime. (Still welcome to pay money though!) A lot of their major population centers are some of the most crime-afflicted in the country and occasionally the world . (Alice Springs was briefly 17th or so globally, and Tennant Creek is nationally famous for how awful and unsafe it is.) It's a hot take but I don't know why we keep letting the NT suck up money and then sook when nothing works. The money should be diverted to build social housing and infrastructure in states that pull their own weight and desperately need the accommodation. Either that, or we get a federal intervention as every successive state government appears to be useless. The NT is some kind of Rube Goldberg Machine in which federal funding is input and crime, red sand and inflammatory news articles are the output. Darwin is basically the exception to all of this, as we needed somewhere to be the capital. But instead of being attacked by criminals you get attacked by tropical cyclones and humidity never thought possible.",2.6

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This tour picked us up at our hotel (Sails in the Desert) at 6:30 PM and, after a short drive to, we debarked and did a short uphill walk to a viewpoint where one could see both Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Had canapés and champagne ( or wine or beer) and a social session whiledwe watched the sunset over Kata Tjuta. We then walked down to dining area with fully appointed tables and an excellent buffet dinner with wine or beer included with a selection of desserts, coffee or tea and an excellent port. The lights were all turned off and we were treated to spectacular view of the heavens while an astronomer described what we were seeing. Bussed back to the hotel about 10:30 PM.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We came here a couple of times, first to do the base walk then to catch the sunset. The base walk took us around 3 hours to do and is very easy and flat. It was great seeing the different faces of Uluru and the different desert fauna. But I wouldn't call it enjoyable as it was very hot and there were lots of flies buzzing around. As we all know, Aussie flies are not civilised :) I highly recommend buying the head net that wraps around your face. This rock seems to change colour every direction you view it from. There are a few rest stops along the way, and even though there are two stops with safe drinking water, great for quenching the thirst but leaves a horrible after taste. Try to view at least one sunrise or sunset. We went for the sunset viewing and it was such an amazing experience, we had a rainbow sky with magnificent colours and you can see Uluru shimmering and seemingly changing colours as the sun sets.",3.0

Reddit/aviation,Alice Springs Desert Park,"No. I was browsing Flightradar24 one day earlier this year and noticed a line (5?) of Singapore Airlines A380s heading to Alice Springs. They have space. I believe the reason Qantas chose California for their A380s is that they have a maintenance base at LAX which isn't too far from where they're stored at Victorville. Sydney (and maybe Melbourne) airport is closed at night until 6am. Flights between the west coast of the US and Australia all follow a similar schedule: depart late in evening LA time (10p-12a) and arrive at Sydney just after opening (6-8a). This allows time for connecting passengers to arrive from across the US and accounts for SYD being closed at night. Flights from SYD to LAX depart late morning and arrive early morning in LAX, so the aircraft are at LAX for over 12 hours. Qantas decided to use this opportunity to do maintenance on their A380 and 747 aircraft and set up a maintenance facility at LAX.",2.2
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We made a dreadful decision planning our visit to Alice Springs Desert Park (ASDP). We didn't allow enough time. We were on route to the airport and decided on a last-minute visit due to flight delays. Our view was that we would have a quick visit, see everything and get out in quick time. How wrong we were. With only an hour available, we didn't do the park justice. Even though we had decent time with the nocturnal animals, dingo’s and aviary birds, it was rushed. Regarding the nocturnal house, I can also honesty say I’ve never been so close to an inquisitive brown snake. Thankfully, it was behind glass. Not sure it made me feel any better. The rushed visit also meant we missed out on animal/bird shows along with educational tours the park has on offer. We thought the kids (4 & 6) would find it a little boring, but, wrong again. Our kids LOVED it and giggled as they raced from one animal to another. I also like how they separated sections of the park to illustrate different aspects of Australia i.e. desert rivers, sand country, woodland. Really well done. If in Alice Springs and new to outback Australia, this really should be on your list of attractions. The park provides great insights on what to expect when you start to explore the outback yourself. Just make sure you allow enough time. Enjoy.",3.0

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We went in June and it was a lot colder than what I had expected on the plus side it meant I wasn’t hot and flies were not an issue. Sails in the Desert have halal meat options and we immensely enjoyed the lunch and dinner there however I am glad we stayed at the Emu apartments as we were able to mostly self cater and wash clothes. The local iga sells halal meat products and vilis pies I do not recommend the desert dining experience as most of the money is on the alcohol and the meat was not halal there. Field of light was great however I paid the extra for the star pass and again, because we don’t drink it wasn’t worth the extra. The aerial view wasn’t worth it, walking around the installation was the better part of the experience. The Camel Farm was worth the time, especially if you have children, as you learn about the contribution of Muslim cameleers plus the animals there are cute. I recommend doing at least one tour be it for Uluru or Kara Tjuta so you can learn about the formations etc but do one or the other on your own. Hire a car for $200 a day and self navigation to those sights is easy. Kings canyon is a 3 hour drive and we thoroughly enjoyed it, a tour for this would be better.

Uluru was really neat and were glad we got it off the bucket list but everything else about the holiday was a shit show. A lot of the visitors are older international tour groups as well that have still not fully resumed to normal levels. 1) flights into yalara are insane, $850/pax from Melbourne where as it was only $350 into Alice 2) Accommodation at Uluru is not nice unless you stay absolute top tier. When we went they still had a lot of the resorts/rooms unavailable to book due to staff issues. Everything took forever, room was dirty, property was not maintained. Not fun at all, felt like we just wasted so much money out of some form of ""social responsibility"" 3) Alice Springs has fallen into a police state of nightly violence and crime. Our last night there we went out for dinner walked from the restaurant to a taxi queue, while waiting watched someone stab a taxi driver in the shoulder with a pair of scissors over an unpaid fare. Guy was not even the passenger in the taxi just looking for violence. Stabber and the passenger were blind drunk at 8pm. Went on a guided 4x4 tour and spoke with the guide who grew up in Alice. In 2019 he said he moved his family to Queensland to get away from the violence, he operates the tour company with a partner now and they fly back and forth to keep the business going without having their families in Alice. He was dealing with multiple home break-ins a year, car thefts, his wife being assaulted was the final straw.",1.3

Saw all of the promised animals although the bilby was being very elusive. Everybody is issued with a headlamp to wear which is set to red light to minimise disturbance to the animals. Really the lamps were far too weak to do much more than allow you to see where you were going and you had to rely on the guides to shine their much stronger torches where you wanted to look. I would have liked a few of the better torches distributed through the group as there were many times when there were more animals around than the one the guide was spotlighting. And we were lucky as we had two guides and therefore two torches. I get the impression there is usually only one guide. Having said all that, the tour was a wonderfully different opportunity to see wildlife in its native habitat so well done to Dessert Park for coming up with the idea.",2.9

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is not possible to add to so many reviews with anything unique. So, instead, let me outline what I think a person can do in 48 hours, which is exactly the length of our recent tour. Firstly, hats off to JetStar for providing a good and reliable service from Melbourne. Uluru is approx. 3 hours away, and is more like 2.5 hours when returning. Similar for Sydney. Less for other places. So in this COVID-19 era, Australians get going - look at your own backyard, rather than waiting for other places to reopen. (I know. I sound like a TV ad, but the ads are true.) Secondly, hats off to the Sails in the Desert Hotel. I stayed at this place in 1986 when it was the Sheraton. Now, on my return visit, it has a new name and it is still in great shape. Lovely rooms. Lovely lobby and shop area. The Yulara town centre offers great short walks (a great lookout) and free cultural talks and activities. Well worth doing. The tour companies offer some very good tours. Generally it is the driver/guide who makes a tour memorable. Hats off to Sol at AAT Kings. Some members of my group went on the back of a Harley Davidson in a trike around Uluru and they said it was brilliant. Some members of my group did the 2-hour flight over all major sights in the area and also gave it a verdict of being brilliant. Atmosphere and vibe - excellent. How can you tire of admiring the red earth and all the contrasts, especially at sunrise and sunset. Lastly, even though I have written 'hats off' several times in this review, maybe a hat was not needed , but fly nets are an absolute necessity.",3.8
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We did the nocturnal tour. So you're walking aroung in the dark and you hear a lot of noices in the bushes, but we saw only very few of the animals.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We were in Alice Springs on Sunday, so the half day tour of the sights wasn't available. Decided to take in the Desert Park, but had to take a taxi. It was beautiful (though hot) and I would definitely recommend it if you have time. It's large, and beautifully landscaped in distinct areas according the ecology. The short show in the beautiful theater (air-conditioned!) on raptors was interesting - but mostly owls. (and one snake) We enjoyed the animals throughout the park, especially the Australian Bustard (a large bird) which was in full mating mode emitting clicks and roars which sounded like some sort of large wild mountain lion, and heard from a distance. His female counterpart was unimpressed, but we were. The highlight for us was time alone in the kangaroo enclosure with perhaps a dozen kangaroos. Granted they were all just hanging out in the shade, and not too active, but a couple did get up and demonstrate to us (close-up) their very silent and graceful jumps. The Nocturnal exhibit is wonderful, but we couldn't give it adequate attention, as it was getting close to closing time. If you have time in Alice Springs, I would definitely recommend a visit here, and am glad the since we weren't on a tour, we were able to enjoy it at our own pace. (I imagine a tour would limit your time there to an hour or less....) It has a great gift shop, and the attendant there was very helpful in calling our taxi for return ride to Alice Springs.",3.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It is really worth starting a walk around the rock by joining the 10am ranger guided Mala walk which starts at the Mala car park. It’s a great introduction to the significance of the rock to its Indigenous custodians. This knowledge makes it much easier to respect the no photo zones (certain parts of the rock are off limits for photography because of their significance to the Anangu people). The route is absolutely flat but can be sandy in places. As well as pedestrians you will encounter cyclists (bikes can be hired from the Cultural Centre for $50 for 3 hours) and Segway tours. There are water tanks at a couple of the car parks along the route but it’s a good idea to carry some with you. The path doesn’t hug the rock all the way round so the view constantly changes. There are some caves with rock paintings and a couple of waterholes to visit. The Cultural Centre has a cafe and well stocked gift shop that includes practical items including sunscreen and insect repellant. This is a long (10km) but easy walk that is well worth the effort.

Reddit/darwin,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Police allege the deceased man was involved in an assault on a woman at the Commonwealth bank on Gregory Terrace shortly before he entered the Coles and was confronted by security guards for allegedly putting items down his pants, when an “altercation” occurred. Mr Haig and another officer then intervened. Asst Comm Wurst rejected calls for an independent investigation into the death in custody earlier in the week, as the situation in Alice Springs remains volatile. The man’s grandfather, Warlpiri Elder Ned Jampijinpa Hargraves, said on Wednesday that he and the wider Central Australia community were “devastated by this death” and called for “answers and justice”, while remaining “in the dark about what really happened”. Mr Hargraves criticised the police for “putting out stories that portray my \[grandson\] as a criminal”, calling for all available video footage to be released publicly. “What are the police doing using such force on a vulnerable young man in a supermarket? Did they even try to de-escalate?” he said. “This happened on the fifth anniversary of death of George Floyd – during Reconciliation Week – but my people have to confront another death in custody. My people are being routinely brutalised by police. We are going to jail in record numbers – men, women and children alike. “We cannot tolerate the situation, with continued brutality and lack of respect. We will be calling for action from supporters to demand accountability, justice and self-determination. The deaths and the racism need to stop.” Political leaders have urged the community to remain calm as the investigation progresses. It is unclear what rank Mr Haig was serving in, but as a constable in 2009 was awarded a commendation for “outstanding self-discipline and personal courage” for his actions relating to a fire at a block of residential units on Kempe Street. Multiple sources who know Mr Haig described him as an “old school cop” who had faced disciplinary action in recent years for use of force and other matters. A police source said the incident is likely to be “Zach Rolfe 2.0”, referring to the shooting death of Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu during an attempted arrest in November 2019, that garnered national attention and stoked racial tensions in the Northern Territory. Mr Rolfe was charged with murder and later acquitted in the Supreme Court. Coroner Elisabeth Armitage conducted a more than two-year long inquest into the shooting death of Mr Walker and is scheduled to hand down her findings in Yuendumu on June 10, with the inquest examining the extent of systemic racism in the NT Police force. NT Courts said yesterday the Coroner was still planning to attend the community, but indicated it did not know “whether the recent events will affect these plans”.",2.8

We finally understood why because crocs can't get that far up! The climb was not difficult for those who are physically fit. Challenging for the rest but definitely manageable.

About 1.5km's, takes about 1.5hr. It has a steep first section with many steps but the view from the lookout is excellent. The second part is a more gentle slope and has no steps but is quite rough.

TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),Karlu Karlu is a fantastic place especially at sunrise and sunset but sadly this yet another great location ruined by caravenners. Driving in to the campground was like driving into a caravan show. I set up in one of the two remaining available spots (it's a popular place) and set up my tent. I was the only person in a tent there). Once night fell the tranquility of the whole place was ruined. There seemed to be a competition among the caravanners to see who could outdo each other with all manner of LED lights and light ropes shining. And then there was the noise from the TVs and radios. The facilities at the campground were find and access to the Devil's Marbles is easy. I'd love to go again to see the night sky but doubt it would be any better. Don't stay overnight if you want peace and quiet.,2.2

I attended a couple of the scheduled talks, and was particularly impressed with the woman who shared her knowledge of the indigenous foods and traditions of her people.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"At least from where i'm sitting the difference is i don't think the government should get involved in it in the first place. but im not really the person making that decision. I might not be inclined to climb it if i was asked not to, but i don't think the law should be used to stop people doing it. I think there's a bit of a grey area in this because i have the same opinion about Uluru - i think people should be allowed to climb it if it's treated with respect, and the local indigenous people should be able to ask people not to do it in the first place - out of respect. My idea of respecting it is to not throw shit around on top of it or dump garbage everywhere. But i might still want to see the view from the top. For the local indigenous people, walking on top of it *is* disrespecting it. If humans died out in a thousand years and theres no story to associate it with it anymore, it'd just be a big rock and nobody would be around to care. So who's right? People always just draw the line below what they would do. Either way, It seems like the law is a bit of a blunt instrument when it comes to this kind of thing.",2.8

I also thought the poolside food was very efficiently organised and really tasty - my steak was delicious, and perfectly cooked. We were only there for one night (would stay longer next time) and did the sunset lookout walk (steep, but with lovely sunset views) and the dawn cruise. This is a very well organised place, and a definite must visit for anyone in the Katherine area.",4.4

There is an alternate route via Kings Canyon which is a point of interest but that takes even longer - okay if you stop overnight at Kings Canyon. My suggestion is to fly in and out from AYQ, but take three days there and drive to Kata Tjuta for one of the days.

There are frequent clean toilets, ample water stations and well formed clearly marked wheelchair friendly tracks between individual attractions. Make sure you don’t miss the guided talks- we did 3 with Neil who is very knowledgeable. The free flying bird show is another unmissable highlight. “Survival in the Desert” talk delivered by a local lady is an enthralling talk scheduled for 40 minutes, but she is so interesting I could easily have listened for a few hours.

We caught local bus which doesn't take you all the way to the park and the park is set off the highway, maybe a couple of kilometres. Still it was well worth the trip.

As I said, to marginalise someone means to make them less able to do things or access basic services or opportunities. I would say that the people in and around Alice have been the opposite of marginalised. They have been given far more in assistance, be it cash, land, and housing than others. The majority have done well with that and used it to create communities, form businesses and provide for their children. We are not talking about the productive members of society though, we are talking about the trouble makers terrorising everyone else. I'm not making this a race thing either.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This a wonderful place to checkout in Australia and absolutely worth going to the middle of the country to experience it. You’ll need to rent a vehicle to get around on your own, something I definitely recommend. You need to spend at least two days to get the most out of your stay. I’d recommend seeing sunrise and sunset at each location, Kata Tjuta and Uluru, on each day. There are plenty of hiking opportunities at each location and I recommend completing the Valley of the Winds trail but keep in mind this is considered a difficult hike and you need to e sure you have plenty of water, are wearing a bush hat, and have high spf sunscreen for your body and for your lips because there is a hole in the ozone right smack on Australia. Also, at night, make sure to go outside and look up, you’ll have the amazing gift to see the Milky Way arch across the sky, an understandable reason why this land is posited with spiritual value. A last note, do not climb Uluru, although there are no laws impeding you from climbing it, just keep in mind that this is sacred land to the First Nations people of Australia so DO NOT CLIMB ULURU to afford these people respect. To give context, visitors do not climb the walls of the Vatican nor the walls of Mecca so this shouldn’t be any different.",4.5

We opted to do the Pound walk: truly spectacular: about 7km and 3-4 hour to complete: the last km or so, if you go anti-clockwise (I would recommend this) is a bit of a rock scramble through the gorge itself but well worth it. Waterholes were only found at the end of the gorge which can be easily accessed from the day-use area for those not wanting a more strenuous walk. However, this was probably my favourite day walk in the Red Centre and I think well worth the effort. Amazing rock colours in the gorge.

Get some common sense please and realise this road demands a crawl and will take an hour or more. We saw a wrecked Nissan Xtrail on the way in and a wrecked Hilux on the way out - it's that dangerous. Then there is the campground. Zero privacy and some of the worst behaviour anywhere. Multiple groups laying music loudly. Fires everywhere despite no mozzies and 30 degree plus temperatures. People illegally scouting nearby wetlands for kindling. Drones being flown. And people arriving at midnight with 4wd spotlights on. Seriously Australia, what has happened to campground etiquette? Expect the worst here, but the showers and toilets are good. Even the campground manager was resigned to expecting bad behaviour when we asked him if he could ask people to turn down their music.

There are many options, you can hire a bike and cycle around, go on a segway tour with a guide, book onto a guided walking tour or simply do your own independent walk. It's a great (and easy) walk over flat ground. It takes around 3 hours on average and has sporadic seating along the way. Make sure you fill your water bottle in advance as there are only two or three taps along the way and you don't want to get caught short.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"After a long break between trips to Alice Springs I headed back into the red centre and made what used to be an ""essential"" visit to Alice Springs Desert Park to view ""hard to find"" species and explore the once great park. Sadly the park has undergone some huge changes and has clearly lost its way and direction. The new entry area leaves so much to be desired... a vast paved heat reflecting courtyard now greets visitors as they walk past moth-balled buildings such as the original entry building which sits empty and dirty. The sense of adventure and journey has really been lost in the new entrance... feels very out of place and is a different style to the rest of the park. The park feels ""old"" and ""tired""...alot of exhibits were either dirty or empty. The once great bird collection seems to have suffered massively - with exhibit signage boards visible empty and lacking interesting inhabitants... budgerigars and other common pet shop birds filling multiple exhibits! Some new exhibits have been added (dingo, goanna and a new emu area), although like the entrance area they don't match the style of the rest of the park. The dingo area couldn't be more of a ""fenced in box"" if it tried, complete with visible dog kennels - not good at all! The new emu area was clearly built on a budget - chicken wire and start pickets... hardly a cutting edge exhibit like what the park was once known for. One pleasant addition was the new aquarium area - very good graphics and viewing of desert fish. The same could not be said for the goanna exhibit built opposite the aquarium - it seemed ridiculously overly engineered and the exhibit furnishings poorly chosen and landscaped. Guides and staff were sparse also... like the animal collection, the staff appear to have been cut back or lost altogether! The absence of staff and obvious change in management meant the education and ""story based"" experiences and strong styling that the park once had have now been lost. The Nature Theater bird display was engaging enough, but a magpie, galah and frogmouth are far from the once impressive show that featured falcons, kites, hawks and buzzards. Even the renowned nocturnal house has fallen victim to whatever has washed over the park... broken graphic displays, empty exhibits and reduction in species displayed. A venue I once would have recommended that ""everyone"" visit in the red centre has now become a ""fizzer"". I left the park feeling very down about its poor state, lack of species display and overall ""dead feeling"" it had... not the ""essential introduction the desert"" it once was. Management should have a long hard review of what the park once stood for... a clear victim of lost direction and identity.",2.1

Reddit/OldPhotosInRealLife,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Vincenzo and Maria Panebianco donated an album of old Alice Springs photos [downloadable here](https://hdl.handle.net/10070/455554) to the Australian Northern Territory Archives in 2016. I always look out for photos from hilltops with interesting views, so I found this one inspirational for a House Elf Adventure. (When I retired my missus reckoned I could be the House Elf, doing all the housework… Trouble is, I kept escaping, taking A4 prints with me on hikes and mountain bike rides and posting about it for a hobby. I had to come back a second time in 2021 to get this right, because although it had some great nightlines, I needed a tripod and some really careful looking to get it right. I couldn’t find out anything about the Panebiancos, except that they might be pilots, they flew all over the Territory, according to their photos. But this old photo stood out in that album. I just couldn’t work out who the people in the picture were. 3 years later, I found a newspaper clipping with a picture from the same hill by [Frank Hurley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Hurley), famous photographer and world adventurer. It had the same boy in it! This dates the photo at July 1935. So maybe the Panebiancos were in town at the same time as the famous Frank Hurley, and he sold them this picture. In any case, I love climbing the hills and coming back with the beaut colours of Central Australia to complement this great 1935 photo Edit: added Links",3.1

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I spent 3 1/2 days at uluru and saw most of the sights. My favourite was the uluru climb (accentuated by the fact it is a level 5/5 climb and the hard effort). Thought i share some tips with people. 1. If you are going to see the sunrise, pre-purchase the national park pass. You will get into the park quicker 2. Also, when seeing the sunrise, go as early as possible. I would recommend that you be at the gates when they open (and before), particularly if you are going to the kata tjuta sunrise place, during peak periods and when it's great sunrise weather. In early may, the gates open at 6am and the sunrise is 7:10am. The drive and walk to the kata tjuta sunrise viewpoint is at least 35 minutes (it was busy, but not a peak time when i went). The tour buses get to the gates around opening time, car queues do form and i'm sure you want to beat them to the best parts of the viewing spots. If you go to the right part of the kata tjuta sunrise spot, you can see a pretty distant uluru sunrise. If you only have time to see 1 sunrise, i would go to the kata tjuta sunrise spot. 3. The opening and closing of the uluru climb is assessed 5 times a day. 7am, 8am, 10am, 12pm and 2pm. If it is closed at 7am, it DOES NOT mean it's closed for the whole day. On the day I climbed (8/5), it was closed at 7am and 8am. It was opened at 10am. So, if you know the weather and wind forecast will improve, be patient. Similarly, the climb can be closed at any time (eg: when the wind picks up). We saw that on 9/5. The climb was open already at 10am, but by the time we walked around uluru, it was closed (2pm). Allow more than 3 hours to do the climb. The climb does not become flat after you finish climbing the chain section. The climb can get to a hands and knees scrambling or a sliding experience. 4. Best to wear shoes with non-slip soles to climb uluru. If you have hiking shoes, better still, but should have some toe flexibility. If you get hand blisters easy, gloves for the chain section is good. 6. The valley of the winds walk is rocky, unlike the uluru base walk. 7. If you are pressed for time, consider hiring a bicycle near the cultural centre and cycle around the uluru. 8. The free ranger guided walk is worth doing. I think that they try to finish by 12pm. 9. If you are lucky and happen to be at uluru at the right time and want to experience aboriginal culture, look for the notices around uluru (particularly at the cultural centre) for the open day of the aboriginal town near uluru. It is rarely open to the public. 10. In early may, there is no sun on uluru at sunrise when viewed from the official sunrise spot. The kata tjuta sunrise and the two sunset spots are great. The uluru car sunset spot is closer and better than the coach/bus sunset spot. I would recommend seeing the cultural centre. I enjoyed it. Early May has a lot of flies, so bring a flynet. Uluru is surrounded by flat plains, so it is windy. For cooler days, wear warmer clothes to counter any wind chill (particularly on cool windy days below 25 degrees or if you feel the cold). Finally, I heard whispers that once the uluru climb is closed in late october 2019, the climbing infrastructure will be pulled out. I would come back again, even if the climb is closed.",3.5

We've had friends go in with an Astra and a Corolla. The road signs recommend 4wd, and the road can be very corrugated, however just take it slow - it's only about 30km. The campground is fantastic, it has an area for those with generators, tents and campers/caravans. It also has showers and toilets which are well maintained. Fees are about $10 per adult. The waterfall is lovely and the pool at the base is worth a swim - it's quite cold though! There are a few fresh water crocs in here but they won't come near you.

So we went on a coach which dropped us off and picked us up at various places. There is a 25 Australian dollar entrance to the park which we were more than happy to pay. It being October it wasn’t that hot, a mere 33 degrees . My husband walked round the rock itself and I walked a couple of trails. The rock can still be climbed in places but we decided not to out of respect. It is a magnificent natural wonder . I would not think it suitable for kids as there isn’t much else to do although there were quite a few camper vans around and people cycling. I assume they were visiting as part of a larger road trip.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS REVIEW IS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE AAT KINGS TOUR!!! Uluru / Ayers Rock is something that everyone should go and see sometime in their lifetime. We signed up at the front desk of Desert Sands Hotel and all we got was a paper voucher/receipt and told to give it to our driver the next morning. Paid nearly $300 for the tour which looks as if we spent more than we should have paid, according to the TA pricing shown. The morning of the tour, we arrived early and were waiting in the lobby. We had bottles of water and thought we could refill from the bus as we had on the AAT Kings King Canyon tour a few days earlier. Our ""guide"" for the day had been in the lobby but never announced the tour or mentioned 3 liters of water being required for the base walk. It wasn't until checking in that the water was mentioned. We were told it was in the itinerary that we never received when we purchased the tickets. Of course we were offered the $4 bottles but ran back to the room to get some of the overpriced water we already had bought at the resort. We did a different tour with AAT Kings a few days earlier and that guide continuously announced in the lobby to all that 3 liters of water were required for the canyon tour. This ""guide"" said NOTHING! We went to a viewing area and saw the silhouette of Uluru. We were told by the ""guide"", think his name was Owen but he wore no name tag, that we would go to the rock and see the sun come up over the horizon, which we did not! Once at Uluru, Owen(?) talked a little then he was off and running. Typically throughout this ""guided"" walk, our ""guide"" was at least 100 - 200 meters ahead of us. Most of the group tried to keep up at first but were unable to take any pictures. We, along with a few others, decided to go at our own pace and get pictures. This ""guide"" sees Uluru every day. WE DO NOT! We traveled thousands of miles and paid nearly $300 for this tour so we were not running. Each time he stopped to talk a bit, he would take off running afterwards as if the tourists were an annoyance to him. He told us about sacred sites and no pictures being allowed. However, he was not clearly communicating to us about when you were able to start taking pictures again. My husband took a picture where he thought he was past the sacred area. Owen(?) called him out in front of the group and repeatedly kept saying how offended he was since he was an indigenous person. It was very awkward and uncalled for. My husband was not disrespectful on purpose. It was an honest mistake made because this ""guide"" was not doing his job. What the ""guide"" did was extremely unprofessional and could have been handled in a much different manner. He could have talked to my husband privately and asked him to delete the picture which he would have graciously done. We thought there was supposed to be so much respect for elders among the Aborigine but this person showed no respect for my husband by yelling at him the way he did. At one of the very few times we were together, Owen(?) was listening to another tour guide and seemed to get very angry and upset that this guide got some of the story/legend incorrect. He worked for another company so it was really none of our ""guide's"" business. When asked if he thought there might eventually be more commercialism of Uluru due to the introduction of things such as seaways, Owen(?) was very quick to blame the ""white man"". I believe this is a very angry young man who has no business being in the tourist industry. When dealing with the public, you need to show restraint, respect, have lots of patience and make paying customers feel comfortable. This person has NONE of those qualities. We have been traveling and taking tours/excursions for a very long time. I have always been very fair in my reviews here on Trip Advisor. This ""guided tour"" was one of the worst. AAT Kings - what are you going to do? I feel a refund is in order. Don't you agree? Don't let this review stop you from visiting this fascinating place. Just make sure that you have a good guide, not someone with such a negative attitude.",2.9

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"If you visit the NT - Alice Springs, it’s imperative that you see this amazing sight! We went around 9:30am in the morning and it was still very hot but cooler than it would have been later in the day. We missed the 7:45am bus from our hotel but had the whole bus to ourselves! This time of year the temp soars to almost 40° which makes it difficult to walk the entire base path when you have to carry a 2 yr old + camera equipment + plus a backpack full of water and snacks. One downside was the sheer volume of flies that were everywhere! Unless you take a fly net to wear over your face you will be shooing them away every 2 seconds and won’t enjoy what you came to look at in the first place. They have now stopped visitors from climbing Uluru which I feel was the right thing to do. The stories our bus driver told us about people who climbed Uluru and what they did up there is tragic and also quite disgusting. Go there and just marvel at this awesome natural wonder of Australia!

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Not being familiar with the area we found it really hard to find people who would give honest and good advise. We were told it was at least a 2hr drive from Alice Springs. It only took us 1 1/2 hrs. We were told to do the pound walk which would take 3-4 hours. We spent 2 1/2 hours on this exhausting walk in pretty ordinary landscape to find the highlight was all in the last 30 minutes. If you do the 5 min water hole walk and then walk past the water hole for a further 15 min you will be deep in the amazing ormiston gorge yet the only way they guide you to see this is to do the whole 3 hour walk in the other direction through wilderness grasslands and see this only at the end. If you love bush walking and have loads of time sure do the pound walk, but if like us you're a tourist trying to fit in as much as you can and want the highlights of just the gorge don't waste your time on this long walk through grassland. Do the water hole walk - continue walking into the gorge along the rived bed track (in the opposite direction to the pound walk arrows) and walk for as far as you continue to be amazed by the great red walls. When returning toward the water hole follow the signs up to the Ghost gum walk up to the lookout over the water hole and you will be able to cover all the highlights in 1 - 1 1/2 hours. Definitely a place worthy of a visit but the entire pound walk was a bit overkill. The kiosk is amazing food - city cafe style quality food in the remote outback. It seems a bit pricey until you see your plate - worth every cent.",2.6

First of all I would like to congratulate Damien on his presentation, he is a highly articulate and well educated young man who impressed with his in depth knowledge of central Australia's flora and fauna and how the aboriginal peoples used these in their daily life, for food, medicine and construction of tools. His sense of humour and good style left us all with a greater understanding of indigenous culture and of the deep affinity for the land that is part of aboriginal life. The stand out parts of the park for me were the walk through aviary, the nocturnal house and the bird of prey show, the only down side was that we were on a limited time as I could have spent all day there.

We then continued the Ghost Gum Walk loop which picks up the last part of the full Loop Walk. We had no difficulty wading across the river as indicated on the map but then found it impossible to get back to the other side without swimming - I felt this part of the walk was badly marked and we may have missed the correct crossing point. So we had to turn around and simply walk back the way we came. It was still a wonderful walk and we really enjoyed the views. In total, we were walking for about 3 hours. The kiosk is small but provided very tasty toasted sandwiches and a great iced coffee.",4.2
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The desert Park only unites out of Alice Springs is a place you should not miss! Plenty of parking, a kiosk and a very impressive Information and Souvenir Centre. We were given a map and shown the well defined path to take by a friendly staff member. Many of the trees were labelled and the many aviaries were a wonder. The birds we saw were amazing. We made our way around the park even encountering an emu! The Nocturnal House opened a whole new vista of the life of the Red Centre-billies, malas and Spinifex snakes and many more! Our last port of call was the Bird Display. It was brilliant to see our wild birds such as Brown Kites, magpies and close up. The Ranger who gave the display was very informative and many of the audience from overseas were captivated and awed!

Reddit/AustraliaTravel,West MacDonnell Ormiston,"We lived in Alice Springs for six years and Darwin for ten years, so of course we are rather fond of the Northern Territory. And while I think the West MacDonnell's are one of the best 100 km you can do in the country, I reluctantly agree with the others that - on a fairly short trip - four nights for the Big Three is enough (Kings Canyon, Uluru, and Kata Tjuta). If this gives you six nights in Sydney rather than four, then it's a sacrifice worth making. Make sure you don't waste those Sydney days - tourist trinkets like HOHO buses and harbour tours are totally unnecessary, as is the bridge climb in my view, but I've not done it. So your five full days in The Emerald City can cover: * Manly Beach by ferry and Taronga Zoo (on the same day, via Balmoral Beach) * Watsons Bay Ferry, Bondi Beach, Coastal Walk to Coogee, Bondi Junction * Blue Mountains day-trip (cheap train from Central to Katoomba about 7:00 AM) * Old Sydney and Queer Sydney (Domain, NSWAG, Museum, Taylor Square, Kings Cross) * I would try to fit in Pyrmont, Glebe, Balmain, Paddington, Surry Hills, and Newtown as well * The Rocks, Barangaroo, Darling Harbour, Maritime Museum, Chinatown, Pitt Street Mall That's a pretty good program.

Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"I can highly recommend part of a trip we did. We went from Darwin to Litchfield, to Kakadu, into gove (have family there) the down to Alice. From Alice we spent a day trip out to the east Macdonald ranges, then out to the west Mac's, staying at Redbank gorge, then we got bored there after 2days and went to palm valley, I loved palm valley and would say it is a must. Then there is a little town near the road into palm valley, at the local shop/servo you can buy the permit to do the mereenie loop (sort of a short cut to Kings canyon. Then from Kings down to Uluru and Kata juta. I thought Bulli rock hole at Litchfield was awesome we stay at Florence falls campground, and you could go to Bulli after all the tourist bus's have left and just about have to place to yourself. Mataranka is good for a night, the springs are better at bitter springs, but the caravan park at mataranka hot springs put on a show every night which is a nice change. Katherine gorge was good but I wouldn't go back. King canyon is a must, it's insane the scale of it, be prepared for a big walk, but it's worth it, I also thought Kata juta was better than Uluru but that's probably because it's less touristy, we did a sunset helicopter flight over both, and it was amazing. I know this is a bit all over the shop, but I will say if you want to stay at any of the public camp spots like Redbank, Florence falls, or Palm valley, make sure you get there early as the spots get filled up very early. And the private parks at Kings canyon and Yulara (Uluru) checking wait time was about an hour at both. But the water pressure in the showers at Kings canyon was worth the wait.",4.4

Bring your swimming gear as there is plenty of water to swim in and cool down on hot days.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> doesn't mean that Indigenous people don't see walking on Uluru as disrespectful. The Australian Aboriginal peoples are not a single homogenous group with a single culture, and Uluru is only ""sacred""^1 to a few tribes who happened to be in the area because their great-to-the-tenth ancestors killed off or interbred with whoever was there before them. Ayer's Rock was a symbol of Australia, for **all** Australians, regardless of race, colour or creed. No more. Now a tiny minority of a tiny minority have an unearned privilege over the rest of us. A symbolic one, to be sure, rather than any meaningful power or influence, but a privilege is still a privilege -- even if it is only the privilege to say ""No"". We (post-contact Australia) have certainly sinned greatly against the indigenous peoples of this continent. And continue to do so, e.g. the Intervention. Banning climbing on Uluru is a meaningless gesture that does nothing to improve Aboriginal's treatment, but panders to the worst parts of their pre-contact culture in a harmful way. I would hate for people to lose all contact with the ancient myths of their ancestors, but encouraging them to keep believing them is just a cynical way of keeping them ignorant and controllable. My ancestors believed a lot of nonsense too. Doesn't mean I have to. The bottom line is: do you believe that the rock actually was made by boys playing in the mud? If so, then you are too ignorant to have a say. And if not, then why encourage other people to believe something that you know damn well is rubbish? Why force others to treat these myths seriously? Why allow them to enforce sexist, racist and elitist superstitions on who can go to see what part of Uluru? Just because beliefs are ""traditional"" or ""spiritual"" doesn't make them good. ^1 I hate that word: whenever somebody claims that something is sacred, it is always a sign that some group is claiming unearned privilege over some other group. Whether it is scientologists, muslims, christians, or ancient religious, you know that some smug fucker is using it as an excuse to keep someone else in a position of subservience. You mustn't question me, because its sacred. You can't do that, because its secret men's business, no women allowed. Can't go there, because the gods will be pissed off. Don't ask us to pay tax, because we're doing gods work.",2.2

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I’ve always had a great desire to see Ayer’s Rock and I wasn’t disappointed. We booked a Deluxe Rock View room at the Desert Gardens and it was well worth it. The views from the room were great! Due to rain and lighting, the Field of Light Star tour was cancelled but the lighting show over the rock was fantastic. The following morning we went on a small-group sunrise tour with SEIT tours. We pulled off the paved road and drove down a dirt road about 3 miles near the “rock “, parked, and ate a delicious breakfast while waiting for the sunrise. Uluru shimmered red in the sun and was exactly what I was expecting. We then walked into the rock formation itself along a trail for about a half-hour. We saw the beautiful Mutitjulu waterhole being fed by last night’s rains and Aboriginal rock art. Due to the rain last night washing off much of the iron oxide (that’s what gives Uluru its distinctive red coloring), the rock was mostly gray during the day, but still very impressive. That evening we went for the sunset Sounds of Silence dinner. Unfortunately, the rain cleared out much of the dust and washed the rock so we didn’t get the magnificent sunset view you typically see in photographs. The dinner was very good and samples of barramundi, kangaroo, emu and crocodile were also served. The star show was disappointing – mainly because we saw many of the same constellations we see in the Northern hemisphere and the fact that the Southern Cross hadn’t risen yet. Between the airfare from Sydney, room at the resort, and tours, the whole trip was expensive, but in my estimation was well worth it!",3.7

Also important to note, the most common victims of Aboriginal violence is Aboriginal women and children. Yes, not all the violence and issues are within the Aboriginal community, but it's what visitors are worried about whether they say it or not.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I was there last year. The resort is nothing like what I remember from a prior visit about 15 years ago: - There's a focus on high-end experiences with high-end prices. That's fine, but it wouldn't hurt to maintain the cheaper accommodation or the campground a bit better. Everything was run down and tired, and in need of more maintenance than just a lick of paint or some watering of the grass to make it look and feel like a nice place. - There are no staff. When I was there, the petrol station was open during limited hours because the staff had other jobs cleaning rooms or running tours. Not great for the road-tripping contingent. - Everything takes forever. See above - there are no staff. Check-in, paying for fuel, getting a meal. Be prepared to wait. My Calipo melted between picking it out of the freezer and paying for it at the counter. - There is no competition and no incentive to do better - either in terms of services, prices, or amenities. - There was a weird approach to alcohol. You can't just go to a bar or restaurant and buy a beer. You need a ticket or a voucher to do so. I don't know exactly how it worked (are there per-person consumption limits?) because I didn't have alcohol with my meal, but it's not conducive to a smooth or welcoming tourist experience. - The cultural experiences are great. Expensive but great. Limited opening hours made it difficult to fit everything into a reasonable timeframe. As an aside, a friend lived and worked there as a pilot. Living conditions and ""perks"" to keep him there were slowly eroded once GPT sold the resort to the Indigenous Land Corporation. He left and now flies for an airline in Asia. Would I go back? Sure, I will, but I hope things improve a lot before then. It's not a good way to represent one of our more iconic natural wonders. My experience gels with what I had heard about it in the leadup to my (somewhat accidental - we weren't planning to be within about 500km of Uluru) trip but it was a surprise to see it for myself. I suspect the word is out that it's expensive and poor value.",2.6

The camps have appeared along the major highways and they are filthy, apparently, and an eyesore for any travellers. The trip advice is to keep driving through and stop for petrol only. In recent years the media reported the major violent outbreaks by youths and vandalism in the town that nobody could control, especially the police. Locals were calling for the military and PM to intervene. But we knew what the outcry would be from that: r-a-c-i-s-m. So the gist is to just let the town die out.

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"When I last visited the gorge in 2008, (I've been 4 times now) I was very impressed . The reception desk and ticket sales were all managed by young Aboriginal people. The cleaner was a young aboriginal girl around about 18, and there was another young girl filling the pamphlet holders. I commented to the girl on reception that I was pleased to see so many of her own people working (having seen a sign at Ularu in that same year saying the original owners employ whites - the sign disgusted me) She proudly told me that as they have been given back control of their original country they are training all their young people in every aspect of running it as a tourist attraction. The rangers were all trained up from their own young people. The young men who drove the boat and presented all the tourist information were very proud to be doing this job. The information the guide provided was almost 3 dimensional as he would say things the old people had told him. This time though I only saw white people, who seemed to be back packers. I was part of a tour so did not go into the reception area and do not have information about that section. The young while lady who was the tour guide made some comment about it being taboo for the local indigenous people to be on the water in the gorge. I find this hard to believe as only 10 years ago it was not a problem. Dishonesty irks me - if the young indigenous people don't want to do the work why make a comment about it at all. Making up things just makes them look like liars. I bet I am not the only person to have been to the gorges more than once. I am very very sad that the ideals and great expectations of the young people working there 10 years ago has disappeared. I had told many many people how wonderful it was and how the excitement and pride of these young people working was showing faith in the future - but what happened?, where is the bright future for the next group of young people. I found this very sad. One improvement I did find though was that there are now concrete steps and metal walkways over the rocks between the two gorges. It is rather taxing just the same for someone who is not very fit - particularly in the heat of the day.",3.1

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I recently visited Uluru with my grown-up son for a 3 day stay. As he was on a budget we chose our activities carefully. First of all we stayed at the Emu Walk apartments so that we could self cater and this worked well. There's an IGA in the nearby town square which had most things. I had pre-purchased our 3 day park pass and had a paper copy to show whenever we took a tour. We visited the Field of Lights on our 1st evening and that worked well. It was just enough to do after an early start to catch our flights to Uluru. We also bought a 1 day pass for the Hop on hop off bus and this also worked really well. Neither of us were fussed about seeing the rock at sunrise so opted for the 8.35 am bus instead. We got off at the Kuniya carpark and walked to the Mala carpark before heading off for the cultural centre where we caught the bus back at lunchtime. We then caught the bus again later in the afternoon to see the sunset. The next day my son went on the Seit tour to Kata Tjuta which he really liked and then we did the Cosmos Astro tour in the evening. The night sky is just amazing and seeing Jupiter and Saturn through a telescope was a rare treat. On our second evening we ate at the Arnguli restaurant as a treat and the food was delicious. We loved that they used bush spices in all of their dishes. I think we were both happy with our choice of activities and my son was super pleased that the trip had not blown his budget.,4.3

Camp fees were reasonable ($10 per person per night) and the amenities were very adequate with toilets and hot showers. Camp area is well set out with individual sites marked our and numbered and there were gas BBQs available (didn’t use them though). The sites are quite close together and fairly rocky but we were just happy to set up our tent and enjoy the quietness of being alone there. There is a separate camp area for large groups. I can’t recall now but I think that there were about 18-20 sites and it is a first come basis with no bookings taken. The whole area of Ormiston Gorge and Pound is very well set up for day visitors as well as the campers and there were works/repairs being carried out on the path to the swimming hole while we were there after heavy rains in Dec/Jan. A good kiosk is there as well for refreshments. We walked the Pound loop and absolutely loved the experience. It did take us the suggested 4 hours as at that time we had to swim and/or wade in three places towards the end of the walk due to the recent rains. We had met the lovely young Park ranger who said that the water was slowly getting cooler but we found it very pleasant. At that time of the year and after walking for a few hours it was a very welcome swim and only added to the whole experience. We had no issues doing the walk at that time of the year, leaving just before sunrise so we were back before the heat of the day. The scenery throughout the walk was fantastic and varied with some boulder sections but overall not too difficult (we are mid 50s and average fitness and had no trouble at all). There were no other visitors in the park that day so we really enjoyed the solitude of the walk. It was just beautiful and peaceful. The short walk up to Ghost Gum lookout is a must as well for a fantastic view of the Gorge. It is impossible not to take too many photos of this place - Definitely worth the visit and overnight stay !!",4.1

At night you see more stars than you've ever seen. Definitely go to Kata Tjuta too.

Seeing Uluru from one of these dunes during sunset is a magical experience. The rock rises distinctively out of the relatively flat landscape of red earth and desert vegetation. Its colour changes by the hour, and when there are some clouds, the sky becomes a magical work of art lit by the setting sun.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This park is 8 or so km west of town and is a world class desert environment park. Me and my gimpy knees arrived about 10 AM. I was surprised by the size of the park and was concerned about walking during heat of day. The staff offered to let me use one of their handicapped scooters for $10 which allowed me to see the entire park in 2 hours. Several aviaries with excellent selection of NT birds, good lizard display, walk inside the kangaroo area allowing you to get with 10 meters of roos. Good look at emus and dingoes as well. At least a dozen different types of desert landscapes presented with size and scale of each allowing you to get a good feel for them.

No official archaeological surveys were conducted during its construction, and by 1984, the site was officially protected, preventing further excavation.

TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"We stopped for the night at Karlu-Karlu on our way north from Alice Springs to Darwin. It was easily reachable in a day (about 4 hours drive) from Alice Springs. We camped in the camping area behind the rock formation - we were camped right at the base of one of the large rock areas, it was one of the most amazing campsites we experienced on our trip. The cost was low too - $3.30 per adult, or $7.70 for a family. There is a fairly decent drop toilet, and room for about 40 vans to set up to camp. There are also informative signs around explaining the history and formation of the area. At the information boards over at the day stay area there is (not very strong) free wifi. The rocks themselves are incredible. We wandered on pathways through and around the rocks and marvelled at the way they are balanced on top of each other and how varied and interesting each different stack is. There was a lot to explore. At sunset we went to the western side of the rocks and watched them turn more and more red, it was amazing. At night time the sky was clear and the stars so bright, with the rocks looming above our campsite. In the morning we saw sunrise over the rocks which was awe inspiring as well (we were lucky too and had rainbows in the sky to the west, which looked like they were rising out of the rocks). It was one of our most enjoyable and spectacular one night stops and I'd recommend everyone at least stop for a quick wander around as they drive up or down the Stuart Highway.",3.4

It shows Mr Haig on top of the much smaller person, with his knee in the area of the person’s neck, with their face on the floor outside the supermarket. It is understood the person being arrested in the picture is currently facing charges. NT Police refused to comment last night and said they would not confirm the identity of the officer involved in the Tuesday arrest as the investigation was continuing. Sources with knowledge of the situation confirmed to the *NT Independent* that Mr Haig was involved. Assistant Commissioner Travis Wurst also declined to comment about the extent of force used to subdue the deceased man or the “specifics” of what transpired during the arrest at a press conference on Wednesday, citing the ongoing investigation. Witnesses quoted in other media reports claimed the plain clothes officer put his knee to the back of the man’s neck and head before he lost consciousness, describing the arrest as “violent”. NT Police have obtained CCTV footage and body-worn video from the frontline officers involved, which is informing the ongoing investigation. “We can confirm the male was taken to the ground and remained on the ground for a number of minutes before general duties frontline officers came and placed handcuffs on the male,” Asst Comm Wurst said at the Wednesday press conference. He added it was at that time that officers realised the man had “lost consciousness”, removing the handcuffs and administering CPR until St John Ambulance staff arrived to provide care. The 24-year-old man, who had been living in a supported accommodation facility for years in Alice Springs, was taken to hospital and later declared deceased. A forensic pathologist performed an autopsy, but police have claimed the cause of death remains “undetermined” pending further investigation. ...",2.4

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,Thank you for acknowledging what non-Indigenous people constantly ignore when discussing crime in Alice Springs - much of the conflict that’s bundled under the pan-Indigenous label “Aboriginal violence” is actually inter-tribal and between groups from outside Arrente country.

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,The drive took us about 45-50 minutes in a 2wd from the turn off down the dirt track. The road Is corrugated and a little rough in a few patches but it is not too rough. Once there there are toilets and a large grassed area. The walk to the top of the falls is steep but not overly long. I think it would be a harder walk down for some as some of the steps are large. The pools at the top are amazing. The rocks in them were a little slippery so some care is needed. The pools were over head height in places but if you are not confident in the water there are plenty of areas where you were able to stand. There was a Golden tree python 🐍 on the rocks whilst we were there and someone else had seen a snake on the path near the pool. There is a pool at the bottom which has a sandy beach that gradually get deeper. The visibility is very good in the shallows so is a good spot for younger swimmers.,3.9

There are 3 pools in Gunlom, if you are not a fit person you can enjoy the first also the biggest pool under the falls. Or if you think yourself fit enough, you can walk the track and climb up to the other pools on the top. It's not a difficult walk but very steep. The water on top pools are clear like crystal and the view is just luxurious! Remember to enjoy the water flush down from top, like a natural spa.

Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> It is a sign of disrespect in the Aboriginal community to climb it. I just want to put this in a bit of historical context. The aboriginal people were the ones that originally installed the guide chains for climbing and used to encourage tourists to climb it (and get a majority share of park permit funds). This lasted for decades. The narrative of it being offensive only started to spring up in the 90s/00s. And I don’t want to discredit it and say it’s false; if they say it’s disrespectful, then it is. But, it coincides pretty strongly with a major tourism boom from another … “mainland” country with the largest population … and some tourists being generally awful. Uluru was being constantly littered with trash and plastic water bottles, as well as human waste (no bathrooms or portapotties on the long climb up). Additionally, some tourists have died or been seriously injured attempting the climb, and the aboriginals claim this causes them sadness & guilt of responsibility. I think that if tourists had always been respectful and clean, then the climb would still be open today.",2.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"At the end of recent three day trip our tour bus was just starting the four to five hour return journey to Alice Springs but came across a broken down bus from the same company. The tour company's solution was to chuck out tour group of the bus and allow the other tour group with the broke down bus to use our tour bus. Our tour would then wait at the side of the road until 50% of the people could be initially picked up and then a second, as yet to be arranged pick up would sort out the rest. So we were chucked of the bus, by the main road, in the mid day sun with no cover and our bags lying in the dirt. This was a serious safety issue. Left by the side of a busy road with no barriers to stand behind. Standing in the mid day sun and how good does it look for a company to dump passengers at the side of the road. Also makes a joke of their H&S policy - so worried about water consumption but happy to leave passengers in the mid day sun at the side of a road when it's convenient.

Reddit/geography,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Lived in Alice Springs for two years, as a backpacker working in hospitality. Landed there after traveling around Australia for two years. I fell in love nearly instantly. It's the first place where I actually saw and got to talk with Aboriginal, and got to share a bit of culture and view on life. It has been hard for me to do so before Alice Springs. However, there's a big divide between them and the ""white"" locals that was sometimes shocking, with that bar that for example had an entrance for the white and one for the black fellas, and the inside room being divided in two as well. Lots of stories of crime, and everybody there knows about someone who had issues coming back late at night. Most of the crime though is perpetrated by kids and teenagers who are lost and not really cared for by their parents, or that is at least what I understood and got from conversations. It shows the impact colonization had on the populations here. Alcohol seemed to be a big issue, and I even experienced a semi-ban on it. You'd be limited to a certain amount per person per week, and they'd check your ID every time you'd buy some. On the other hand, one of the most diverse place in terms of humans I've ever seen. Strong Asian communities, lots of backpackers, kiwis and pacific islanders, Australians both locals and from other states, queers and bogans, quirky elders and dynamic young people. But above all, and insane sense of community. Everybody being welcoming, sharing stories, giving tips and helping moving in, moving out, finding jobs or just attending regular and unregular events equally with enthusiasm. Tourists melting in every now and then for big events like Finke or the Larapinta trail winter season. The bush is beautiful, ochre red with patches of green here and there, hills and valleys. Occasional big rains will make the Todd flow for a week or so if you're lucky, and leave the outback green and verdoyant for a month or more after that. People say you're a local if you see the river flow three time actually. And then, all year long, water holes are little haven hidden between red rocks where people adventure to get a swim and escape the town for a day or two if they like camping. Honestly, a magical place that leaves no one neutral. Go there with an open mind and heart and you'll truly be surprised by the life of ordinary people there. Love and kisses to my Alice fellas",3.9

You cross the Pound and then walk down the gorge. WOW is the only way to describe it. Stunning geology, flora and views. You finish of at a lovely waterhole, with people swimming and kayaking. From there you walk up to the kiosk and have a lovely Toastie and coffee or one of a great selections of Focaccia's.

We also saw a girl get punched in the face by her boyfriend on the street. But we honestly never felt unsafe personally ourselves. Just don’t walk around after dark by yourself with belongings or do anything obviously stupid like that.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great diagram! One of my funnest ""Uluru moments"" came 14 years ago in a YHA in Halifax, NS, Canada. I was sitting in the lounge chatting with a couple from Emerald, Qld, just a normal Aussie bloke with a gorgeous wife (if I wasn't 6'5 he might've biffed me for being so friendly/flirty with her; she didn't seem to mind though), and he proudly and loudly (chortle) claimed that Australia, while a fine country, ""really doesn't have any history"". On the wall behind him was hung up a large picture of Uluru. I simply could not resist casually replying ""well, except for that big rock on the wall behind you, mate, that's been there about 100 million years"". :) English people suffer the delusion that 100 km is a long distance. Australians and Americans suffer the delusion that 100 years is a long time. ;)",4.6

Australia’s centre can get under your skin, in a good way - it’s the essence, the spirit of Australia, you will feel it. If people you hear hating on it maybe it’s because of what they heard or their own experience & I hope doesn’t put you off going. Make sure you visit Araluen the art centre & the many gorges. I lived in Milner Rd not far from Araluen. There is so much to see and do. And if you have a few days a trip to Uluru is the best. Or, if you have a lot of nrg - the Larapinta Trail. Starts from Telegraph Station. Try not to let what you have heard stop you going as it is worth the experience. You will find out what NOT to do to remain safe. Alice Springs is still the big centre of the NT & operates as that. It saddens me to hear all the bad things happening as I think it’s special. Have faith & stay safe. Cheers :-).",4.3

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Thankyou to the Bininj/Mungguy people for letting us view this park. Gunlom is a bit of a drive. If you are in the planning phase and want to do a day trip look to stay at Cooinda. It is 50km closer than Jabiru. The last 35km into Gunlom is dirt with lots of corrugations. We drove in with a small Hyundai, it is safe but can take a bit of time as you need to look at ground clearance for small rocks and smaller wheels dont soak up the bumps so well. Gunlom is so pretty. Lots of greenery while we were there in contrast with the red dust and dark rocks. We started with the climb up to the pools. Its not too steep or difficult. Lots of families going up. When you get to the top and look to drop down to the pools, look to the right. There is a path that leads up to the lake at the top. I am not sure if that lake is croc free, but we didnt risk a swim there. The pools are safe, about 2m deepest with lots of shallow bits to sit. Chilly to get in but you soon get used to it .And the views are stunning, especially after the walk up. Back down at the bottom we popped over to the small lake. Fantastic setting with clear water, small fish, white sandy beach and shady trees. We got a bit pressed for time and had to be in Darwin that night. Just for anyone interested we left Jabiru early, about 7.30 and got down to Gunlom, then drove down to Pine creek and up to Darwin on the Stuart highway, getting in about 6pm with a few stops for coffee and petrol.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Fantastic way to learn and see the wildlife of the outback and Australia close at hand. Particularly the echidna who loved our feet. The guides were both very knowledgeable and the path easy to walk. Got loads of photos of the creatures of the night. My only negative comment is that they need to maybe make an age restriction to be 7 years old and over because we had a baby and a toddler who whinged and cried for the whole hour which ruined it for us as not only couldn’t we hear the guide all the time but also it meant we didn’t get to experience the silence of the night and hear the animals rustling around in the under growth. However I would happily go again - without other peoples annoying kids. The older kids were fine!,4.3

The raptor demonstration is OK, but we found better ones elsewhere in Australia - for example at Healesville outside Melbourne. It's not worth the extra money to have your piccie taken with an eagle: the bird is one that was injured when young, and the guy who took the shots with our camera missed including us in the picture!

Reddit/theydidthemath,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Weirdly enough, there is evidence of this EXACT THING happening on Mercury! https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloris_Planitia The Caloris basin was created when a ~62 mile diameter object slammed into the planet. At the exact antipode of the impact site there are a series of hills and ridges that many scientists believe were created by the shockwaves of the impact circling the globe and converging together. https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975Moon...12..159S/abstract That being said, the ridges are on the order of 10m tall (still significant for how smooth Mercury is) so these are 35x smaller than Uluru. If we assume that the ridge size is proportional to impact energy, you would need 35x more energy than the 2x10^27 joules that created the Caloris crater, so 7x10^28 joules. The meteor that formed the Yucatán crater and wiped out the dinosaurs was only 7x10^19 joules, so you’d need a meteor 1,000,000,000 times more powerful to create Uluru. (Note that this is assuming that the seismic behavior is similar between Earth and Mercury, which is 100% untrue but gives a good enough ROM to see how absurd this would be) EDIT: after doing some additional research, it looks like energy goes as wave magnitude squared. So that means we need 1225x more energy instead of just 35x. So the total energy goes up to 25x10^29 joules.",2.5

Additional note on the Kata Tjuta trails, probably 70% of it is out in the open with no real shade/shelter. Adding to the necessity to heed the closure warnings. I ended up getting there later than I had planned, if I recall there is one lookout point where they put up a trail closure sign, then a second lookout point about another 40 or so minute hike. After that point is where you really become exposed and out of any shelter. I turned back at that point. As for the Uluru climb.

Right there should be enough for most people. Time for them to arrive in the 21st century? If you actually knew anything, anything at all about Australia you’d know that the government has at once killed and destroyed aboriginals for two centuries, and also hasn’t given the surviving communities 21st century resources. Fast internet, clean water and power are not given to most communities. Therefore most aboriginals still practise a more traditional way of life, not all of them and not all the time, but a definite section of the population. And again, they don’t want you to climb. You say they should arrive in the 21st century, kinda hard to go that when your people are stolen, killed, relocated, underfunded and oh yeah, genocide. Finally, again proving you don’t know anything at all, the tourism around Uluru is massive, camping grounds, luxury hotels, charter planes and buses to the site, restaurants, gift shops and car parks. It’s all owned by whites mainly, who used their resources (resources the aboriginals don’t have) to establish the tourism elements. Most aboriginals would want to make money of off Uluru, (but not by letting people climb) but again cannot do that cause of how they’ve been treated historically. So we have a group of extremely disadvantaged people, who are holding onto a singular religious site of great importance.

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"I visited in the hot and humid of 38 degree in temperature in the month of March, thus there are few places were closed. Disappointed but the trip though long - pickup at 6am and return at 9pm same day as I did a day tour, rewarded with the beauty of nature. We visited the cemetery which was well kept, did an adventurous dip into Edith Falls also known as Leiyn for 20 minutes - the water was lukewarm and refreshing, There are some other tourists as well as local with children swimming in the same place. The cruise through the gorge was spectacular, the sunlight shine onto the rock and it varies in different shades of yellow, orange, brownish,grey. Along the way we saw crocodiles - not much and are smaller in size (i think it is due to the hot weather that they are lying low), birds of various species, flora such as lotus or perhaps is water lily as i cannot differentiate them, lots of other white, pale yellow flowers, busy taking pictures and video, and Yes wallabies and cluster of bird nest on the underlying of the rocks. The shadow of the trees and fauna on the water surface really amazing, it looks so clear yet the water seem calm and deep, the view is simply stunning especially for someone who comes from a city country. We too sighted a water buffalo and the guide did a good job on the history of the park, the names of flora and fauna, etc it is indeed a trip with increase knowledge. Would like to return for another visit during the cooler month. Thumbs up.",3.0

Reddit/australian,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"Fair enough it's a fed govt agency so the fine is ultimately paid by tax payers. So us tax payers are really asking Parks Australia North, PAN to do better. But there is a lot more nuance to the whole saga. Markham senior was a friend and work colleague for many years, we talked this issue though quite a few times. In the first instance the various sites had been well mapped and Anthropologicaly certified. PAN knew and had all that information. They did follow consulting process re location of the proposed walkway, impact(s) and cultural sensitivity. Then they went ahead and had it constructed in the wrong location contrary to what had been understood. More to it but that is the gist of it. M Markham and families were put under considerable pressure to keep Gunlom falls, campsite open, but with the track closed. But a very important point had to be made and a precedent underlined and set in stone. So no deal. Topend and Katherine region tourism suffered, operators had to redesign itineraries etc etc. BUT first nations people and the custodians had full support from the vast majority of tourism interests. As an aside, the only reason PAN is the 'governing' body in Kakadu is because of its world heritage status. Elsewhere in the NT it's parks and wildlife. An outstanding group of professionals with excellent trust and rapport with first nations people. So quite a few of the first nation's groups in and around Kakadu are not happy, comfortable or really trusting of PAN. Note World heritage status was not something that first nations custodians asked for. Government of the day pushed it ahead. It's a good thing in many ways, but PAN well maybe not so much.",2.9

Went out at night to a few restaurants and bar/cafes. Went to the shopping strip. The Sunday Markets, OldTimers Markets, Todd River Race. A fabulous, worry free holiday. Everyone chilled. I was waiting for all the fear and terror to strike us that our racist media have promoted for others political advantage. Didn’t see any evidence. Not many Nomads which made parking easier as they suck in the same racist BS media that PHON and Murdoch use to flog their wares. Life still tough for many indigenous Aussies. Lack of jobs for young kids makes it hard for indigenous youth. Loved seeing the many aboriginal men and women selling their art at the many events over the time we were there. We came back with a great portfolio of canvases. My 24 year old niece doing a placement there for 10 weeks. She’s enjoying the environment and the challenges.

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We did a few of the hiking trails in one go and it was stunning scenery but thought I would review with a few tips. It’s all self guided and there are tons of maps around the car park so it’s quite hard to get lost as long as you stay on the paths; there is also public toilets and plenty of room for picnics so ensure to bring a backpack with snacks and heaps of water as there aren’t a lot of water pumps around there that I could see. Also bring a hat coz even though we went in dry season, it does get really hot as there isn’t much shade (being the Aussie bushland). We hiked up to the Baruwei lookout which is breathtaking and well worth the climb, just be a aware for little kids and older people - it’s very steep and you have to really take your time so ensure to wear enclosed shoes and keep hands free. Once up there, plenty of places to sit and enjoy the view and take some amazing photos - there isn’t any fences though so small kids keep a hold of. We then followed the trail around to southern rockhole - now this trail is fairly easy but again for kids / older people I wouldn’t recommend unless fit. Sounthern rockhole you literally have to climb down rocks and a lot of it is loose so be careful and wouldnt take kids under 5 down there. The waterfall was dry when we went as it is dry season but imagine it would be stunning in wet season! Still nice to sit and relax before the climb back up but wouldn’t swim there as the water is stagnant. Not far from the rockhole is “pats lookout” which is worth the extra little climb as you can see the whole gorge! Amazing place for photos and to enjoy some food. Just make sure to take all your rubbish as there are bins at the car park! There a lot of longer trails but those two were enough for us! Just watch your footing and ensure to wear thick socks as you end up walking a lot more then planned. Highly recommend for the adventurous!",4.3

The bird show at 10am was great, you get to see the birds up close, they fly a foot above your head.The seating is covered so you are not out in the blazing sun. Walking through the roo enclosure is awesome. In America I don't think any zoo would allow folks to walk in the enclosure with the roos due to lawyers, but here, there is no fence between you and the kangaroos. They allow you to get within 10 feet or so. We sat in on the aboriginal culture talk with one of the staff. I normally stay away from these, as they are boring and hard to listen to a person drone on.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Okay, first of all, the very important stuff: Kata Tjuta (The Olgas) and Uluru (Ayers Rock) are in the same vicinity, (about 58km apart by road) but both are around 6 hours' drive from Alice Springs (around 500 kilometres). That's six hours' drive out and six hours' drive back; and you need to take breaks along the way. This is something many people don't know and it's not readily advertised. It's just not the next suburb over from Alice Springs, it's a very, very long drive and if you stay for the sunset spectacular at Uluru you won't get back to Alice Springs until around midnight; driving the road at night is dangerous due to wandering cattle and wildlife. Thankfully there is fly-in fly-out and accommodation options for Uluru now. The next most important piece of information is to take or buy a fly net to put over your hat. Even if you go in the Australian winter there are flies; not as many as in summer, but they are still very annoying and will try to get into your mouth, ears, eyes and nose to get protein. Yuk! Now for The Rock. You can walk around it; if you have a guide you can hear Aboriginal stories of how various caverns and caves in the rock were used; what certain formations mean or you can just sit and admire the beauty of the rock at sunset. From October 2019 the rock will be closed to people walking on it. Until then you can climb up one side of the rock, there is a huge chain to help you part of the way, but it isn't recommended and it is considered disrespectful by the traditional owners. It's somewhere every Australian should visit at least once to gain an understanding of the vastness and beauty of our country. It is in the middle of a desert though and I would recommend visiting in the Australian winter months as temperatures in summer can reach 40+ degrees; that's 40+ celsius folks or 104F.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It's complicated. On one hand, they are legitimately reeling from the Stolen Generation trauma. It is not easy. The people who were displaced turned to substance abuse as a method to cope. This has a flow-on effect. Abuse within communities happens. The Australian government's just taken a backseat and refuses to get involved in the fears of being seen in the same light as the same apartheid freaks that ran the Australian government. I remember reading an article where an Indigenous elder was in support of completely banning alcohol altogether around Alice Springs, but the government was like 'Nah we'll look genocidal.' Indigenous cultural values also differ vastly from Australian expectations. There needs to be a reconciliation. Young Indigenous boys aged 12 drop out of hogh school because they become 'men'. Again, no offense to them but I'm Muslim - we technically become men once we hit puberty or we reach the age of 15. Same thing applies with Judaism, but 99% of us reconciled it with the Australian rule of law that states a person reaches legal adulthood when they turn 18. Something has to give.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru has more tourists than Antarctica... but it's about as close as you can get without freezing to death. Although it does get pretty bloody cold at night in winter. Definitely go in winter, because while temperatures can drop below freezing at night it's still likely to be hot during the day. You do not want to be there in mid summer. You don't even want to be there five months before/after mid summer. There will be a few tourists at the rock itself, but not many. And drive 30 minutes away and you'll be on your own with only dingoes to keep you company (they're pretty shy - we only ever saw footprints throughout our campsite each morning). Protect your food and rubbish like you would in bear country and you'll be fine. You will want to hire (or buy) your own car to avoid crowds - obviously if you take a tour bus to Uluru there will be a busload of tourists wherever you go. Flies are annoying but they don't bite - mostly they're just desperate to find water and will drink the water directly out of your eyes if that's the only water they can find. They are very sensitive to temperature and the temperature will vary massively from one hour to the next, so it won't be all day. Just certain times of they day. You can buy a mesh flyscreen that goes over your hat and covers your head. Definitely buy those, I only wore mine for about 30 minutes a day but it was life saver during those 30 minutes. Uluru is definitely the stunning thing in the area but there are countless other almost as amazing things within a couple days drive and it's worth spending a month or two in the area if you can afford to take your time. The other attractions are less well known and often you can drive an entire hour on a major highway without seeing another human. Cell phone coverage is non-existent. Make sure you have lots of water (enough for days) and a [Personal Locator Beacon](https://beacons.amsa.gov.au/about/beacon-types.asp) because a broken down car or unexpected rain can be a life threatening emergency in that part of the world. Your travel insurance will pay for it if they [send a helicopter](https://www.lifeflight.org.au/record-rescue-year-for-mt-isa-lifeflight-chopper-crew/) to save your life. The ""royal flying doctor service"" was founded in that part of the world and with a PLB you will be protected by the best air rescue system in the world. They rescued 7,349 people last year - an average of 20 per day in a thinly populated part of the world. It's a very real threat, so take it seriously. Even Bear Grylls cannot survive out there on foot. They dropped him off somewhere much safer for his Australian Man vs Wild episode. All in all, it's one of the most special places I've been in my life and I can't wait to go back. The touristy guided walk around Uluru is absolutely worth it, you'll hear stories about how people lived there a hundred years ago. Pretty amazing stuff, given how hard it is to survive.

We learned a lot when we attended the daily presentation at the cultural centre. The Mala walk with a park ranger was also very informative. At the cultural centre you can see local artists and buy beautiful paintings at Walkatjara gallery (in my opinion more options than at the gallery in Yulara). We don’t buy much when we travel but we are taking home a beautiful dot painting. There’s also a small cafe and shop with purchases supporting the local community.

(Legally, I have no idea - I'm speaking from my moral intuition rather than a legal standpoint). I don't have any problem with people having ceremonies in a national park. Hell, I got married in one. The problem I have is that religious beliefs get to dictate whether people have access to an area that is otherwise a national park. Maybe Uluru should be private land and not part of a national park - I don't know! Then again, I think about how I would feel if the Catholic church fenced off a creek in my local national park, because they'd used it for baptisms in the past. I'd be furious, and I think a lot of people would feel the same.",2.8

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"The whole of the West MacDonnell ranges are remarkable in their beauty. The Larapinta trail, an item on my to do list stretches for 223kms along the range. Camping at Ormiston Gorge allowed me to sample just a little bit of it. The campsite is quite large and was very busy due to school holidays but had good toilets and showers and a cafe with yummie coffee, run by a lovely young couple. Sadly because of a lightning storm which led to fires; across the landscape can be seen desolate parched land which is slowly regenerating. However, the views are still quite beautiful in particular around the Gorges. We also stopped at Ellery Big Hole for a view but the campsite there was full. It’s recommend you book well in advance at peak times. Immerse yourself if the West MacDonnell ranges. You won’t regret it. Absolutely gorgeous.",4.3

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This is a wonderful place to start your central Australian holiday. It gives a wonderful insight into the animals and birds that inhabit this harsh environment. You need a few hours to take it all in and wander around the beautifully maintained paths and gardens. It was an extremely hot day when we visited but as it was at the end of the day a lot of the wildlife was active as I would imagine earlier in the day it would have been too hot. Plus I think we were the only people visiting - we didn't see anyone else.,4.5
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Going there is a one in a life time experience. The place has a big importance in the aboriginal culture, and you should do the walk with the ranger (every morning at 10am and it is free) to understand it better.

Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"How about if the people who lived there call it sacred, we restrict it? Does time matter? No. If a commune in the middle of [insert western city here] arose tomorrow and declared their shared garden space to be sacred, then I would be inclined to say ‘fair enough’ and respect that. Uluru is not a ‘natural feature’ that has an inherent economic value like a forest or clay pit. Instead, it’s value comes its aesthetic power and also its history. As others have noted, the peak of Uluru is not a stunning viewpoint, so climbing it purely existed to facilitate some desire to climb a rock (a very natural and human obsession) and also give to ‘do’ at Uluru- there ain’t much else out there to keep tourists around. So while I agree with your premise that the Earth should be managed with consideration. However, I feel the wants of outsiders are greatly less important than the wants of people who live there. If the Aborigine leaders wanted to monetise and allow climbing, fair play. If they want tourists to stop treading on their sacred rock, equally fair.",2.5

There are enclosures with dingoes, emus, kangaroos, perentie, bustard, a good nocturnal house and then lots of bird enclosures to walk through. My kids were not that interested in all the birds. The movie is quite good, we didn’t catch it this time as it is only shown on the hour, every hour. But check it out if you are there at the right time.

The surrounding area is exquisite. Just beautiful. But it doesn’t make up for the stress of living there. Many are lifers and love it. This is just my experience.

Great views of the surrounding ranges from the park - lots of photo opportunities and great wildlife. Prolific birdlife both in the walk in aviarys and free flying around the park. The nocturnal house allows you to see those elusive animals like bilbys, numbats, owls and more. The bird show is truly amazing. There is a café with reasonably prices food and drinks so staying the day is easy. Also dotted around the park is free cool water for refilling bottles to just to sip. Ranger talks are included in admission fee so all in all it's great value. Loved it and will go back for sure",4.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is a great weekend away. I must admit my expectations were pretty low and I was amazed by Uluru and left a huge fan. We had an amazing weekend exploring the national park and both attractions Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Both are must sees. Uluru has a great base walk that takes about 2-3 hours and is flat. We did the walk straight after sunrise to beat the crowds and it does get cold at some points when the rock is blocking the sun. Watching the sun break through the rock was pretty amazing. Kata Tjuta takes about 40min to drive and has less people and is beautiful. We did the two main walks valley of the winds and the gorge - approx 1 hour each and they were just stunning - highly recommended. Recommend this area for a picnic as it's a lot quieter than Uluru. I'd highly recommend using the designated sunrise and sunset viewing areas, getting a spot for sunset about 2 hours before hand (if watching from the car) hiring your own car to drive around at your own pace, bringing alcohol into uluru ($38 a six pack of beer), bringing lots of water it's really dry, and bringing a picnic into the park.",4.4

You can go for a Camel ride just like the early pioneers did and go and embark on an unforgettable journey through red dune country with Uluru in the background, you can have visit one of Australia’s most spectacular open-air restaurants set under the brilliant skies with magnificent a magnificent view of Uluru and you can also pay a visit to the Cultural Centre in the National Park for an introduction to the local Indigenous culture and traditions.

Reddit/australia,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge),"I love the outback too and never find it boring so can understand why you find it appealing. I haven't done the Nullabor yet (next year) but there seems to be heaps of things to see along the way. I would download Wikicamps (it's worth the price) to find campsites and points of interest. On the highways, it's easy enough and plenty of mobile phone service most of the time or enough traffic if you are in a spot without it you can flag for help but if you go off road I would recommend taking something like a Zoleo (don't necessarily need a sat phone). You can suspend the service when you no longer need it. You could probably do most of what you want without going offroad. As far as a route you could do Melbourne (haha I am biased as I live there so all my trips start there) to Twelve Apostles to Adelaide to Lake Hillier to Perth (Rottnest Island) to Broome to Nitmiluk to Darwin to Daintree then through Cairns on your way down to Brisbane to Three Sisters/Sydney then fly home from there. A rough plan on google shows this is about 136h of driving. This skips Uluru though it's more inner Australia and out of the way. You could always go to Uluru from Nitmiluk then to the Three Sisters across to Sydney and work your way up to Cairns and Daintree through Brisbane (another 46h driving then you have to figure out where to go to fly home after that if you didn't want to back track much, maybe fly to Brisbane and go home from there). Uluru adds a significant detour so it is awkward to fit it in tbh. I LOVED Uluru (particularly Kata Tjuta) though so definitely recommend it. It is not bleak and dangerous along the Stuart Highway to get there but I would avoid driving from dusk onwards as risk of animal strike is high (dingos, wedgetailed eagles, roos, cows, occasionally a camel makes an appearance as well). NT and outback SA have been my favourite trip places. If you do go through the inner part places I liked that aren't too hard or desolate are Palm Valley, Mereenie Loop, Kings Canyon (my favourite walk ever), Flinders Ranges, Coober Pedy (weirdest town ever), Birdsville Track, Ooodnadatta Track.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,I stayed in the youth hostel a few years ago as it was low season and I did a sunset and sunrise trip so I didn't think it was worth the extra £100 for a private room for a few hours.

The whole 'resort' is linked by a free bus so you can go to the shop or restaurants in the other hotels but the bottle shop was on the YH site so we had plenty of visitors. It was a 10 minute walk across to the other hotels. There was also live entertainment at the YH and a huge kitchen where you could keep your drinks cool and cook if you wished. The pool was OK but isn't what you go there for although you are allowed to use the facilities at all 'resort' properties.

We did arrive at least an hour before sunset and just scooped up the last space in the lot. Be sure to bring your fly nets and chairs, as you get there early and have to wait. Another couple there had a little picnic which was a nice touch to eat some snacks and watch the sunset. The rock really does flow orange in the setting sunlight - truly spectacular to see the before and after pictures. One note - if you're arriving in Yulara by plane from the south (we came from Melbourne), sit on the left side of the plane for a view of Uluru and Kata Tjuta from the plane, which was also special. Really glad we went to the outback to experience the beauty here.",3.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A nightlight of our trip was exploring the Red Centre. So much to see including Aboriginal culture. We spent time at Uluru and Kata Tjuta. September was a good month to go as it was not overly hot and the days were clear blue cloudless sky's. good times to view both are at sunrise or sunset but all day gives you different perspectives as the desert is ever changing. Spring is a great time to view wild flowers and we were told this year was the best for 20 years. Colours were varied and the desert was packed. Envy got to encounter a snake across a path.

Reddit/friendlyjordies,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Lived evidence. I have spent most of my life living in high Aboriginal population areas including remote Northern WA. The issue of child abuse is absolutely well known and documented, it is absolutely tragic when kids literally 11 or 12 commit suicide and the police investigating knew they were being preyed upon but couldn’t do anything about it. I haven’t had experience of living around Alice Springs but from what I see there is no reason to assume the issue would not be prevalent there as it is in other failed communities. Also, an issue is that obviously very well meaning people straight away condemn any white person raising the issue as right wing or a racist. While obviously these people exist, a very large number of people who raise the issue do so out of genuine care for the children in harm’s way. If you’re interested I suggest reading about Roebourne in WA, nearly every child had been preyed on but little could be done to protect the kids. Over 50 know pedophiles are still in the community, still getting mindlessly drunk and taking their filthy urges out on either their own kids or kids of parents too drunk or drugged to care , or who just accept it. The truth is held down by these blind calls of racism that prevent real action.",2.2

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Went to the rock recently with a friend and was soooooo surprised at how much this place effected me. The sheer size of this rock was amazing. something about it i cant put my finger on. Make sure you do the sunrise and sunset look as the rock looks different at all times of the day.I climbed it and still had the same respect for the local indigenous people but they recommend not to. I think its just a OHS ploy not to get you to climb a dangerous rock. If you do wear good footwear it can get slippery and you don't have any second chances if you slip. If you like a quiet beer each night take plenty before you get there as take ways cost me $41 for 1 six pack. ILL BE BACK WAS AMAZING PLACE,2.4

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Pretty sure you would only get called racist if you singled out the issue by race rather than address the underlying root issue. Now the underlying root issue may be related to racism. But it’s a similar conversation to ghettos in the United States. “Why are prisons overwhelmingly populated by black people? Is it because black people commit more crimes?” To which the nuanced answer is, perhaps there is systemic racism in the laws or the application of the laws or the people in charge of enforcing the laws. As for the issue of Alice, I think it’s pretty obvious that there are systemic issues that could be fixed through better public services, better public programs and addressing wealth inequality while also rehabilitating and educating at risk and repeat offenders. But any time you try to have that conversation you get bombarded with “we keep just throwing money away and nothing is happening” it’s because things take time, and every program gets watered down and argued on and defunded until nothing CAN be done and we end up with huge inefficiencies and expensive messes. One well funded well organised and well structured initiative could fix the issues facing Alice Springs, and it certainly wouldn’t involve just incarcerating a bunch of people and calling it a day.",2.5

His diary notes tell us this was the day his 5th child was born, just over a km away down the Todd River, at the Telegraph station. His kids had a great time here, riding horses and going on adventures. Thomas was a quiet bloke who preferred a book to a picnic but if he did go out he brought his camera, a wooden Thornton Pickard camera. He applied to go back to Adelaide after a few years but they made him stay for 8. He got a holiday after 5 years though. He made several hundred photos of the early years here, a wonderful historic record. His youngest daughter was born when they returned and had to listen to her siblings recount their adventures.

It is an awesome sight to see changes colour from different angles but the red rock in the sun is the iconic view. Kata Tjuta or the Olga's are nearly as awesome some people we have talked to found them more so than the rock but to both of us Ayers Rock was the best part of our trip that included Cairns an Port Douglas that were both good but this was better. We did a helicopter flight of both the rock and Olga's which I'd rate very highly. Also walked around the rock was too windy to climb the rock apparently fates shut and warnings not to.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You raise an interesting point. Indigenous peoples throughout Australia relate to sites, landscape features, waterways, ocean, sky, plants and animals in a very different way to non-indigenous people. You seem to associate higher cultural values with the built environment than natural features. Conversely indigenous people see the built environment as ephemeral and less relevent than the country and especially features like Uluru that have persisted in their stories and their environment for many millenia. Think about some of humanities most iconic and ancient built structures, like the pyramids that are probably less than 5000 years old and how much heritage human cultures have and continue to associate with those structures. Now imagine you consider yourself a disciple (for want of a better word) of the land and a structure like Uluru has been a place of reverence for your people for at least 10,000 years and perhaps over 50,000 years and your culture has passed down knowledge/stories associated with that 'rock' for hundreds of generations.

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Of course it didn’t. There’s an incredibly strong body of evidence about the social determinants that increase the vulnerability of children to abuse and neglect and the NTER worsened every single one of them, *while also* decreasing a number of other metrics of quality of life. The NTER was an abject failure both in its stated aims and in broader social consequences outside its identified scope. The only metric by which it *did* succeed, from the perspective of the federal and NT governments, is that substantially more NT land is under government control than before 2007. I understand why users of this sub have a vested interest in ignoring the negative impacts of the NTER on the population of Alice Springs and the rest of the NT but I have absolutely no idea what you hope to gain by pretending you think it was a well designed piece of policy in any way fit for its stated purpose",1.7

Great attempt at developing natural habitats. Read many negative comments about the cafe but decided to go anyway. We shouldn’t have although the chips were quite ok.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is stunning and the pictures don't do justice to the varied landscape around the rock including hidden caves and valleys. So it is definitely worth taking a tour to walk around the base. There is a 12km track. In theory it can be done solo but our guide knew all the interesting spots. It is also worth going at sunrise or early morning for the colours and also because it's cooler. The trail is closed if temperatures rise above 36 degrees so check before going.,3.7

Reddit/RareHistoricalPhotos,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The clothes in the dingo den were found because a British tourist fell off of Uluru (known as Ayer’s Rock long ago) and landed near the dingo den several years after Azaria was snatched, while her mother languished in prison. They found the den and ultimately Baby Azaria’s clothes when retrieving the tourist’s body. The whole “A dingo took my baby!” event was very revealing and unfortunate. It showed the vicious mentality of the general public and the media. Baby Azaria’s mother was convicted in the court of public opinion long before she was convicted in a court of law, with significant help from the media and law enforcement. As for evidence against the Chamberlains, a chemical that shows blood lit up under the front dash of the car they took to Uluru, but later (AFTER Lindy Chamberlain was convicted) it was revealed that the chemical also lit up for the insulation/sealing product that the car manufacturer sprayed along the body of the car, including under the dash… But at the time, nobody (except _some_ Aborigines) believed that a dingo would or could steal a human baby and successfully run off with it. Yet in the years after this happened, there have been a few concrete cases showing very clearly that YES, dingos absolutely CAN, and if desperate/hungry enough, might try to steal a human baby or a toddler. In one such case, a father had to (successfully) fight off a dingo who was dragging his toddler away… The movie “A Cry in the Dark” (titled “Evil Angels” in Australia) with Meryl Streep and Sam Neill is a great movie about the Baby Azaria case. It shows how everyone turned against the mother, all because the media fueled the strong belief that a dingo could never, ever, have done what the mother claimed, heh. Oh, and Meryl did a great job with her fake accent. :) Of course now we know they were all wrong. Ultimately, Lindy Chamberlain was released from prison, and all charges were overturned/dropped for her and her husband in 1988, but it took until 2012 for a Northern Territory coroner to finally agree that Baby Azaria was in fact killed by dingos… And to this day, the phrase Lindy cried out after she saw a dingo run out of the tent with her infant child, is still famous: “A dingo took my baby!” And at least now we know it was the actual TRUTH…",3.3

A bit like the changes to decimal currency in 1966 and metrication in the 1970’s, it probably takes 20 years of consistent use to become the preferred term in society. Decimalisation stuck because it was a 1 way change. Metrication laws had a 10 year sunset clause and straight after, I noticed a snap back to inches and feet by some older Aussies.

There is a world of different desert environments each housing plants and animals housed in their habitat environment. There are many varieties of birds which nest and fly around in the park and also can be found in habitat enclosures. The nocturnal area was outstanding. We saw 4 presentations out of many more that are at the park, 13 in total. These included the free flying birds show, and 2 talks by Jeremy about indigenous survival in the desert and indigenous plant medicine. Jeremy was captivating , funny and extremely knowledgeable. Both his talks made our day. We spent 6 hours at the park as there are many shows to see. Start early if you want to see them all. Opens 8am.",4.6

For those without the time or inclination, the shorter walk into the gorge is lovely and shows off the trees and the gorgeous rock formations and colours. It is possible to take a dip in the pool, but be aware that it can be very cold in the cooler months. In winter the flies can be a nuisance but a flynet keeps them off your face. We were surprised to find a small kiosk/cafe there so enjoyed a quick morning tea. Walkers on the Larapinta Trail were enjoying a treat there too.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is a review of the Uluru Base Walk (rather than Uluru generally). Of the three walks we did while at Uluru (other others being the Kings Canyon Rim walk and the Olgas Valley of the Winds walk), the Uluru Base Walk was the least impressive. It is incredibly impressive being so close to Uluru, however once you get used to that, the rest of the walk is quite mundane. A large portion of the walk (the first half) is far away from the base of Uluru, and largely unshaded. I did enjoy the variety of bush flowers along the track. In my view, the best part of the walk is between the Mala carpark and the Kuniya carpark (the Lungkata walk). It's close to the base of Uluru, and you are surrounded by beautiful gum trees and birds. If you aren't sure whether you want to do the full Uluru Base walk, I'd recommend completing just this section. The walk is between 10-11 km, and took us 2 1/2 hours to complete. This included a fair amount of photo time, and a detour to Kantju Gorge. We started at a moderate pace, but by the end we were a bit tired (and needed to get back to Ayers Rock Resort to make our scenic flight), so quickened up the pace for the last section.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Enjoyed many hours out here today. Started with the bird show which was excellent. The wild birds are fascinating and you really get an appreciation of how they live in the wild. The highlight of the day for us was the Survival in the Desert presented by Jeremy. He was fantastic and really gave everyone an understanding of Aboriginal culture including the different tribes and languages, the hunting and gathering, what the bush offers, the tools and how they were made and used, the tastes of the bush and also Aboriginal law. Jeremy is passionate and sincere about his culture and it showed today. The park also hosts many other exhibits including birds, dingoes, kangaroos and an extensive nocturnal house which is brilliant. There is also a theatre showing a documentary on the history of the land and a nice cafe. The park is very well priced, I would put aside at least 4 to 6 hours to enjoy what’s on offer. I disagree with some other comments relating to the entrance price. I think it’s very good value for money.",4.2

Alice Springs does have a lot of challenges but generally is safe. I have visited many many times and have many friends who have and continue to live there. There are high rates of petty crimes like break, enter, steal. There are a lot of assaults but often these will be domestic in nature or persons known to each other.

If you are relocating with an employer they are definitely best placed to advice on recommendations on where to live and who to contact if they aren’t organising accommodation for you.

It is split into 3 different zones showcasing the various different desert environments found in this part of the world. It is home to a great diversity of different large animals, birds , reptiles and insects some of whom are greatly endangered or already extinct in the wild. Staff are very knowledgeable and approachable to share their knowledge. The park itself is well designed given the summer climate with many shaded seating areas and cold water fountains as well as a pleasant cafe. The walking tracks are easy on the feet and provide some short-cut options for those who may need them. It is a little too far to walk from the centre of town but options to travel there by car or bus are easy to arrange. Overall probably the number one thing to put on your ‘To Do’ list when visiting for the first time.",4.2

Climbing it misses the point"". Another frequent one was: >""We feel responsibility to visitors to our land and climbing the rock is dangerous. When people are injured or die we feel sad because we failed in our duty to protect our visitors"". My personal view is that liberalism should apply. Do whatever you want as long as it doesn't impact others. If you got to a cathedral in Europe as a tourist you'd be welcome to climb the spire or visit the crypts, even if that's not something someone who worships at the cathedral will do. You'd also be welcome to pray or observe a minute's silence. Sometimes they will close the cathedral for worship. Once finished they'll reopen it to tourists.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"went for a drive one week up to ayers rock (uluru), had a heap of rain so we thought it may not be so much of a desert, what a surprise we were in for, the ""desert"" was in ""paradise"" mode. wild flowers everywhere, trees in blossom, emus and kangaroos all over the joint, little spiny devils were wandering everywhere, camels were very close to the road and birds all over the place......and the colours, my god we were blown away, reds and greens and the sky so blue. then the rock loomed in the distance, it took our breath away it just got bigger and bigger and redder the closer we got, the uluru campground is basic and costly but serviceable, meals in the ""township"" are basic and costly and the ""entrance fee"" is very costly and cheeky high cost of maintaining a rock nowadays apparently, cant climb the thing nowadays, locals dont like it even though they have been doing it for thousands of years, the walk around the base is a stretch but very rewarding. their is a definite ""spirit of place"" here....sacred ground is felt everywhere, dont take any souvenirs or the rock will follow you.",3.4

The Todd mall you are remembering was that same place just a few years ago. That’s how quickly this has changed. Territorians have been screaming for help, asking anyone who will listen: leaders, ministers, radio jocks, interstate media and even the PM who came to town for a quick show. Nobody wants to help. This experience isn’t just Alice Springs either, but territory wide. It’s in Katherine, Greater Darwin, Wadeye, Tenant Creek, and more. The saddest part of your post is the comment about the police. Unfortunately there is nothing that they can do. Move them on? To where. Lock them up? Jails are full. Watch house? That’s full too. There are not enough cops on the beat in Alice Springs or Darwin. There is so much crime on a nightly basis, and not enough cops that it is out of control. Nobody wants to say that though. The police can’t do a thing, they have lost the power. The threats and assaults they are receiving on a nightly basis are unsustainable to anyone’s job. That’s why we have no police. There is no support. They can’t do their jobs. I don’t think they want to do their jobs. Would you? Territorians are scared, no one wants to do anything that might rock the boat or have you branded a racist for trying to make a change. This is not the same Northern Territory anymore. We have lost faith in the Territory Government, and our Chief Minister. Maybe something will change when someone gets killed? Oh wait…..nope.",2.3

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The base walk at Uluru is stunning. Pack lots of water and snacks (and be sure to have a toilet break before you head off - there's no toilets on the base walk!). Be sure to leave early and finish before 11am to avoid the blasting desert heat and give yourself time to do the little offshoot walks to the waterhole and the gorge. The many stories from the traditional custodian's, the Anangu people, dotted along the way emphasise how sacred, ancient and important this place is. I've done this walk in February and late October - both were very hot and it's essential to start early and finish early (it takes between 3 and 4 hours, depending on your speed - but don't expect to walk fast - the heat and the photo opportunities make sure you take it slow). Absolutely worth the heat and the time. If you're not into walking the whole way round, there are smaller more manageable walks as well. In the evening, make sure you visit one of the sunset viewing spots to take in the changing, wondrous colours as the sun goes down. Love this place!",4.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This was my 4th visit to Uluru and it never fails to impress. The first time I visited Uluru was on a motorbike during the winter of 1959. The trip was not one for the faint-hearted. The road was unsealed and prudence was essential as was the ability to mend punctures on the run. Uluru itself was apparently deserted, there were no facilities and we rolled our swags out under the the magnificent canopy of the Milky Way never seeing another soul. Things have changed. The park is highly organised, entrance fees are charged and the traditional owners undestandably ask that visitors refrain from climbing this very sacred site. Climbing will be banned in the near future. I was fortunate enough to be one of the first people to use Peter Severin's wire rope climbing aid. Seeing trees growing out of the soil that had accumulated in some of the fissures on top of the world's largest monolith was an unforgettable experience. I am too old to do any more climbing and I respect the owners' wishes in any case. But seeing Uluru from a distance and walking around its base observing its legends remains an unforgettable experience for me.",4.4

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"If you think the drive in is already troublesome, wait till you have to do the climb up to the top. The pool at the top is however worth the arduous climb up. The initial part is easy with some stairs and gravel but it gets a little tricky when you get nearer the top. You'll need to negotiate rocks and narrow paths which can be quite a challenge for young children or people with some disabilities. To access the pools at the top, you would need to climb down another series of rocks but once you're there all the effort seemed worthwhile. You'll need about 30 minutes if you're averagely fit There are quite a number of small pools separated by rock bars so there is always one that you can make your own. Be forewarned that some can be quite deep and the rocks beneath are slippery and have crevices where one can get your ankle badly twisted if you're not careful. So if you're not a good swimmer, I suggest staying close to the edge. There is another pool at ground level but you'll be missing out completely. A couple we met at the top even told us that they spotted a croc while they were there. The views are astonishing and breathtaking. This is definitely the best of the lot and well worth the drive and climb. There are toilets and showers at the base next to the car park. Kakadu is not without Gunlom.",3.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"OK the not so good part. It costs $25 for a 3 day entry to the national park. Most people don't stay 3 days, so I think there should be a cheaper day rate or per-entry rate. The sun is not guaranteed to set in a way that lights up your vision with golden red glow. Now the good part. There is a road which completely circles Uluru. We drove this perhaps 90 minutes before sunset in the late afternoon. The sky was clear and blue, the sun was getting low, and the rock was a wonderful brick-red / orange sort of colour. This circular road gets very close to the rock in places. There aren't many designated pull-off spots but we almost had the road to ourselves so we stopped a few times. By the time sunset came we were back in the resort on the viewing hill, actually looking more at Kata Tjuta as the sun set almost behind it. The sky by now had quite a lot of cloud cover, and Uluru didn't 'glow' at all. So we were both glad at the time, and then again at sunset, that we had gone when we did (and had this chance to see great sunset silhouettes in the other direction). To stand within yards of a global icon, a symbol of ancient beliefs. That's quite something. As we drove away we saw the pull-offs for the sunset viewing starting to fill. So if your heart is set on this, don't start from the resort too late.",2.9

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Alice Springs Desert Park,">Police commissioner is incompetent Ever heard of Ockham's Razor? It's a logical theorem that suggests that when you're confronted with two (or more) conflicting reports, the one that requires the *least* stretch of the imagination is the one that is most likely to be true. So here we've got a case of it either being: 1. Dutton is inventing anecdotal evidence to make a political point. 2. There is a conspiracy to cover up police inaction, which would require multiple senior politicians and police members to be some combination of grossly incompetent, incredibly negligent or outright malicious in their actions. Taken on balance, the first is far more likely than the second because despite supposedly having knowledge of this sexual abuse, Dutton hasn't actually reported it. And while he might not be a mandatory reporter, the fact that he chose to make vague references in a press conference rather than provide specific details to police speaks volumes -- even before you consider that Dutton is a former police officer and would be familiar with this process. Secondly, there hasn't been a single conscientious objector to come forward and either verify Dutton's claims about the extent of sexual abuse or some kind of conspiracy in the rank-and-file of police. This reeks of Dutton trying to ride the coat-tails of that woman who reported widespread sexual abuse in Alice Springs a few weeks ago. She was presented to the public as a nurse; the strong implication was that she was a registered nurse, but it soon emerged that she was not and that she was far less involved in the process than first suggested. This is exactly what QAnon did with the ""Save the Childen"" movement. They realised very early on that protecting children is an issue that the overwhelming majority of people would support, so they used it as a Trojan horse for their own conspiratorial views.",2.3

Sun rise to sun set, north to south, east to west take the time to admire this unique piece of nature. If you are walking around it I suggest anti clockwise is the way to go as you get so up close and personal with the rock you can't help but be hooked into the spell and the stories. Investigate all the side paths as they all have points of interest to add to your experience.

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I don't think it ""brought the crazies out"", but when you poke shit the flies swam. These remote communities have never been nice, the effects of alcohol and many other social and economic factors have always been around. Alice Springs banning alcohol is far from unprecedented, there are heaps of dry communities out there (they're much nicer too, anecdotally). The problem is that the debate about the voice is about these issues. More Aboriginal people live in SEQ than the NT, but because that's normal suburbia, it doesn't make a good story. Remote Australia is like a different country. Poor education, intermittent (to put it generously) services and no opportunities. It is actually shocking to see coming from a coastal city. Visibly pregnant teenagers, barred windows on every shop, intoxicated people at 9am etc... It's scary. Alien and scary. Xenophobia of what lies within our borders. Now this could go either way for the voice, the shame could make some people vote for or the fear some people against. But either way this is a problem with regional Australia, not Aboriginal people.",1.5
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I'm not a fan of zoos or places that incarcerate animals, but the accommodation at the Desert Park seems reasonable, clean and well kept. We paid extra for an encounter with a wedgetail eagle, which was interesting, although it didn't seem to like my partner much (although she's the bird fan). The photographs taken as part of the experience clearly showed our discomfort in being close (both us and the eagle). The eagle's keeper was knowledgeable and seemed committed to the animals welfare, and because the eagle was unable to fly due to an injury early in life, the Park provides the eagle with a reasonable life. We also toured the other sections of the park: dingo, kangaroos, nocturnal animals, birds and so on. We also went around the nocturnal section with a guide, and saw some animals that weren't around the first time. Again, the guide was knowledgable about the animals. We finished with the bird encounter, which allowed us to see a number of birds in flight, up close. For that reason, it is worth a visit. However, I have a philosophical objection to training animals to perform party tricks. In summary, not a bad place to visit, but if you take the trouble, you can see a number of the animals in the wild, on their terms.",3.7

We meandered through the whole park, enjoying birds and plants, caught a couple of the many guide talks on offer and were once again impressed with the bird show. This is a beautiful park well worth devoting at least 1/2 a day if not more. The space easily disperses visitors and it is not until the bird show or a popular talk that you realise just how many others are also there.

I disagree with the concept of property rights but I am supportive of the cultural and spiritual history of different people. To discount that history because you want to trample all over that particular rock is disrespectful. Land, natural formations and structures have history. If you acknowledge they have history then assuming you have something resembling morals and respect you recognise the importance of preserving that history. The great pyramids can't be climbed because of their historical significance. Uluru is no different. It's inconsequential whether they built it or not because it has been part of their culture for 60 000 years which trumps any ""but they didn't build it argument"". Do you have any objection to the clearing of old growth forests? No one built them yet they still hold important value environmentally and historically. Similarly Uluru holds important historical and spiritual value.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Except the view from the top is *spectacular*, despite what Lonely Planet etc claims. I climbed it back when it was allowed, and I'm not taking a position on whether it's ""wrong"" or not. I did it, and that's that. From the top, climbing at dawn, you see the shadow of the rock pointing like a long, thin dark needle towards the Olgas/Kata Tjuta, which look like opals as the sun rises and begins to catch. It really is a once-in-a-lifetime, spectacular, unique sight. I can't truthfully say that I'm sorry I climbed it. I think it's the kind of view that anyone on this earth has the right to see, if they treat it with respect and don't foul up the rock.",3.5
GoogleMaps,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'm not spiritual or religious, but there is something about this place that I can feel. Have been many times over the years and love it every time. I personally prefer Kara Tjuta at sunset, but you do need to see Uluru sunset for yourself. …",4.3
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The park is very interesting. Olgas rocks, look different from different places and it is very interesting. Watching Ayers Rock at sunset and the next day at sunrise and seeing its changing colors is a great experience. The old frescoes are also very fascinating and of course all the legends about Ayers Rock. When we visited it was hot and the flies were annoying, but nevertheless you can enjoy it very much. In our opinion, it is advisable to get there with a local guide who knows all the places and can explain well.",4.2
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Uluru and Kata Tjuta in April 2019. We stayed 3 nights at the Desert Gardens hotel. The hotel breakfasts were excellent. The hotel people were helpful. There are hop on, hop off buses to Uluru ($49) and Kata Tjuta ($95). Pickups every two hours from 4 stops for Uluru. Kata Tjuta bus leaves twice a day in the morning and evening. If you have a large group it's better to hire a car (book it well in advance). If you want to climb the rock be at the start point (Mala Carpark) at 7am. If it is windy or too hot the climb will be closed. The walk around the the rock is incredible. Go early hour cos it gets very hot later on - it takes 3-4 hours. Take water, hat, sunscreen and some food. We rode a bike around the rock and it was heaps of fun. You could race around the base walk on a bike in 45-60 minutes, but I recommend getting off and checking out the waterholes. We attended the Sounds of Silence dinner which was excellent and the Field of Lights, which was ok. We drove a hire care the 50km out to Kata Tjuta for the sunset and did the Wolpa Gorge walk which was great, the Valley of the Winds walk was closed (too windy). Make sure you get a flynet ($10 or two for $15 at any of the shops at Uluru) as the flys are plentiful. There is an IGA in the Town Square which is well stocked. There's also a Petrol Station which is like a mini supermarket. Petrol is expensive - well over $2/litre. Great holiday in a very sacred place. 3 days is a good number of days to spend out there.",4.2

It also had lots of tables and chairs around it which were convenient, especially if taking advantage of the grill for an evening meal (which we didn't).

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,">Performing mental gymnastics to justify that decision, such as comparing climbing the rock to a building, is highly misleading. However, there are no such mental gymnastics in my argument. My argument is simply about ownership - it's ""their stuff"" and ""they don't want you climbing on it"", whether ""they"" is the Anangu, the Catholics, or your neighbour, and whether ""it"" is Uluru, St Mary's, or a shed. It doesn't matter *why* ""they"" don't want you climbing it. &#x200B; >whereas people climb hills and mountains all the time On public property. People don't go climbing hills and mountains on farms without the permission of the owners. People also go camping all the time, but that doesn't mean that you have the moral right to pitch a tent in a stranger's suburban backyard. Is 'not camping in a backyard' a political right? Of course. Private property itself is political. There is nothing in the physical world that reflects that person X owns area of land Y. The concept of 'ownership' itself is political. It's all down to what a government (a political construct) stores in it's records (another political construct) about ownership (a third political construct).",2.1

Reddit/interestingasfuck,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"That may be true, but it doesn't mean there's no littering in Australia. Uluru is also very dangerous to climb, so retrieving liter is completely impractical. No, but a church is repairable, a rock is not. You wouldn't hand every tourist the Shroud of Turin, the most sacred Christian artefact. Similarly Uluru is perhaps the most important symbol of Indigenous culture in Australia. People are free to look at it and interact with parts of it, in the same way they are for symbols of other religions. Uluru is functional for Indigenous ceremonies (in its caves and fissures), and not all of the Hagia Sophia and other monuments are available for public access (for a variety of reasons including degradation)",2.7
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Obviously if you're the area- you've come to see Uluru. The first glimpse is amazing, and the closer you get the more amazing it is. We decided to do the base walk- but my advice is- if you have limited time - just do the main walks near Mala carpark. I didn't really enjoy the whole base walk. First- it was very hot. Unfortunately there are not many rest stops along the way- which is odd given the harsh weather.... a few extra seats/rest areas would make all the difference. One whole side of the rock is basically a ""sacred site"" so the walking track is detoured a whole way out and no photographs are allowed- you're so far from the rock you can get the same view driving past. If you do intend to do the whole base walk- go early in the summer months, by 11am it is unbearable. Take plenty of water & sunscreen. No need for hiking boots- sneakers are fine on the gravel track. The climb is much steeper than i imagined (we didn't do it) - it closes at 8am in summer and i believe as of 2019 it will be banned forever.",2.4
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We landed into Uluru and did the 2 day tour. First day - group meet and drive over to Uluru to do the base walk, it’s hot and sandy with flies everywhere. Don’t let this out you off. Fly nets for your face/head can be purchased in the gift shop. That evening you drive to a spot to see sundown and have dinner (veggie or meat option) and watch the sun setting onto Uluru. You then go to camp, there’s a toilet and shower block plus safe storage for your cases. We had a sleeping bag and over bed thing but it was so warm I slept out with it open and didn’t get bitten ( I normally attract them in their droves) We went for a walk before bed to see the stars - wow!! I’ve never seen the Milky Way before and above my head was a clear sky full of stars twinkling. 💜 Second day is an early start as you watch the sunrise coming up behind Uluru. Once the sun has risen you head off to Kata Tjuta for a climb before heading back to the airport. The tour is very spiritual, you break away from normal life and it’s a worthwhile trip to listen about how sacred Uluru is to the aboriginals. Loved every moment and everyone should visit.",4.5

The very first time we tried to get there the road was so corrugated we only got about 2 km down the dirt road as it was so bad even in a 4x4. We tried again a year later road was much better, although there were sections of the road that were very rough, although people were driving with cars.

Our systems have failed people and there are angry hurting kids who are crying out for help by doing stupid shit and committing crimes and then, once they are caught they are still not given the help they need. Please do not misinterpret what I am saying as me denying there is a problem. There 100% is. But the people of this town are not pulling together to try and solve it. And this problem can not be solved by one organisation and it can not be solved overnight. It will have to be a joint effort and it will take a life time.

The people are friendly, the culture is rich and there is such a strong spirit among those of us who call it home. You can always count on the community coming together to support you if you find yourself in a rough patch. I also want to say that there are SO MANY wonderful local aboriginal people who are also worried and mourning and feel a great sense of shame. Do not let what you see paint your opinion of them as a whole group. There is a minority who are ruining it for everyone else. There are those online who will talk about how many of us are leaving this town.... there are also a huge group of us who refuse to leave as we care deeply and want stay and work to help this lovely place. I don't think I can fully explain the love I have for Alice but when I first stepped foot in the NT as a kid I knew I would live in the NT once I grew up and when I moved to Alice 7 years ago I immediately knew I had found my home.

I crossed off a list of birds and plants that I had never seen before. The red soils of the park covers in wildflowers was spectacular. The frèe flying bird shows are informative. Loved all the avery areas, the nocturnal house is one of the best I've ever seen, and the bush medicine talk was well presented from a very knowledgeable lady who has worked at the park for many years, well worth going to. We had fresh sandwiches, at the onsite cafe. These sort of places are often expensive for food and drinks, the prices here are reasonable with good selection, friendly service. In fact everyone of the staff we met were friendly and looked as they loved their work environment. This is not an animal park, yes there are animals, but primarily it is a desert park featuring the different features of a desert, such as billabongs and regions. Also has a well appointed gift shop.

I was so glad I did after i experienced the gorge. This was an organised tour run by the ghan for a two hour cruise along Katherine Gorge. We experienced two gorges and after the first gorge we had to get off the boat, walk across the other side to board another boat. This allowed us to see more and learn about the local history. Our guide was great! He explained about bush tucker and how to use the plants near the gorge for bush medicine. We also came across two small crocodiles and saw the change in colour of the sandstone's due to the sun positions. Make sure you bring a hat, sunglasses and especially sunscreen! The sun will roast you!! Once you get off the coach you will come across many (and i mean PLENTY) of fruit bats hanging off most trees in the national park and they also give you cold drinks and fruit salad prior to the cruise.

In 2008, I was living in Darwin, and I was the head of the lighting department for a staging company there. We trucked 4 shipping containers to Alice Springs for the Brolgas (the NT Tourism awards). When we started unloading the containers at 8am, it was already 35 degrees, and the containers were sitting about 150 metres away from the loading door of the venue, which was uphill on black bitumen. It hit 45 degrees at about 10am, and the 8 of us went through 40 litres of iced powerade mix in three hours. Good thing we had a forklift to get everything up the hill and into the venue. So we started setting up, and at about 3pm I went outside to have a smoke. It was still 45 degrees, but in the ten minutes it took me to have my cigarette, the temperature dropped to 12 degrees, and a massive storm hit. It was wild. Dark as night, lightning, absolutely pissed down with rain. The Todd River flash flooded. 3 people died, because they were sleeping off their lunch booze in the shady river bed. They say that if you see the Todd River flowing three times, you're considered to be a local.

But you do have to sit quietly for a while to appreciate this. An added benefit is that the many bird hides give respite to the hot sun - we did it on a hot 36C day but we managed to while away 4 hours there.

The tourism for the theme parks in Gold Coast are entirely private hands but that doesn’t mean Queensland and the city don’t advertise the shit out of it. And Uluru isn’t even a private tourist attraction as the land is leased to the Australian Government for tourist reasons and they operate in partnership with the national parks services. The indigenous owners are only entitled to 25% of tourism earnings and most of that is spent on the local community and indigenous property ownership doesn’t operate the same way as private custodianship.

Early morning if possible - it can be super spiritual being there alone. 3. Kubara pools walk, on a separate fork down the road to Nourlangie, is a nice walk. 4. If the Nourlangie Barrk walk is open in August, I would count it as a MUST do. Even the first little bit where you ascend to the top of the outlier, which takes about 30 minutes. 5. Ubirr can be super hot during the middle of the day, would highly recommend morning or afternoon to beat the crowds (it's one of the busiest attractions). Honestly when there's a lot of other people at these places in Kakadu it completely fucking ruins it. It is COMPLETELY different for example when I was there during COVID and I'd rock up to a place nine times out of ten and there was no one else there. 6. Scenic flight over Jim Jim/Twin in a helicopter is pretty speccy (from Jabiru) 7.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Great place to start your NT trip, to see wildlife and plants of Central Australia and get a feeling of the outback. We came there early in the morning to spend a recommended 3-4 hours and finished spending the whole day. Very pleasant and relaxing experience. Park is set in a beautiful location with orange-red MacDonnell Ranges on the background and lots of bushes in bloom in mid August, providing a startling contrast with red soil and cloudless blue sky. Morning 10am birdshow was really nice, with local originality and somewhat different from Melbourne-Sydney zoos similar shows. Nocturnal house in Desert Park is outstanding. Probably the best I have seen in Australia. All animals and birds we very active and we spend hours in a cool dark building returning a few times and checking on different enclosures. I also highly recommend to see the movie. It is about 15-20min long and is very good. Its “grand finale” was utterly spectacular and unlike anything I have seen or expected. Imagine the last scene of the movie as a striking panoramic view of MacDonnell Ranges, then music ends and the whole wall-sized screen starts slowly sliding down revealing identical picture of real MacDonnell Ranges in front of you! If you come to the cinema in the late afternoon (we were about 4pm), an evening light intensifies the red colours of the rocks and blues of the sky, making it a really breathtaking and unforgettable movie ending. When you walk through the park you can't help noticing how much labour and love was put into its creation. From park layout and all enclosures to children playground and information boards – all is very carefully planned and wonderfully made. All graphics are so funny and cute, I kept taking photos of them. All amenities are very clean, well stocked and conveniently located. Staff at the cafeteria is very pleasant and friendly. All in all I highly recommend to visit the Park to everyone. There is no way anyone could see so many animals and birds in a wild even if you spend months travelling the country. We were camping for over a week (between Alice Springs and Yulara) after visiting the Park and haven't seen much of the wildlife – apart from numerous brumbies, a few rock wallabies and lone dingo pup, not even as a roadkill (thankfully). So, if we did not visited Desert Park, we would leave Red Centre with the firm believe that no one lives there :) My advice – take your time, do not rush and your will see a lot. I understand most tourists are on a tight schedule, but if covering large distances “for a record” - “I've been there” is not a main objective of your holiday, follow “less is more” approach and you will enjoy your journey much more.",4.7

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"From someone who lives in alice springs First off the new idiot mayor was asking for the army because he has no idea how local government works. Just attend a town meeting. Second the so called extra police for alice springs this year, they spent most of the time in operations in remote communities and very little in town. They also left before the busy season of Christmas when from the 20th dec to mid of January when they go on a house break in rampage every year. Last year it was almost every day of Jan till mid Feb some youth try to break into my place. But I can say last year response by police was time decent, unlike this year's non existence. If you had driven past the police at night in last 6 months you would have seen that they only had two car out on patrol. So response time is 1 1/2 hours unless emergency then at least 1/2 hour most of the time. The council does currently pay ""talice security"" to patrol the town at night and watch the cameras, but if seen any of their security officer they are on their phone all night and just stand their and not call in the stolen cars doing burnouts in from of them. if you ask about it they grunt a yes then go back to watching tiktoc. As to alcohol restrictions, they won't have much effect unless they close the sly goggers in the town camps and it mostly youth stealing alcohol not adults. The youth problem has been getting worst every year since they reduced the funding to a third and redirected the remaining services to limit scope of works. ( they did increase it by 30% after 12 months of major youth issues) Yes this is also same time they removed the banned drinkers register and we had people partying in the streets for months till they doubled the police in town for a few months. Youth issue is partly due to culture difference and centerlink payments. Traditionally the aunty and grandmother look after the kids but if the parents want the extra money, they keep the kids on paper. Then dump them on the grandmothers and when their no longer a child under tradition at 13, they do what ever they desire. Where are the parents about half are off living their life on the extra centerlink money. As for youth corrections that the only place they get a education for most of these youth out on the streets at night. Because the parents see it as school / goverment to educate them not parent's responsibility to send them to school. Anyway, for me, I have had enough and I am leaving town.",2.5

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"When doing the full lap, here's a big tip for you - hire a bike for the little ones. Cuts down on the whinge-factor and takes the complaints further away from you! We hired bikes for our 8 and 13 year old and it made the experience much better. Given that it took us about 3 hours to do the full loop of about 12km with detours (taking it at moderate pace with rests, reading stops and snapping many photos). Also, make sure you do the walk early in the morning to avoid the heat and another tip would be to use the shade of Uluru whilst its there. This means if doing it from the Mala carpark side, do it clockwise. If wanting to do a shorter version of the walk where you get to see all the good bits, do the Mala Walk and you'll get the highlights tour. Amazing rock features and a waterhole in the desert! The Kuniya walk is also a quickie tour if you are running out of time and want to see some rock art and a waterhole. If you want to climb it - don't hold your breath. Actually you probably should, because the extra wind you create will likely shut it down because the wind meters are very sensitive there! Make sure you read the opening hours if you are not there in peak season, and if inclined to go to the top, check at the entrance what time the ranger makes the call on wind - it might save you some sleep. Oooh yeah - another thing - we were there for 4 days so if you ask nicely they will extend your 3 day pass for free on the 3rd day. Make sure you do the sunset car park - this was spectacular to the point of almost looking fake! Its not like you are going to come here and not do Uluru, but this might be useful if you are short of time (or energetic kids!). Enjoy.",4.2
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Don't go here expecting to see lots and lots of animals - though you will see quite a few.

Wandering through is a lovely and relaxing way of experiencing the environment - the guided talks and bird show are also excellent.,3.9

The bird show was certainly a highlight, held in the park at the base of the McDonnell Ranges, it's a spectacular location and an entertaining show! All of the staff we encountered were incredibly helpful and friendly. One staff member (I wish i remembered his name!) even came to find us at around 4:15pm as he knew our bus was leaving at 4:30pm and didn't want us to miss it!

Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"> Alice Springs Town Campers are proud of who they are and the struggle they are involved in to be recognised as an important part of the Alice Springs community. They recognise that not everyone understands their struggle or their pride in who they are, including other Aboriginal people in Alice Springs. They say people are always looking at what is wrong with Town Camps and fail to see the strength and bonds that have been forged through years of struggle. They say they struggled for years to create their living spaces, through gaining leases and forming Housing Associations under the Tangentyere umbrella, and to maintain their control over how these Town Camps were run. They tell us that a report just prior to the Intervention assessed them against 10 standards that had been established as benchmarks of housing performance. They say they scored above the National average on 7 of these and were at the average on one and only failed to meet these benchmarks on two. They say they can’t understand the logic of, in their words, “collapsing a successful housing management program” and replacing it with a system that has not produced anywhere near the same outcomes over the past 10 years. >In their view, all the current difficulties are a direct result of the Federal Government decision to remove their control over the leases as part of the Emergency Response (the Intervention). They say this meant that their previous slow, but gradual growth in managing their living spaces, was removed for a political decision that has not benefited them in any way. Prior to the forced relinquishment of their leases to the Commonwealth, they say they managed difficult residents, using trespass notices. The process was that the relevant housing association would come together, usually with the tenant, and see if it was possible for them to change their behaviour. If the tenant was willing to make changes, no eviction. If the tenant was unable to change they made a collective decision, and the offending tenant was issued with a trespass notice. The Town Campers say it worked well. https://tfhc.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/452564/Town-Camps-report_F_Section_Town-camps_Part-D.pdf",3.6

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is and should be it's first name of course but I think it is worth preserving a place for European names because they are like it or not part of our history. Ayers rock is a name that is still correct and connected to history and the story of European invasion and settlement, many place names are connected to the expeditions and wanderings of early European settlers. Australia has countless indigenous and foreign names for places. Eg. Garriwerd/Grampians Kunanyi/My Wellington. And of course the problem with European naming was that it ignored overrode and erased in some cases Indigenous naming and significance. Rightly efforts to rename and reintroduce original indigenous names should continue. But We shouldn't try to override the European names in the same way as it is more important to preserve the story of their names. Keeping both names valid means people will always ask why it has two names and hopefully understand more of our country's troubled but historically rich past.

The base walk of the rock really makes you realise how huge it is. We saw plenty of wildlife along the way, including reptiles such as the Western Brown and lots of gorgeous little dragons. Sunrise and sunset can not be missed. We were fortunate enough to catch the full moon rising right beside the rock which was so special. If you’re into photography this National Park is a dream. You will love it. Don’t forget the Olga’s they are fascinating and you can’t see Uluru without a hike and sunset there!",4.9

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Confession. This is not a ‘friend’s ’ footage. This is my footage. I climbed Uluru on Sunday. I wanted to spark discussion and hear other’s P.O.V without the personal attacks clouding how I might receive it. I’ve climbed to Machu Picchu, Everest Base Camp, St Paul’s Cathedral, the Vatican Dome, The Great Wall of China, The Great Pyramid of Giza (well... as high as I was allowed to go), The Grand Canyon, Santorini and The Burj Khalifa...I could go on... But for me, as an Australian, I can honestly say climbing Uluru topped them all. Seeing the harsh, red desert as far as the eye can see... the serenity, the remoteness.... the very centre of my country and culture to which I was born.... Most pertinent however was comprehending/reflecting on my insignificance; my short, fragile, mortal life contrasted with the (seemingly) immortal, immutable strength of Uluru.... It was almost a spiritual experience for me (climbing Uluru)... though I recognise irony/hypocrisy in what I’m about to say, this experience grew my respect and understanding for our indigenous forefathers, who, for 60,000+ years have been stewards of our great land. Caring for it, a part of it... understanding their place in nature, their fragility, their responsibility. As a (third generation) Australian, I too am a part of that responsibility (stewardship)... irrespective of the colour my skin (like that should count for anything!) or even historic ancestry! I knew just simply waking around it, or taking a helicopter flight would not evoke the same introspection. I needed to climb it. So, as soon as I heard it was closing, like many others, I booked my flight. I know many will not agree with my subjective, nuanced reasoning to climb... I have (and will be) judged as ‘a selfish shitcunt’, ‘a deplorable dick head’ or an ‘arrogant asshole’. ... But i think the controversy of the Uluru climb is actually an (inappropriate) proxy/scapegoat for the bigger issue in Australia: respecting indigenous culture and making amends for historic injustice and cultural genocide committed at the hands of colonisers... I don’t think banning the climb is the solution here. I will respect the wishes of the Anangu and never climb again, but I’m glad I took the opportunity while it was still legal and allowed. I hope one day the Anangu will decide to guide (the Uluru climb) those who are wanting to learn from Aboriginal culture, so that one day my children can experience the significance of Uluru. Furthermore, I hope that one day all Australians will reach a point of reconciliation and integration with indigenous culture that the colour of our skin or the tally of our Australian ancestors does not determine our ownership/responsibility for our land... but that we are collectively responsible and equally accountable for our Great South Land. No TLDR - if you want to understand my (subjective) perspective... you need all of it ;)",2.7
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We weren’t sure what to expect however Uluru appears more a mountain range than a single rock. It’s awe inspiring and you can touch it.

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Let's set the record straight: no one is being dishonest about the document. There's been a lot of confusion and perhaps even gaslighting over its length, with claims that it's just a one-pager and claims that it is multiple. In truth, while the Uluru Statement itself may be one page, there are several supplementary pages associated with it. Megan Davis, the author, has consistently highlighted the consultative nature of the process and acknowledged these multiple pages on various occasions. However, she has also emphasized that the Uluru Statement is singularly one page, especially when addressing concerns about the supporting documents that were a part of the consultation. So, according to Ms. Davis, it is both one and many depending on the situation or concerns. It's misleading and unfair to accuse the no campaign of deceit in this context.",2.2

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We had a whirlwind tour in Japan, New Zealand and Oz and we saw some amazing places and did some great things, however for me, the bets place by far was Uluru.

Watching the sun go down here was one of the best moments of my life, it was that good. I would do it on a daily basis and not get bored of it. The helicopter tour of Uluru and Kata Tjuta was out of this world, having experienced both at ground level, to see them from the air was jaw dropping. I usually try and note some 'area for improvement' on my reviews to give a balanced view however I don't have any for this place. The only thing I would say is that in about 60 years time when the lease runs out, I hope the local people take it back from the government and either run it for themselves, their own benefit, or better still close it down as an attraction and let the people/land/nature have it back for good.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This zoo covers a pretty large area so they can give the animals lots of space. Birds are held in aviaries so the birds can fly. Some of them were walk-in aviary where the birds did have much space and the tourist can view them without netting or glass. We could also walk between the kangaroos. We did visit on a hot afternoon so several animals did hide in the shade or were not very active. So in some sections it did look like nobody was home. Several wild birds did choose to be here. I did like in particular the Nocturnal House; better than the Reptile Centre. We spend over 2.5 hours here but if it was not that hot we would have stayed longer. If you want to join the activities you need much more time. We did only see the bird show. This was by far the best zoo we did visit in Australia. Recommended!

Walking the circular trail counter clockwise, you climb about 100' up, following a train that is well established, most of the up hill sections are concrete steps making the walking easy. It took about 15 minutes to leisurely make it to the top where there is a large overlook deck. The views of the gorge and surroundings is well worth the 15 minutes to hike. We continued on with the trail, descending in the gorge, stopping many times to watch geckos and lizards on the trail. Making it down to the river bed, the rocks change into this wonder purple hue. It is interesting to see Gum trees growing on a rock ledge with no apparent source of water. The entire trek around took 1.5 hours, but a good portion of that was watching the birds, animals, and scenery.",3.9

You can do EVERYTHING by yourself. The hop on hop off bus is EXPENSIVE, better off renting 2 cars. Get the fly nets. Hike around Uluru base, it's about 7 miles. Hike at Kata Tjuta, it's magical. If you have a clear night, just drive out 10 minutes and you will have amazing skies, download the stars app on your phone. Grab cheap food at the IGA grocery store. Avoid the Kiosk restaurant.

You can’t get to Uluru unless part of a tour (none available on this either), use the hop on hop off, have car/transport. Limited hire cars, most already gone but did manage to get a hertz at the resort - available in 2 days time - also high demand.

Reddit/pics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I did a base walk around it about 6 months ago. Our tour guide has been doing trips around Uluru for about 15 years and gave us all a talk about the choice to climb it, or not, the night before we headed there. First on the list of reasons not to climb it, is that it's a sacred place to the Aboriginal people who own it and have been living there for over 20 thousand years. 20 thousand years. People climb up it and find they need to piss, because it's a long ass climb, and they have no choice but to piss on the most sacred part of the place, which then gets into the waterfalls etc around it. Secondly, any time someone gets hurt or dies doing it, the Aboriginal landowners enter a period of mourning, as they feel responsible for the safety of everyone who visits. It can last weeks or more and usually involves them hitting themselves on the head with a rock until they bleed as part of the tradition. So if that's not reason enough, there's also the fact that a bunch of people have died doing it or been otherwise injured. That and really, the climb isn't what it's about - the view from the top is pretty much just empty desert. The really interesting stuff is on the ground at the different important sites around it, the waterfalls, paintings, etc. Thankfully they're closing the climb this year I believe, and I'm glad they are.",3.6

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It's ironic, isn't it? This entire process around the Uluru Statement is pitched as a journey of ""healing"" and ""truth-telling"". Yet, when someone seeks clarity or raises questions, they're sidelined, treated as misinformed, or even accused of spreading disinformation. Moreover, it seems the 'Yes' campaign strategically avoids certain topics, likely because they're unpopular, and not due to any perceived ""poisoning of the well."" Why are some truths or perspectives seemingly more valid than others? If we're genuinely committed to reconciliation and understanding, then let's have a full, open conversation. Otherwise, let's stop pretending this is about truth at all. Personally, I think 'The Voice' is a bad idea because it is vague, a special privilege that no other person living in Australia will ever receive (no matter their circumstance) and would be too hard to remove if it turns into a shamble and frankly I think it will turn into a bureaucratic waste of money that won't do anything to achieve its aims and just become another ATSIC, only this time constitutionally enshrined. I don't care about how many pages a document is. I care about 'The Voice' and the values and goals that went into its creation and there's a whole lot of context there that Yes-campaigners don't want to touch with a ten-foot pole for a reason. I don't need to poison any wells or muddy any waters. The yes-campaigners are doing a good job of that themselves.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After spending $1.92 per litre for petrol, and $2.10 for Auto Gas we arrived at the gates to the Uluru National Park. There were no signs showing the entry fee until we reached the the ticket office. For 3 people for three days it was $114.00, $38.00 each. There were no day passes available, three days was the minimum. When we asked the ticket seller about a one day pass she replied ""everyone asks for that"". In addition there were no Senior or Pensioner discounts available. We chose not to enter and turned around in the well used reversing loop. We immediately made the decision to return home, ignore our Prime Ministers pleas to spend our holiday dollars in Australia , save our money and as soon as we can, head overseas and give them our hard earned money.

For me, as a fifth generation Australian, Uluru is significant to me. Climbing it, viewing the vast landscape around it enabled me to reflect on the indigenous culture of my homeland... how they cared for and lived in the area for 10,000s of years.... I grew a greater appreciation and respect for our indigenous culture and felt connected to this land in a way I’ve never been able to before. Only climbing Uluru did this for me.

It's iconic & world famous & you think you know it until you actually get there & see it with your own eyes! We were lucky enough to be on a tour that did both a sunset viewing & a sunrise viewing as well as a walk around part of the base in the daytime, so we got to see lots of different aspects of 'the rock' at different times of the day. Yes, when all is said & done, it is just 'a big ole rock in the middle of nowhere', but wow, what a sight it is. There was something purely magical about sipping prosecco while waiting for the sun to set. Up at 4am to see the sun rise with a cup of hot tea but we didn't expect it to be quite so chilly (wrap up warm if you're doing a sunrise tour!!) It was very crowded on both occasions as you'd expect, with plenty of indigenous peoples selling paintings.

The guides spread food along the path just prior to the tour, so it ensures there are plenty of animals about and close to the path. Do not book too far in advance. I booked about a month prior to going, and my booking had everything wrong. First off, there is no reservation reference number or confirmation email given. When I showed up, the person at the desk told me they didn't take reservations. Someone from the office came out so I could explain, and then I learned that the reservation person was at the bank. Fortunately, they let us in, resolving to figure out what had happened. I got a call when the person returned from the bank saying everything was fine, we just needed to show up that evening for the night tour. Once again, my name was not on the list.

However, let me also state that the road was just graded a few days before I went and I would recommend checking on the status/condition before going. Hike up is not bad and waterfall pools are amazing. I wish that I had camped out at Gunlom, but had to get back to Jabiru so just missed sunset. Make time to see this place!",4.1

We visited both Kata Tjuta and Uluru just because these are the only one you should really visit. both changes color during sunrise and sunset and spectacular to see. There are dedicated locations for sunrise and sunset viewing so thing a car is a must unless you have a tour. In Kata Tjuta we did the Walpa George walk which is a good 30 minutes and was the only available walk during that time. In Uluru we did the based walk for 10 kilometres and you are required to bring water to avoid dehydration! I also climbed Uluru which Im not proud (just saying) because I found the notice not to climb it very confusing because people are climbing too and there are built in chaina for it.,4.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Humble brag - From watching stars adjacent to the rock the first night, to seeing Sunrise the second morning, sunset that night and then sunrise from the Olgas viewing platform, you can not get enough of Uluru. Disgusted to see that people are still allowed to climb up, but delighted that not many people do. In fact, where the occasional person does climb up the prescribed path, there's a small nook at ground level, where I felt inclined to kneel as though feeling the heart of the heart of Australia - A very special moment, and one I wish more people would consider instead of wanting to clamber all over it! Actually, did the Skydive over the rock during the afternoon and couldn't recommend it highly enough - Expensive, but what a way to see Nature's finest cathedral. Great value for money, getting a 3 day pass. Great guides and wardens who kicked me out, on two separate occasions for being inside the park at night - But did so with such good humour, one had to smile! Highly recommend the Olga's platform for one dawn viewing if you can - Uluru sits due East of them, so the sunrise behind Uluru is astonishing",3.8
Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Alice Springs Desert Park,"So just to sum up Dutton's latest political moment: * Returns randomly to Alice Springs (with Jacinta Price, after calls to replace Leeser with her), and starts demanding the AFP take control of the town and claims from talking to locals (some of whom apparently are business owners that received money from the LNP Govt, and one of them apparently goes on Sky News???) that there is rampant child sexual abuse. * At this point a journo says local groups reject this and asks for evidence of the claims * Dutton mocks them for being an out of towner * Guy actually lives there * Dutton also says that asking for evidence is too ""ABC"", basically copying Trump and using ""FAKE NEWS"" against anyone he doesn't like * Various NT govt people and groups also critisise Dutton, and point out that under law if he is aware of child sexual abuse he is obligated to make a report to the police. * Meanwhile others in the shadow cabinet are saying they will not vote/campaign No, and far-right figures (Hanson and Alex Antic) are demanding said shadow cabinet members be pushed out. Now, there almost certainly is a crime issue in Alice Springs, and almost certainly more most be done at all levels... But running up and demanding the whole place be put under martial law, and randomly critisising anyone who doesn't agree with you isn't exactly screaming ""I AM HERE TO START THE HEALING PROCESS"", either. Edit/update: Sussan Ley has provided data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (ah, now it is okay to ""trust the bureaucrats"" on this issue, after Dutton critisised a reporter for asking for evidence) showing that child sexual abuse is indeed much higher in Alice Springs than the national average. Here is the thing - the numbers she is quoting from ARE FROM 2021. At this point, the Alcohol restrictions were still in place, general crime stats had been rising since 2020, and more critically, PETER DUTTON AND SUSSAN LEY WERE LITERALLY RUNNING THE COUNTRY AT THE TIME. Again, there are serious issues at play here, but we have people rocking up and yelling about issues *they couldn't solve and almost ignored*, and expecting this not to be viewed cynically...",2.8

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We had a great experience in Nitmiluk National Park during our visit in December (wet season). Enjoyed the 2 night stay inside the park at Nitmiluk Chalets - the best decision - with lots of greens and wildlife around (birds, wallabies). Loved the tasty, reasonable priced food in Sugarbag Cafe at the Visitor Center and pre-cooked meals delivered to the room. On top of all, we had the rare opportunity to cruise Katherine Gorge on a power boat with only a few other people. The river was flooded due to heavy rains and the cruise was initially cancelled but then they decided to take us on a power boat. It felt almost like a roller coaster on the raging river, a bit scary but definitely an adventure. We went as far as the third gorge and straight. Normally boats cruise the calm water down to the 2nd gorge with a short stone walk in between where water level is shallow. Highly recommend this awesome national park.",4.6
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Desert Park is well designed with good walking paths and excellent signage set against the backdrop of the MacDonnell Ranges. You can wander at will but the best experience is to attend the many presentations held throughout the day. The park opens early and staff will help you plan your visit to enable attendance at various talks as well as time to visit the enclosures and aviaries. The most popular is the Free Flying Bird Show which is presented twice a day in the Nature Theatre The Park is divided into zones featuring Desert Rivers, Sand Country and Woodland showing the flora and fauna of each area. It can be chilly early in the day in winter so a warm jacket is necessary and a hat and sunscreen is always needed. There is a small play area for children which was popular and a cafe which was closed on the day of our visit. The park is clearly signposted and there is plenty of parking.",4.2
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A great presentation of desert regions in the central Australian area. Displays, movies and explanations describe desert life in a very interesting and entertaining way. The raptor show was excellent demonstrating several birds of prey (which will fly right past your head,) The presenter of “living in the desert” Jeromy, gave a fascinating and informative talk on aboriginal history and life skills, necessary for survival in the “outback”. Well worth the time (we spent 5 hours there).",4.5

Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"First of all, thanks for not just immediately jumping on the 'I hope this bloke gets shivved in Alice Springs' dogpile. Crime sucks. There are no winners. It is one of the worst things about the human race. There is no 'nice way' of dealing with it IMO. Restorative justice does often result in better victim satisfaction per one of the sources I posted above, but you can't un-stab somebody, and you can't un-burn down someone's house. It's about a least-worst approach. There are always going to be people who are irredeemable, who commit acts of cruelty with no remorse, and yeah, lock them up for life AFAIC so we can study them and identify them at birth. I like to think that most crimes are committed by good people who have had hard lives or made bad choices and that the overwhelming majority of criminals can be saved. The hard pill to swallow is that maybe a victim's personal sense of revenge or justice isn't really that relevant. That is not something I say lightly. I don't think most of us, deep down, really want to inflict suffering on another human being, even one who has wronged us. I think most victims of crime feel the way I felt. Just really sad, and frustrated, and really wanting to make sure it didn't happen again. I don't think I ever really thought 'I hope they torture the bastard' or anything like that. Crime is complicated.",1.2

I'm sure it's fine in a big 4WD, but it was a bit of a challenge in the small 2WD I had. To get to the pools at the top, it is a bit of a climb on a rocky track. If you are of average fitness, it should be no problem, though. There is also a plunge pool down the bottom of the falls, but it really is worth the hike to get to the top.

But the long intervention years of federal cutbacks to communities, the mainstreaming of programming, punitive cashless welfare and years of opaque funding processes forcing them to go cap-in-hand to the minister for a bite of the Coalition’s $4.9bn Indigenous advancement strategy while millions were handed to big business, have also been to blame. Aboriginal organisations say they warned the Morrison government that if the intervention-era bans on alcohol in remote communities were to lapse, harms would rise dramatically. They weren’t heard, but they were right. In mid-July, liquor became legal in some communities for the first time in 15 years. NT police statistics show property offences have jumped by almost 60% over the past 12 months, assaults have increased by 38% and domestic violence assaults by 48%. “This was something that was predicted,” Dr John Boffa told Guardian Australia. Boffa is chief medical officer at Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, the main health organisation in the region. “A range of Aboriginal organisations wrote to governments warning them that if this legislation was simply allowed to lapse, that we would see the sort of crisis we’re seeing now and, unfortunately, it’s happened,” Boffa said. If only there was a formal way of requiring governments to listen to these expert voices and to the communities they serve, whose experience, knowledge and hard work are essential to making any real progress.

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"This was my favourite place in the MacDonnell Ranges and one of my favourites across the whole of our trip. The Gorge was an easy and fairly short walk from the carpark. The cliffs rose up steeply and redly above a cool, peaceful looking waterhole. There was a large sandy beach along one side of the water, with fascinating gum trees scattered around. We swam in the waterhole which was cold and refreshing, but not so cold that we couldn't stay in for a good while. There was plenty of sun on the water for most of the afternoon. Opposite the beach the water went right up to the cliff face so it was possible to swim over and look straight up at the rocks. It was incredibly beautiful and incredibly peaceful. We saw water birds and the younger kids enjoyed exploring the rocks around the edge of the water rather than going for a swim. The rocks were patterned and interesting shapes. After our swim we walked up to the lookout above the waterhole. The views across the MacDonnell ranges were interesting as we gained height. There were again interesting rocks and plants to look at as we walked. There were a lot of stairs, but it wasn't a long walk to the lookout. From here we could see along the gorge and really see the layers of rocks that made up the cliff walls. The waterhole looked amazing from this view as well. There were a couple of ghost gums up near the lookout that added something really special to the view. There is a longer walk through the gorge that we didn't do. The water level was high when we were there and at times the walk would have involved wading through water - this varies depending on how much rain there has been. That walk is a lot harder than simply going up to the lookout, but it sounded fantastic. There is a kiosk near the carpark which serves food during the day and there is lots of information available about the area. There is a camping ground there - if we'd realised how great the gorge was we would have camped here and spent much more time exploring the gorge. The kiosk sometimes serves pizza at night for those in the campground. We found it hard to leave this place, it was magical and one of our absolute highlights.",4.7

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I lived in Alice Springs for 7 months. Its no different to any of the other cities in Australia except its surrounded by desert not ocean. It is pretty safe. The aboriginals can be very aggressive to white people but if you ignore them they leave you alone. They dont do anything to us but are often seeing fighting with each other. They also smell really bad so have to hold your breath when they are nearby. The Casino is the place where most people go for dinner, drinks, anything at night. There wasnt much crime when i was there because there was no druggies.",3.6
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Right, so when ""Australians"" vote on what to do with the site, who wins that vote every single time - the majority white people with no historical connection to the site, or the people who've been living there for thousands of years? The difference between Uluru and Stonehenge is that the people who find Uluru sacred have a continuing and unbroken tradition of living on that land. No one even knows for sure who built Stonehenge or why, so it'd be impossible to even identify the descendants of the traditional owners. The Anangu people have been living around Uluru for thousands of years before our ancestors even got here. Yeah you can find some modern hippies who think they're wizards or whatever - they don't have the history of connection to that site that the Anangu people do to Uluru.",2.4

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Firstly, we visited in October and it was very hot, around 36/37 degrees. If that is the time of year you plan to visit, go as early as possible to avoid the worst of it. It's open from 8:30am. We started our visit by going into the little cinema to watch a video presentation about how the desert was formed. It was interesting but if you have small children, it might not hold their interest for too long. If you're not really interested in that type of thing and just want to see what's there now, you can just skip it. The animal exhibits are set out along pathways that wind through desert vegetation (similar to the Territory Wildlife Park, in Darwin). There are aviaries that allow you to get close to and good views of many of the smaller bird species of the area. The free flight bird show was good but in all honesty, it's very similar to the ones at Taronga Zoo or Healesville Sanctuary, just with a different backdrop. The night house was my favourite (and not just for the air conditioning) It was good to get to see many of the creatures that hide during the day. Included some endangered species, such as the mala, which I was very excited to see and there were plenty of reptiles on display as well. We only managed a couple of hours before the heat became too much but we were glad we visited. Most of it is outside, so hats, sunscreen and water are a MUST!! They also offer after dark tours that allow you to see some of the animals at night but unfortunately, we were there over a weekend, when that tour doesn't run. It's only a few minutes out of Alice Springs, definitely worth a visit, especially if you don't have time to do much exploring.",3.4
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We loved it here, make sure you plan to spend a good few hours here and see all it has to offer, the displays are all well worth seeing as are each of the gardens and areas .. don't miss the smaller aviaries and water gardens, there's so much to see and learn",4.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Inevitably busy, with groups arriving and leaving all the time. It was useful to hear some guides briefing their groups. Walks around the base were varied enough, generally flat and well marked. Cultural information was given, but extensively ignored by many, including climbing the rock itself when specifically asked not to. The walk around the base is no doubt easier, but meets the exercise experience without the offence! Some groups started whilst we were there and luckily stopped when the full challenge became apparent, as many were neither fit enough nor dressed to tackle it safely. Over 100 people have died attempting this and the recovery of those getting caught out is expensive and carried out by the very people whose culture is not to climb the Rock. On a positive note make time to sit and absorb. Take fly repellent, although they take little note of it so a good head net is needed if you cannot ignore them; buy in advance! Try to get to different places to view sunrise and sunset over several days if you can as the light and conditions change so much.",3.2

If possible, go with a knowledgeable and entertaining tour guide (ours was Myles from AATKings) to get the full story behind the rock... geological, aboriginal and modern history. It was fascinating to see the string of ""ants"" making their way up the designated (and only) climbing route, especially after hearing about the 36 or so deaths from failed attempts... which, of course, just adds to the tension between the ""traditional owners"" and tourists who don't respect the culture. Saw a four or five foot sand goanna (big lizard) in the rocks near some aboriginal drawings. Nice Cultural Centre with exhibits, aboriginal art studio and store, gift shop, information desk, and bathrooms. Watching the sun set from the tour bus lot with wine and hors d'oeuvres was a bit of a zoo, and, while pretty, didn't live up to the hype in my opinion.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"This is certainly a must visit place if you're in Australia. It certainly was a magnificent experience to be up close at this UNESCO site of 600 millions years stone monolith. You have to be here to experience the sheer magnitude, size and beauty of changing colours according to sun ray - from light orange, brown, dark chocolate to brilliant red. As one walks along the base rim of the rock, you can see and feel what the Anangu people experienced here - crevices, gorges, some paintings. Several tours such as sunset, sunrise, dinners and drinks, camel rides, guided walk etc are available, but do book in advance as they can be fully booked upon arrival. The national park ticket entrance cost 25 dollars but valid for 3 days and there is also shuttle bus available to drop you at the park. The base walk is about 9.4 km walk and flat ground. For those who do not want to walk, you can also opt for Segway tours. Hat and face net is a must to avoid desert fly - they are harmless but can be annoying. It is sacred for the natives, so please if you can avoid it, do not climb up the stone - not everything has to be feat. Very glad I made it to this great place and hope to return some day again.

Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"The drive from Alice to Yulara (Uluru) will take you around 5 hours, please do not drive this in the late afternoon or on dusk, as you will be driving into the sun and the Lasseter Highway is statistically one of the most dangerous roads in the NT. You will not need a 4wd for any of this area, but I would recommend a Camry or larger (a full size car). As you approach Uluru you can probably have some fun with 'fooluru' (Mount Conner) There is only Yulara at Uluru, regardless of where you choose to stay it is going to be not cheap, for family friendly look at Outback Lodge or the Campground. Remember the climb **is closed** so if you were planning on that, forget about it. If your budget extends far enough a helicopter flight over the rock is well advised. If you line up Darwin for a Thursday you will be able to experience the world famous Mindil Beach Sunset Markets. As for Kakadu, book yourself in at Cooinda for night one, do the yellow waters cruise for sunrise, then move yourself up to Jabiru for sunset at Ubirr and then take in Nourlangie the next day, make sure you have tough walking shoes for all of this, and carry water. I would also suggest you invest in some UHF CB Radio handhelds (you may be able to rent these) as they help communicate car to car on the roads, Channel 40 for trucks and 18 for RVs, you may also want to consider renting a Personal Locator Beacon.",2.9

Why did it take half a century to visit? Sunrise visit is a must do - absolutely spectacular and we had amazing weather! Sunset is different and also very good - especially with champagne, canapes and a super moon to boot. Should you climb? I have mixed emotions on this vexing question. I will leave the decision to each individual, but aside from cultural and environmental considerations I can say that it looks quite dangerous. Uluru truly deserves its UNESCO world heritage double listing and is a spectacular natural wonder worthy of a visit by everyone. I felt privileged to make it here, even if it took 50 years.

Different birds are released from a hidden enclosure at specific times and fly right to the presenter. It's fascinating to watch birds - such as eagles, a bustard, a magpie, kites and an owl - interact with the presenter. An aboriginal man then told us how to make different implements. He was both amusing and clever. For lunch, staff from the Ghan had prepared a delicious array of salads featuring local ingredients and cold meats, plus lemon pie. We ate outside in the area of Madigans Restaurant. We then watched a movie in the theatre before having a Wander through the Woodland.

The rock is another one of Australias notable icons that people can instantly recognize like the Opera House, it’s a big red rock in the middle of a desert so people know it. We did a morning tour of Uluru, up super early to watch the sun rise at Uluru and then hiked up as it climbing was allowed when we were there.

The park located at the base of Macdonnell Ranges and is about a 10 minute drive from Alice Springs. The park is very well kept and it is great to see the diverse range of environments that have been created for visitors to walk through. An interesting talk offered during the day was the Aboriginal Survival in the Desert – stories from an indigenous guide. The guide provided a great insight into the past survival and traditions by the local indigenous communities. An absolute must do, and I recommend doing at the very beginning of your visit, is the watch the Changing Heart Big Screen Movie located in the cinema close to the entrance of the park.

Everyone should be able to enjoy mother nature AND treat it with respect. Should people leave their trash on Uluru or piss on it? Hell no! But someone should be able to hike up it. Like I understand the natives think some holy mumbo jumbo that if someone gets hurt on the rock, their soul is trapped there or something like that? I forget the details since it has been awhile since I looked into it. But basically no one gets to climb an amazing world wonder because of some ancient , backwards , nonsense beliefs.",2.2

It's a fantastic introduction to the different plants and animals you will be seeing as you drive and hike.

I took pictures of many of the little animal description signs to refer to later on our trip and was glad I did! It's always more fun when you can put a name to that odd tree you find or birdsong you hear. The park is rather large, so expect to do quite a bit of walking, but the paths are very well-maintained and level.

It's the Indigenous people who protect natural wonders like this, and argue against projects that degrade the environment. And your argument doesn't work because governments own the land where heaps of other culturally significant places are. Like the Colosseum, Stonehenge, every National Park in the US. Every piece of land is owned by somebody. The Indigenous people of Australia aren't just a people, they're a government too. So if you respect the rules when you go to a National Park, or when you go to the Empire State Building, or Notre Dame, or the memorial at Ground Zero, then you're going places governments own (and can destroy at any time), so you owe Uluru the same respect.",1.8

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The first time I came to Ayres Rock was in the mid-1970s when there was no National Park, you barely saw an Aboriginal person, there was certainly no expensive tourist trap of a resort and I climbed The Rock, signing my name in the book at the top without feeling I was doing anything wrong. I returned 4 years ago. The Rock is just as beautiful but how the place had changed. This year I decided that, since they are banning climbing the Rock in October 2019, I thought I would like to see if my considerably older bones could make the climb. I got about two-thirds of the way up but I'm not as fit as I used to be. I did, however, make the Base Walk which, apart from the areas to the left and right of the climb area is, in fact, fairly boring and a bit of a waste of 3 hours. In hindsight, it would have been much better to have hired a bike from the Cultural Centre, as there are plenty of places with bike racks where they can be left while you look at the more interesting areas. The Aboriginal stories about the various parts of the Rock are interesting but there could be more about the actual geological history of the Rock and less of the stories if it is intended to be educational to all visitors. One popular new attraction is to take a Segway tour of the Rock; however, this is not so popular for those trying to walk on the same tracks! The Cultural Centre hasn't changed in the last four years but it is worth a visit.",3.0
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We woke up early to see the sunrise. Tip: Don't follow the hoards to the viewing platform. The view is MUCH better on the walking path and you can walk right up to the rope and capture amazing photos while getting to enjoy some semi-solitude. In the distance you can also see The Olgas. It's quite something to see the sun come up and start reflecting off the plant life and then the rock itself. My boyfriend then climbed Uluru. I tried, but had a near meltdown at the small section before the rope (this is quite common as I sat near that spot for 2 hours and watched many people struggle with the same spot). Lots of people sliding down on their bottoms have polished that portion of the rocks, but my boyfriend told me that once you get to the ropes, the rock is much easier to walk on and that you can feel safe doing so.

We spent 5 days and the low point for us was the Field of Lights, good but somewhat disappointing perhaps because we were with a noisy group who spoiled the peaceful feeling.

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Nitmiluk is all about the gorges and what better way to see them than by rowing yourself in a canoe!! There are quite a number of gorges and depending on your fitness and tour option, some would be able to reach the fifth gorge. Your tour starts off with a ferry ride on the first gorge when there is an open commentary which will give you a brief background on the history and evolution of the area. Upon arrival at the second gorge, you will have to take a short walk to an area where you'll be assigned your canoe and given the rest of your gear. You can opt for a full day or half day - the latter you can choose to depart in the morning or afternoon. Once you are in your canoe, the pace is all up to you. It is relatively easy paddling both ways as there is only a very light current. You're given about 3.5 hours with the canoes - just remember that you'll have to paddle back the way you came so bear in mind the time. There is only 1 ferry back at 5pm so even if you arrive back early or had enough, you'll have to wait for the rest of your crew to return. I went as a family of 4 with young kids and we opted to just take it easy - enjoying the scenery and serenity. We managed to complete the entire course of the second gorge but decided to take a breather while the rest of the group went on ahead to the third. Bring lots of water as well but the ferry and the canoe docking area all have drinking water available to top up your bottles. We arrived back about 45 minutes early and was pleasantly surprised to find out that there was some rock art at the beginning of the second gorge. It will require you to navigate through the rocks separating the first and second gorge. On the way back, the ferry captain spotted a freshwater crocodile and did a u-turn for everyone to catch a glimpse. Overall a very enjoyable time with the family!

They had to agree to lease the land to the government for 99 years, and part of that agreement stipulated that they could close the climb when the proportion of visitors who climbed fell below 20%. Closing the climb has always been part of the plan, they just haven't been able to do it until now - the proportion of visitors who climb is now at 16%. And to be honest, for most people, just hearing 'the Anangu would prefer you didn't, and this is why' is enough. 84% of visitors to Uluru just hear that request, and respect it. Anangu culture places an emphasis on individual responsibility. They can educate you on why it's a jerk move to climb Uluru, but ultimately, it's up to you to take that information on, to weigh your options, and to take responsibility for your decision.",2.7

Reddit/friendlyjordies,Alice Springs Desert Park,Wow. This man and some people need to pull their heads in. Read through this thread as for 2 days now I have been disgusted by this media stunt in Alice Springs which is an obvious anti Indigenous campaign to support the 'No' stance disguised as pro indigenous support... problem is it's so obvious to most except the racists which want/need that food. Then you have any comment in this thread that adds some reason and insight into the case of there are serious issues within Indigenous communities attacked blindly with ignorant logic. Is everyone these days black and white in their thinking? Watched on ABC yesterday another speaker more or less state the issues in Alice Springs of both crime and other matters is no different to many other communities and real. They all need more and better support. Both sides of Government have neglected many things far too long resulting in where this country is today in this regard. Whether the concerns raised are in data or neglected so they do not appear in data is not the factual reality ever... the truth is often a combination of data and reality. In either case the bottom line is that using such issues for a political anti Indigenous stunt is disgusting. The likely fact that crime and other serious matters are worse than what is actually reported officially just highlights both sides of Government have let this country down through popular politics. This media stunt in Alice also highlights the opposite of its intended false agenda in that a voice might actually help improve some of these issues or at least not let them be forgotten as easily when it is not politically useful.,1.9

It was the best! If you ever go to Uluru DO NOT miss this. The next morning we took a Uluru Sunrise Tour run by AATKings. This was $69. Sunrise on the rock was lovely. After Sunrise we were driven around the rock and made a stop for photos before being driven to our resort for our buffet breakfast at Desert Gardens. After that we had the rest of the day to chat with the CAASTRA astronomer at Town Square and to listen to the Bush Tucker presentation by LEON. A visit to the museum is recommended with a 2pm presentation by the astronomer. A quick nap followed by Sounds of Silence dinner made for one fabulous day at Uluru!

He has a wonderful knowledge of the Mala men and their stories and was able to give us a brief cultural history. His intelligent and respectful talk was a highlight.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is the most breathtaking place I have ever visited. The landscape is beautiful, it’s peaceful, spiritual and full of unique cultural experiences that you can’t find anywhere else. I arrived during peak season but managed to book a cabin only a few weeks before departing on my trip (I think I got lucky). I recommend definitely booking well in advance if your travelling during peak season (June-September). For things to do, I highly recommend the sunset camel tour and add on the field of lights tour (if you’re there before March 2018) . It’s a unique way to travel through the desert and see Uluru in the background plus at the end you stop at a fantastic location and drink wine/beer and eat canapés while watching the sunset. The field of lights is a wonderful art piece that hasn’t been done anywhere else. From 8:00pm you will make your way through a maze of different colours in the middle of the dessert. Hire a bike for $45 and ride around the base of Uluru, stopping along the way to read all about the history and stories of the traditional owners of the land. Every afternoon head over to the sunset viewing area. Pack your camp chairs, fold up table, wine and cheese and set yourself up to watch the best show in town! There is an art centre, education centre and sometimes cultural shows plus everyday you can join a free guided walking tour to get that extra information about the oldest culture in the world! While your there don’t forget to go and see the Olgas, the sunsets there are amazing as well and there is a great walk you can do. You will not regret visiting Uluru, it’s a must see.

Firstly Anne on reception was incredibly kind nd helpful, so we started well. We both like taking photos, so even though we didn’t go on the official tours, we really enjoyed it, especially the aviaries. So many beautiful birds, breathtaking. We also enjoyed photographing the dingoes, walking through the red kangaroo enclosure, and the nocturnal house. It’s almost impossible to take photos there, as the lights are so low, but one of the keepers was putting out food and his head torch really helped. The highlight was the beautiful quoll and the bilbies. There are many little critters in there, including snakes, spiders and lizards, which little boys in particular would enjoy. The park is also lovely simply to walk around, a nice bush walk. And you never know what you might spot. The park doesn’t have a cafe, but has ice-creams and cold drinks. There’s also a nice little shop. All highly recommended.",4.7
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"A few years ago we went to the Alice Springs Desert Park for the first time after friends recommended it to us. This year we thought we'd go back for another look and found a few changes. We purchased our day pass and inquired about the Eagle Encounter we had seen advertised. At $20 for the two of us we considered it was reasonably priced so purchased a pass. The next 2 hours was spent wandering around the park. The birds and wildflowers were amazing. At 10am we lined up for the free flying bird show where Mel, the handler, showed us owls, falcons, galahs,and kites,explaining their different habits. It was an action packed 20 minutes and well worth it. After the show we wandered round some more until 11:30am when it was time for the Eagle Encounter. This is a small group session. We were escorted to the eagle by a very interesting gentleman who also took some really great photos of the two of us standing next to the wedge tail eagle. Once again it was Mel who told us all about this beautiful bird. Believe me, this session is well worth the money if you want to get up close to a wedge tail. We then spent the rest of our time wandering around this vast park and eventually spent five and a half hours there. It's also a great place for photos. The only disappointment for the day was the cafe. It did have a sign up apologizing for the limited service but at least we did get something to eat. Altogether it was a spectacular day and we left there feeling exhausted but very happy with our day.",4.1

The upper pool requires a level of fitness but take your time and enjoy the view going up. The upper pool has the famous waterfall edge and has panaramic views over the surrounds. But don't stop there. There is a further pool above this which can be accessed from a side track to the right as you decend into the first upper pool.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru is spectacular, rising out of the totally flat desert it's monolithic size leaves you stunned. The vibe here is just amazing. Walking/bike riding the base is a must. If walking is a challenge for you the road does go around the base and you can stop, park and do a short walk into the points of interest. The waterhole is a must as at start. People come here to enjoy the silence so keeping noise down would be considerate. The cultural centre is well worth stopping in for. Take plenty of water, and checking the weather for temperatures to choose a cooler day is a good idea. It's a desert dry heat. Also, pack a fly net to go over your hat, sometimes there are lots of flies which become annoying. Tips are book a 7 day stay as there are lots of other sites to visit such as Kata Tjuta and Kings Canyon, and hire a car - the roads are a very easy drive.

We were first there and more spectacular than the sunrise was the sky at night. We saw 2 shooting stars and you could faintly see the Milky Way. It was magical. Only downside is that eventually both sunrise an sunset get very busy after a lot of coaches arrive and it becomes very crowded. Lots of mobile phones and tablets lighting up distract from the sunrise. Our final tip was round the base of Ayres Rock where we saw all the Aboriginal paintings and sacred spots.

Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"You don't need a permit to visit Uluru, rather a pass to enter the national park it sits in (these do not require a specific application process). And yes up until I think either 2020, or 2019, you could climb the rock up to the top, but it was strongly discouraged, and they'd shut down the climb if it was even slightly windy. They've recently permanently closed the climb which is great. It is a sign of disrespect in the Aboriginal community to climb it. And it is also extremely disrespectful to remove pieces of the rock, even pieces that are on the ground, to take home. It is a sacred space. I visited in 2003 through my high school, and we walked around the rock instead. It was a 9km-10km walk and extremely warm! But a beautiful way to experience it. It was so fascinating to see all of the formations, little waterfalls, the Aboriginal rock paintings, and the view from the other side of the rock which often doesn't get shown in pictures and postcards -walking around the rock is well recommended if anyone gets the chance to visit! https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/do/walks/uluru-base-walk/",3.9

It's not far out of Alice Springs- there is a company that will take you there and bring you back, plus park entry fee for AUS$44, but it's easy enough to drive or cycle...or walk (takes about 1 hour from the centre of town).

There are social issues there as any city has and if you aren’t careful those issues can impact you (buy a dog, lock your doors, secure your car). The sporting facilities are fantastic and the social support is great- plenty of clubs and associations.

It's not far out of town, and there are many options, either a formal tour, part of the Gahn Railway trip, and, as we did, two seniors doing it ourselves. It's well sign posted, you are provided with a map, and any staff member is more than happy to assist you. Take water, and a hat, though there are plenty of drinking water taps throughout the grounds.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"In case you aren't aware why your comment is controversial and coping downvotes. Those situations aren't analogues.'Munich' and 'Florence' are completely different to 'Ayres Rock'. They're anglocised words. Foreign language words that are pronounced and written in a way that makes them easier for English native speakers to read and pronounce. The words have the same meaning and origin. 'Ayer's Rock' is not the anglocised word for 'Uluru' it it is a name chosen to honour Henry Ayre, South Australian Premier, by William Gosse. An analogue would be if the Hawaiian islands were instead called 'Cook Islands', or if Crimea was now renamed to Putinania. Like going to Botswana and referring to it as 'Bechuanaland' that name that the British gave the country while it controlled it's land. Or visit Sri Lanka and insist on still calling it Ceylon (the name used when it was a British colony, in reference to what the previous Portuguese colony called it).",2.4

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,A very memorable trip to Uluru and Kata Tjuta was a highlight of our Red Centre Experience. I was amazed and impressed with the ever changing colours of the rock and the Olgas. I preferred the Olgas but wouldn't go there without exploring both. The sunrise and sunset visits were well worth the effort but be early for both to get a prime position. I did not go there to climb the rock. It was a very steep looking climb.,4.4
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We didn't visit Uluru as part of any organised tours, we hired a car at the resort and made our own way to the rock. It is an awesome sight as you drive towards it. Of course there are other impressive rock features in many other parts of the world, but there is something special about Uluru: the way it rises up majestically from a flat desert landscape, the way it dominates the landscape for miles, and the way its appearance changes from smooth featureless rock to deeply pitted and gorged as you get closer to it, and of course the way it takes on different colours at different times of the day and from different perspectives. It is very popular with organised tours and, at busy times of the year, you may find yourself sharing the experience with lots of other people, especially at sunset. We drove out to the rock to see it at sunset and it was very special watching the colour change as the sun went down. At one stage it was that red colour that you see in all the classic photos. We went to the car park at the sunset viewing point. We arrived well before sunset and got a good place to view the rock but the car park soon filled up and there were lots of people. But, despite the crowds, it was peaceful, still and quiet throughout the sunset. Although technically walking up the rock is still allowed it appears that the Park Rangers find lots of reasons for prohibiting access. This did not bother us because we had no intention of walking up the rock as we wanted to respect the beliefs of the indigenous people for whom this rock has strong spiritual significance. But if your only reason for visiting is to walk up the rock, you will probably be disappointed. We completed the trail around the base of the rock. It took us about 2.5 hours. We didn't find it a challenging walk, it is flat with no climbs or descents but there is little or no shade, so we were in the full glare of the sun most of the way round. We started the walk about 30 minutes after sunrise at the end of October so it was quite cool at the start of the walk (I mean cool compared to later in the day) and didn't get too hot before we finished it. If you do the base walk you should take water, wear a hat and apply a high-strength sun block, especially if you do it in the afternoon. The trail goes close to the road at some points which is a bit disappointing, but there was little traffic on the road when we did the walk so it wasn't a problem for us. On one side of Uluru, the side of the Mala car park, the path takes you close to a few other short walks to places of interest which are well worth taking if they aren't too busy. This is the better half of the walk because you are closer to Uluru and there are more trees and shrubs, which provide a bit of shade and interest. On the other half of the walk you are are taken a little bit further away from Uluru and are a bit more more exposed to the sun (although that depends to some extent on the time of the day that you do the walk). Uluru is an awesome natural feature and it can be seen from several different perspectives (close up, at a distance, at sunrise, at sunset) each of which presents it differently. The base walk allows you to see Uluru right up close and to see the many natural clefts and fissures. There are information boards at various points that provide information about plants,wildlife and how the indigenous people lived at Uluru thousands of years ago. A couple of warnings. There are no toilets at any point along the base walk although there are some at the Mala car park and at the Information Centre, both of which are close to the trail. Also, although we were not bothered much, flies can be a big problem depending on the time of day and year. You will need a high-strength insect repellent and if you are doing the walk in summer you may need a fly net over your face.",4.0

It's lovely for sunset but make sure you give yourself enough time to get back down before it is dark.

As the rock has become a tourist attraction the new owners of the land let people climb the rock however the aboriginal people see it as very disrespectful as it’s sacred land to them. From October this year they are stopping people from climbing the rock out of respect to the aboriginal people which is good! I’m not an expert but just sharing what I learnt when I was there :)",3.0

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I climbed Ayers Rock this week and was lucky enough for a cool day with a light breeze. It is much harder than I expected! Take a minimum of 2L water for sure and plenty of sunscreen and maybe a hat. The first half of the climb is with the chain to help and I highly suggest holding it even with one hand as you climb as the rock is very slippery, even with good grip trainers it is very easy to slip. The second half once you have reached the top of the chain is slightly easier, as it is more flat with just a few steep small slopes here and there. I wouldn’t suggest taking pictures as you walk. Stop for a drink or for a picture etc then continue walking, the ground is very uneven and it would be very easy to lose footing and fall. Another tip I was given luckily before I done the climb was when coming back down the chain, go backwards. This way if you lose your balance and footing you won’t be falling forward and rolling down the hill. Instead, you would just be falling upwards and remaining safe. Also on some of the sections a lot of people even just slide down on their bum to keep their balance and stop themselves falling forward. Be very careful of how close to the edge you go for your looking out and pictures, the wind can pick up very quickly. It’s tough, I’m not gonna lie. And I have at least a moderate level of fitness. But I completed both up and down in around 1hr 50ish. Just take lots of little breaks when needed and keep hydrated then go again. When you get to the top of the chain and realise it’s only half way, it defo makes it seem doubtful if you can make it all the way if you really struggled with first section, but it is easier! And the feeling of accomplishment is awesome when you reach the end 💕",4.1

Went out for dinner at night, all fine. I think you'll find enough to do, the desert nature park is excellent and if it has reopened the evening tour is amazing (it wasn't open in 2021 but was when I went in 2013, when I also spent an early evening crying in the banks of the Todd River after a fight with a friend who I was staying with and still felt safe, even when approached by groups who just wanted to check that I was ok) the day and evening openings are compelling different so do both. Check the times of the bird shows etc because they are great. The reptile park was good if you are into that. Kids loved holding the snakes etc. I didn't do any of the technology stuff this time but have previously gone to the telegraph station, school of the air and the flying doctors head quarters, all great if they interest you.

After all, this is once in a Lifetime trip and we don’t think we will ever return as the price that one pays to holiday here does not justify a repeat trip. It is actually quite “Disgusting” for Ayers Rock Resort to charge Australians and us Tax Payers Top Dollars to enjoy a National Treasure!

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"You have 2 choices to see the Gorge. One is the high road and the other is the low road. The low road is a fairly flat and easy walk to a beach at the swimming hole in the gorge. The high road climbs up to a lookout at the top of the gorge's rim which both looks down the length of the gorge as well as on the swimming hole directly beneath. It is a long and steady mostly flat but always inclining path to the top. If you have the time, you can take the high road and then return to the low road to cool off in the water hole. The actual gorge is not all that impressive if your expectation of a gorge is tall vertical walls spaced closely together. Ormiston is not like that, being more of a valley between widely separated cliffs. The waterhole is said to be devoid of crocs, but they once said that about Wangi (see separate review) before one was captured there after an attack. So exercise caution!",3.4

But even if you don't go up to the top pools, the plunge pool at the bottom is amazing enough in it's own right. The top pools is probably more just one of those things you do to say you've done it. The road in was certainly challenging in places and we were lucky to go only a few days after it had been graded. Some people just drive too fast and you come around a corner to find them on your side of the road....so just be careful, but enjoy as it's a truly beautiful place.",3.7
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We tried to get into various tours but had left it too late as it was a last minute trip decision. So…. We walked and drove around Uluru with the Uluru audio guide and it was brilliant. We shared a set of ear buds and as we approached an area of interest or drove near vegetation etc e would hear stories and learn facts about culture, climate, European influence and history. We walked past so many people who could only read the signs and had no idea what they were looking at or walking past. Really really enjoyed it!",4.5

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I remember when we first came to Alice Springs back in 2006, we were advised to visit the Alice Springs Desert Park early, so we got there just after it opened. We ended up spending several hours there. We have been back every year since and it still remains as interesting as the first time, with new things seeming to be added each year. If you are interested in flora and fauna, this is the park to see. Starting at 7:30 am, it is a good time to start your visit, as rangers are feeding early in the morning. You should see the Big Screen Movie (love what happens at the end). The Bird Show is a must, and can vary depending on what creatures are available for the show. The animal enclosures are a must for the entire family including red kangaroos, emus and now the resident dingoes. If you are really lucky, you may even get to see the ranger walking them around the park. There are a number of walk-in avaries and of course the wonderful Nocturnal House. In the cooler months is the Eagle Encounter, a close encounter that you can capture on your camera for posterity. There are various ranger talks and as you walk through the park, you see examples of the different types of country. If you are able to, I highly recommend visiting the park at different times of the year, where you can experience the different seasons, including the wildflowers during spring. If you are here in the heat of summer, start your day early, bring blockout, a hat, a large bottle of water and comfortable walking shoes. As I write this, the new cycle path is nearing completion.

This time I drove here by myself, camped 3 nights at the caravan park and this time I enjoyed the park so much more. Having my own car and be able to drive into the park on my own made such a difference. I was able to go and see Kata-Tjuta and Uluru at sunrise and sunset and it was all much easier and cheaper than booking tour buses. I bought a parks pass for 3 days, I think it was no more than $25 - great value. To fight off flies I had a fly veil, that also makes the experience of the park so much more enjoyable when you don't have 1000s of flies buzzing your face. It's a shame though the park isn't open at night, I would have loved to photograph a startrail with either Uluru or Kata-Tjuta but the park closes shortly after dark. Weather was good, hot and sunny in March. Other told me there had been quite a bit of rain in the weeks before I went. All roads in and around the park are sealed.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Seeing Uluru is an amazing experience, we did our tour with AAT Kings one of the main operators in the Red Centre. We did the Base and Sunset tour which took us firstly on a base walk around one of the waterholes, the guide explained three of the Stories surrounding Uluru and why it is so important to the local people. The Guide also explained why they recommend not climbing the rock and this is for several reasons. The first is that 40 plus people have died climbing it. Then also Uluru is made of Sandstone with oxidized Iron Surrounding the Sand Stone, this is what gives Uluru its red colour but it is also preventing it from being eroded. You can see on the climb trail a line where from people climbing it is wearing off the Iron Protective layer. Also people who do climb tend to need to relieve themselves during the climb, this is causing a high level of E-Coli in the waterholes at the bottom of Uluru, this means the local animals can no longer drink from the waterholes. The Final Reason is the sacred nature of Uluru, and well you wouldn't want someone to climb your church. The Sunset viewing area is lovely and wine and nibbles were provided as part of the tour.

Reddit/geography,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I am currently working in an Indigenous community in South Australia (SA). Once a month, we usually travel to Alice Springs for grocery shopping and other necessities. It is an interesting place, largely because of its remoteness. As has often been pointed out, it is difficult to attract people to live and work there. especially for jobs considered “menial” or less specialized. For example, as a Canadian citizen on a Working Holiday Visa, one of my options to extend my stay in Australia beyond one year (for two or even three years) is to complete specified work in the Northern Territory (NT) in the service industry in places like Darwin or Alice Springs. This requirement means that I am far from alone: many Working Holiday Visa holders find themselves in Alice Springs, making it a surprisingly international town despite its isolation. At the same time, Alice Springs faces a complex social reality. Australia’s colonial past was devastating for its Indigenous peoples. Through violence, dispossession, and policies aimed at assimilation. Unlike in many parts of the country, the Anangu people survived largely because they lived deep within Central Australia’s desert lands, which were difficult for settlers to exploit. Today, the Anangu remain very much present and active in their communities and culture. Yet serious challenges persist. Education is particularly difficult to deliver in such remote areas. Access to everyday services and infrastructure ; ** things most Australians take for granted ** is often limited or absent ; We had to close the school due to vicious dogs attacking people. I once couldn't get my click & Collect order at Coles (grocery store) because someone died there a few days prior. Many communities struggle with high rates of unemployment, alcohol and substance abuse, and what was once widespread petrol sniffing. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians in very remote areas is more than four times higher than for non-Indigenous Australians. Life expectancy remains about 8 years lower for Indigenous people compared to the national average. Trying to undo more than two centuries of colonial dispossession is a task that remains extremely challenging.",2.9

While during the hotter hours I recommend to attend all the (free!) ranger talks and activities, as they ""sharpen the senses"" what to look out for, visit the ""night house"", and then just wander around again from around 3.30/4pm, as the animals become active again, which makes it so much easier to spot them by yourself. The park closes at 6pm - which would be great if that could be extended until sunset, as the park and the colours become simply magic and make for some excellent photo opportunities as well. - The staff were extraordinarily friendly and knowledgable, the talks and guided walks interesting. - Many benches to rest in the shade and water fountains.

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"This cruise is not that well know but I know it has been around a couple of years at least. A 4.30 start and 8.30 finish, it is not cheap at $140 but totally unique and a wonderfull experience. Some walking included but it is an easy walk of no more than 600m twice. The scenery in the three gorges you visit is superb especially at that time of the day with the sun setting and beautifull reflections. The guide as informative and friendly and the boat comfortable being able to move around to take a photos.mfree chilled water supplied. The food was cooked on the boat and a choice of barramundi and prime steak for the main course. A glass of champagne and Kirsty prior dinner. The starter of crocodile (yummy), kangaroo and dips was superb. Desert was wonderfull as well. Alcohol is not included apart from the champagne but the prices were very reasonable, better than most restaurants. The fact the food is coked fresh on the boat and the superb scenery makes this a unique and wonderfull experience not to be missed.",4.1
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Excellent animal displays and guided activities in a beautiful natural setting. A half day at least is a must and don't miss the bird of prey show. We were thrilled to learn the reason they don't have Wedge Tailed Eagles in their bird show anymore is there is a wild pair that can be seen circling the cliffs above the park - I love places like this that really care about nature. The staff and guides were excellent and very knowledgable and passionate - makes for such a great experience. The nocturnal exhibit is a great escape from the heat and also had cool reptiles like the Thorny Devil - which we didnt get to see in the wild,4.7

TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Ormiston Gorge is a wonderful place but if you are interested in doing the walks, allow some time. There was a bit of water in the gorge while we were there so the last bit of the track you had to choose between climbing down a steep rock or getting wet. Most people walked into the Gorge which is only a 5 minute walk and also then walked up to the lookout and then came back down rather than doing the complete circuit walk. The road is sealed all of the way and is easily accessible from Alice and back in a day. There is a nice little kiosk for drinks and food.",3.4

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"After checking in at the resort climb the Imalung lookout in the middle for an overall view.There's another lookout about 500m south of the Outback Pioneer that’s worth a look also. We went on the free tour provided by the park rangers. Worth doing but don't be shy and ask questions. The tour is an easy 2-3km in June and takes about 2hours. The walk around the rock in total is about 13km; there's two spots for water but NO TOILETS so I hope you have a better bladder than me. The cultural centre is interesting. If you want to buy a indigenous artwork there's actually two shops, the second near the exit. We hired a car for the three days (book online before you go) and drove to see Uluru both a sunset and sunrise. The colour of the rock I felt didn’t change that much but the sky was amazing. We also drove out to Kata Tjuta and walked the short version of Valley of the Winds (I think). Again, only the parking area has water and a toilet. First hour of the walk is OK but after that the tracks is strewn with large rocks making walking difficult. Though we didn't do it, dusk and dawn would be awe inspiring here as well. If visiting Australia it has to be on your bucket list.",3.6

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We visited Ayres Rock (Uluru) in November and it was simply jaw droppingly beautiful. We were incredibly lucky that the weather was cool for the time of year and we even had a little rain. We arrived at Uluru to watch the sunset from the sunset viewing area and it was an amazing site to behold. We then stayed locally and got up at 04:30 to watch the sun rise and again, it was a real treat. For the sunrise there were four or five coaches plus people, like us, who had got themselves there and so the viewing platforms were quite busy even by 05:30 (sunrise was 05:57). I would recommend getting there early and finding your spot - some of the paths around have really good views too.

And that's not said with disrespect but we will never remember them, but we will remember stories of life for Indigenous Australians, herbal medicines, food, etc. Another problem is that it is stated the park shuts at 7.30pm. Well of course it can't as the main road to WA goes straight through it. But being law abiding people we respected that, but it means that the astral photography that we wanted to do was cut short.

It's nothing short of amazing that Australia has indigenous Australians with direct lineal decent to this land and the culture. No other country has a living 80,000 year old people who still know their culture inside out. I lived in Japan for a while and their indigenous Ainu people are dead. Wiped out! While Japan now has lots of cool castles and stuff, they will never recover their indigenous culture, which is completely lost. Show some fucking pride in your country and respect the owners who are just trying to preserve the world's longest surviving culture!! It's fascinating shit and something I'm far more proud of than a fucking meat pie and VB. 3. It's actually the whole national park that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so it's prohibited '[t]o commit any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples'. In all honestly, we should feel privileged that the owners even let us into the national park.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,My cousin was a ranger there when we visited. I had given my family the choice of whether they wanted to climb it before we got there even though I had decided not to myself. After talking to him about the reasons why the local community were not in favour of visitors ascending the rock they also pulled the pin. Basically it comes down to people being injured or killed while climbing. The locals felt there was a duty of care on them to look after visitors to their land and deemed themselves failing that duty when something happened. While not explicitly stated the another reason it seems was that they regarded the spirit of those who lost their lives climbing the rock would remain at the site. Indigenous people can be incredibly superstitious and having strangers spirits wandering their place was certainly an uncomfortable thought. That is not to say they were alone in their superstitions. The mail room contains basket after basket of packages from around the world containing rocks that were taken from Uluru but sent back after visitors later learned it was bad luck to remove them. The rangers could not return them without knowing exactly where they came from so instead they continued to be stored at the center. In the end we walked the perimeter and we really glad we did. There were a couple of areas out of bounds but some of the permanent water holes and other sites were pretty awe inspiring. I'm glad the climbing will stop in 2019. edit: grammar.,3.4

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Historically names change over time, new people overcome the old and change names to suit their beliefs. This has happened since the beginning of time. I am sure the Pygmy peoples that populated the coastal land prior to aboriginal settling in those areas had names for landmarks and when they were conquered by the new comers the names were changed and so the cycle continues. However I am not saying either name is wrong what I am saying it does not matter. What matters is we get past this them and us crap and work together to create a new Australia. At this moment we are reliving the past as if it is the future. We as one nation need to get past this finger pointing and guilt complex that seems to drive the hatred between our population. Yes there is racism on both side of this argument, driven mainly by poor education and fear mongering. Through social media the young people of today have a never before opportunity to bring this nation together and force governments to interact with not just the wealthy but every person in this country from the smallest of Outback communities to the largest cities. But no, they would sooner enforce social propaganda ideals risen from partial truths and bad teaching. It has been proven time and again throughout history that when something is forced onto a populous they will rebel. Uluru is a good example of this, as mentioned it was restored to its original name in the 80’s and the name grew up with the children. However, when the rule came out preventing ppl climbing it there was no explanation, no story, so ppl rebelled. In the 80’s ABC had 5 minute animated story that spoke of the dreaming, around the time kids were sitting down to watch cartoons etc, this helped the young understand, including some of us that were not taught culture because of their parents fear. Since then even some of the aboriginal children have lost their true culture and rely on media driven catch phrase education to try and get their frustration across which in turn helps no one and fuels more hatred. The time for recompense is gone, the time for joining is now we all need each other, we see the world outside Australia falling apart and here we are bickering over the mistakes of history, we can be better than that, we are better than that.",2.8

Taking three young boys to Uluru as a solo parent was not an appealing proposition - too far, too restrictive, too expensive for the quality of the experience. Easier by far to take them to Fiji etc, or just to places like the Gold Coast or Port Douglas.",2.5

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"We spent two glorious days visiting this park. On the first day we took a boat cruise down the gorge. The guide was truly knowledgable and rightly very proud of the heritage of the Jawoyn people and their land. Our big surprise was the food in the visitor centre. Small menu but everything was of such excellent quality, even the freshly made sandwiches. One the second day we visited Edith falls at the other end of the park. The falls and lake are wonderful. The falls are a decent swim out across a deep lake and there is a bit of current pushing away from the falls. If you are not a strong swimmer take a pool noodle and approach the falls from the left hand side.",4.3

Will never forget this trip.",4.7
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I’m conflicted on this issue, downvote me all you want. A few years or months ago I thought of the same thing many people think about Uluru, “respect the true owners of the land” and “disrespectful tourists” ect. However when I actually visited Uluru from Melbourne for a school excursion earlier this May my whole view changed completely. My tour guide was the best, wise and truthful person (I forgot his name) but anyways he told us that the whole deal of closing down climbing the rock and the signs that say not to were all done by the media to manipulate and misconstrue us, play a narrative that white Australians think they’re doing the right thing by doing useless things such as closing down Uluru for no reason. He told us the real reason why Indigenous Australians are upset is that Uluru itself is a rock and has no sacred value. What does are certain parts and areas where traditions have been held (such as child birth) they were called ‘sensitive sites’ and were asked not to take photos. The issue is when tourist disrespect these wishes and not respect the area. Our tour guide actually encouraged us to get on the rock (not climb) our teachers were taken back because they were aware beforehand of the situation. The tour guide did tell us it was a good thing they were banning closing it down because of deaths due to the lack of safety and you get the same view of the place on the ground. The trip really opened my eyes and as I said before, I’m conflicted. You may not believe me but I encourage you if you’re an Australian to make the trip to Uluru once in your life. Tdlr: Went to Uluru and found out media manipulates us when Indigenous Australians didn’t actually care that much about the ban. Edit: I didn’t climb Uluru out of respect of the Indigenous Australians and Uluru look way better from a distance anyway.",1.8

The heat is very powerful so make sure you take plenty of water, sunscreen and cover up! We bought fly nets to go over our hats at the airport and were delighted we had when we got there.

But buy acknowledging the inconvenient fact that many people around the world might not, **I’m** the ignorant one??? You’re putting words in my mouth.

You fix something (perhaps superficially in some cases, not this one) and pretend everything is fine and dandy across the world. Then when Americans actually acknowledge the inconvenient truth that we have a long fucking way to go everyone points out how racist just because we address issues we can’t tackle instead of pretending they don’t exist. Do I know American education is lacking? Of course, we just had a clown for President for four years(no insult to clowns intended). But I don’t have a solution to that. And what do I get for pointing out that people may not know a pretty minor fact? I get shit on. I’m trying to be helpful buy making context available. But the moment it was re-renamed everyone and everything across the globe was supposed to magically have all instances of “Ayers Rock” replaced with “Uluru” apparently, so my bad I suppose. I’ll also have you know we’ve done the same thing, Mt. McKinley was renamed Denali at some point, the original name. This was a bit of a smoother transition though because as far as I know the National Park was always Denali NP.

We do a lot of walking, so readily choose to walk around the base of Uluru. At first we were excited, as the path hugged the base of Uluru and there was lots to see and explore. However, as you walk around the base, the further you get away from it. After a while, it is like walking in the distance of the rock, it the heat and sun, with limited change in the scenery. It was extremely disappointing, especially with young children. In retrospect we should have just driven to the key points of the rock and explored them or hired some bikes. Walking around the rock with no pram and small children, is not worth it. Kings Canyon Rim Walk and The Valley of the Winds are much better options, than the base walk of Uluru.",2.8

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Im admittedly slightly racist. Not in a direct way. I've never discriminated against a person for the colour of their skin. But I do not like or respect aboriginals. To answer your question on why. - they consistently take from the system. Grants, money, welfare, all from taxpayers. Yes, they were mistreated severely years ago. But as a migrant to this country, that wasn't me nor my family. Why should I have to pay for the mistakes of British settlers. - they have every advantage in every aspect of everything. They can hunt any animal they want, they get preference treatment in jobs, in schools, universities, medical facilities, they can enter national parks for free and kill protected animals. They have their own court and some laws don't even apply to them? - they're more violent and criminal than the rest of society. Look at the crime rates of aboriginals. It's ludicrous. How do we just accept what they do in Alice Springs? - every encounter I've had with an aboriginal is negative. As a teenager they were anti social and violent. As an adult they have screwed me when I allowed them to rent my house and caused thousands in damage. - they are constantly looking for handouts. They've figured out the system is virtue signalling and are fully playing into it for the advantages they recieve. - welcome to country at every. single. Opportunity. Is this necessary? To be forced to sit through a welcome to country all the time? Its ridiculous. At the right times it's a beautiful thing. My partner got a citizenship and they did one at the ceremony, it was done by an aboriginal who did some traditional dances and stuff and it felt right. It doesn't feel right when Karen from HR does a welcome to country every time a meeting is held. - white people seem to continuously push this agenda, if you feel obliged to help aboriginals Go and volunteer or sacrifice your own income to help them. Don't drag others into it. Being forced to embrace something you don't really believe in causes resentment. - most of the people in Australia have done nothing to aboriginals and owe them nothing ! This is becoming a greater % as immigration. I get that the British descendants may want to pay reparations in the form of welfare to aboriginals. But this is not the responsibility of the immigrant to funnel our tax dollars into this cause. Ultimately I do not care about aboriginals as long as they don't take my tax dollars for anything and don't commit crimes against me and don't get special laws made just for them.",1.8

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Intrepid / Adventure tours, and in particular, our guide - the knowledgeable, entertaining, enthusiastic, well organized, hard working and always good humoured, Joe - helped make this bucket list item memorable and magical. Yes, it's a long way from anywhere, but that's part of the desert experience. Pick up the tour in Alice Springs to get a true feel for the real Australian outback on the journey to Kata Tjuta - valley of the winds; sunset champagne and sunrise Base walk around Uluru should not be missed; and the Kings Canyon Rim walk, while maybe a bit challenging for those afraid of heights like myself, but definitely doable if you're physically up to climbing 450 steep bush steps plus some clambering up and down rocks - an awesome walk! Go for the ""glamping"" option to enjoy a comfortable night in a bed with linens, it's not much more cost wise but worth it - you'll also have electricity to recharge cameras etc. Don't expect 5 star cuisine but the camp hosts do a good job of providing plenty of food,including vegetarian option (if you let them know when you book). Will definitely recommend this trip to all our friends, Aussie and others and look forward to arranging our next adventure through Intrepid / Adventure tours. Thanks, Joe!",4.4

A short ride back to a gorgeous rock pool where we had exclusive use of the pool while Tom, our awesome pilot went for a walk. Even though I was terrified, Tom made me feel very safe and I found the 3 hours absolutely exhilarating. Tom definitely deserves a pay rise and this tour is worth every cent!! We followed this with the fabulous sunset dinner cruise that night so we could see the gorge up close.

Many of the talks by local indigenous aussies concerning, desert survival, plants/animals and bush tucker! Do catch the bird show as well! The nocturnal and reptile display also shows many an animal that one would be hard pressed for one to see in the open or without a very keen eye! The little spinifex mice were adorable...

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The Alice Springs Desert Park has a fine collection of native birds and a respectable display of reptiles and smaller mammals in the Nocturnal House. The grounds are very well done and their are quite a few information shows available, as well as providing free audio guides. The park, minus shows, can probably be completed in about 2 hours, which is fair seeing the price of admission is about the same as a movie ticket in Alice Springs. We were very much looking forward to the wildlife show, but found that we only got to enjoy a small portion of it, as a scheduled tour got a pre show were asked to remain for a further show after we were left. Several local raptors and other birds were presented, but I had higher expectations based on word-of-mouth. Why only average? This place will delight bird fans, but the displays are relatively repetitive. I enjoyed the grounds but they are nothing you will not see if you travel a bit further down the road and hit any location in the Western MacDonnel Ranges.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Uluru is a wonderful sight and the various walks and viewing platforms make for wonderful pictures. As of 26 October 19 the walk into the rock will be closed. Kings Canyon some 400km is a must plus a visit to the stations on the way there is worth while. Also on the other side of the Rock is what was known as the Olga’s which is also worth a visit. Just be aware the accommodation and food is really expensive so budget accordingly,3.7
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Enforcement is an interesting question. I’m not from the Northern Territory but work in a related field in a different state. It’ll be protected under the applicable heritage legislation. So at a state level, that would be the Heritage Act 2011 (iirc). Once the climbing ban is enacted, people could possibly face penalties for not complying with the site protections. So IF the site registration, management plan and resulting protections specifically disallow climbing (or access) in the future, it is a prosecutable offence. I think some of those penalties can involve jail time, if successfully prosecuted to that level. Part 5.5 of the Heritage Act 2011 that outlines the specifics. I know that Uluru is UNESCO World Heritage Listed, so there’s commonwealth regulation / management under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (iirc). But I think that legislation is more intended to establish the management / protection framework than provide grounds for enforcement - that’s administratively better done at a state level. Also Uluru is held by the Anangu people in native title. (and maybe other property rights, Northern Territory native title / land rights are not my area of expertise). There is a 99 year lease in place to the Government, which allows the National Park to be managed under statute - which is important from a visitor control and management perspective. The National Park Board of management can likely take enforcement action against visitors who attempt to climb Uluru after the ban. Might be in the same way that littering and other infractions against the rules of visiting the park are managed - fines and such. These are generally enabled through the legislation and regulations that apply to managing the National Park, which differs state to state. I personally believe that they’re starting off softly, and hoping visitors will do the right thing. If the climbing ban isn’t respected, the management body and the State Government will likely have to look at enforcement mechanisms and decide how to best apply what is available (such as via my above vague description of options).",3.3

This is a well set out park in sections representing ""desert"" areas in the outback. Tree and bush planting is excellent and expect to see birds aplenty. The main attraction is a bird of prey show and it is really worth a look. The birds enter on cue and delight with their display. We see them up high but here you see them up close. The show was amusing in that a wild crow was upstaging everything. It may not be there for later shows but I suspect it knows a good thing. Another highlight is the nocturnal area where Bilbies, Numbats, Quolls etc hang out. These are animals we rarely see but you will see them here ( hopefully). They are flighty little things so maybe in cover but if you are there for feeding you will see them. There are also some reptiles which are always fun to see up close.

There are plenty of wild birds around, but there are also about 8 good sized aviaries with plenty of central Australian birds. A couple of them are walk in aviaries. All the displays have good signage. The bird display was excellent, lasts about 20 minutes with a half a dozen different trained birds.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"It has been one of our lifetime ambitions to see this natural spectacle. It was an amazing experience overall but there are some things to be aware of if planning a trip here. To see the rock a national park pass is required which costs 25 dollars per person and is valid for three days. You have the option of joining a tour (coach, mini bus, bike) or using your own vehicle or hire car to tour the park which includes Uluru, the Kata Tjuta range and the cultural centre which is close to Uluru. The tours are not cheap so if you are in the area for few days you will incur some high costs to join the tours or you will be restricted to your hotel/ campground (Assuming you are staying at the Ayers Rock resort area) from which the rock is not directly visible. We opted to join a tour for one day and hire a car for the remainder of our stay. It is also worth me mentioning the flies - they are not apparent in the photographs but will become a memorable part of the experience! We were disappointed in the cultural centre in the park.

We actually went there 3 times, once on the way to Wauchope Hotel and then came back for the Sunset and Sunrise the next day. The rocks, colour, light and feel are just superb. A definate ""must see"" on any ones list. What really did surprise us however was the great number of caravans parked at the rear of the site, but noone in sight. We seemed to have the whole area to ourselves and were able to take heaps of fantastic photos. For photographers.. it is magical. Maybe the very cold wind had something to do keeping people away.",3.6

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We did two tours with AAT - one was a Sunrise over Uluru... the other sunset..... Must dos!!!! Valley of the Winds Tour - Day 2 - Sunrise at Uluru. .. and the magic of the Valley of the Winds at Kata Tjuta (Olgas)... one of the guides described Kata Tjuta as one of the unsung heroes compared with Uluru. ... I have to agree! Another early start but beautiful view of Uluru and Kata Tjuta as the sun rose made it worth it. AAT got us there early and in prime spot. Then off to Kata Tjuta for a tour of Valley of the Winds. AMAZING!!!! Truly spectacular. Worth it! Day 3 - Sunset and Uluru walk - Aboriginal cave paintings. ..

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Its shape is so well known that there is a chance seeing it form a distance for the first time will be an anti-climax. However, travel to its base and see its features close up to fully appreciate both its enormity and its weathered texture. Some sides of the rock are sign-posted as sacred according to aboriginal culture and photos are banned, but unless there is a ranger around (unlikely), the policy is unenforceable. People say that the rock's colours change as the sun rises and sets. We attended the latter and witnessed no discernable change. There are many events held around the rock at sunrise and sunset. We attended two: Field of Light at sunset (Poor, see separate review) and Sounds of Silence (OK, see separate review).",3.6

The highlights include a dingo enclosure (make sure you listen to the guide presentation), a bird show with very talented birds (but could go for at least double the time length) and a very good nocturnal display. Was expecting a bit more of the Australian mammals like kangaroos and emu’s which was something I expatiate see quite a lot of. There were many bird aviaries, possibly too much of a focus on them. In the evenings there is a guided nocturnal walk that you must book in advance especially in peak season. That was very special as we saw bilbys, malas and echidnas.",4.0

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"What an interesting night. We went along to the Nocturnal tour last night at the Desert Park and it was a lovely experience with lots of opportunities to see some of the amazing native animals that come out at night. Due to the introduction of various feral animals in the region you won't get to see these animals generally, but here behind a huge double electric fence they are safe to wonder around and due to some very careful planning as you walk around the paths that wind through the bush land you can see them. On our trip we got up close with the strange looking Bilby, the cheecky bush rat (more like a large guinea pig with a tail), Marla's and several other of the smaller kangaroo type animals - can't remember their names was so focussed on the actual animals didn't really hear all of what our very informative guide was saying. About half way through our hour long walk we all had to stand very still while a very unconcerned Echinda made it way through the group of us on the path and eventually off into the bush and we even managed to see a bearded dragon asleep up in the branches of a tree - up out of the way of any snakes (which I'm glad to say we didn't see any of tonight). Our guide as great at answering all types of questions - from locals and overseas visitors alike and we even got some pointers on the various stars and how to navigate. So all you need is a pair of enclosed shoes, a water bottle and an hour on evening - the park supply infrared headlights so you can see your way once it does get dark and the guide has a really big spotlight (infrared so not to scare the animals off) and I would have liked my light to have been a little bit stronger so I could see a bit off into the bush while walking along not just a bit in front of me but still saw more than I thought I would. So here are a couple of tips - try to go on a new moon - animals more active then on a full moon, if want photos need a camera that can use at night without a flash otherwise bye bye animals. I also found that once an animal/s is spotted and the group stops just stay back a bit and squat down and stay very quiet - the spot light might be focussed on one animal but the chances are there are others and these if all is quiet will come really close to see what is going on. Overall a great experience to see what Central Australia has to offer especially as you can't get to this area during the day as it is a restricted area.",4.0

Strongly recommend visiting the Anangu Cultural Center BEFORE you walk around the cliff. There are free tours, where a ranger will walk with you and tell you about the traditions and myths surrounding this place. With some of this backgound info, you will appreciate what you see much more and gain a deeper understanding. Some even have a spiritual experience in the presence of the unique rock or monolith! And PLEASE respect the traditions of the Anangu, and don't climb the cliff!! Stroll around, absorb the atmosphere. Some parts of the cliff should not be photographed - please respect that!

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"> maybe there is some vast Australian conspiracy to convince the world that tourists have taken a shit at Uluru, Pics or it didn't happen. Right now there are RECORD numbers of people climbing the rock - every cunt has a smart phone on them 100% of the time. So where is the evidence? I've got pictures of fucking FISH that live up there on the rock! (Wanna see? I'll post them) The top is awesome, amazing, spectacular! Climbing is an achievement - it's very, very difficult and dangerous - I don't know if you've noticed that there's not much/ anything to climb in Oz? There are only 4000 Aboriginals in the local tribe that lay claim to the rock and the most vocal critics are guilty white slacktivists, like you. I hope you never lay eyes on the rock, and if you're ever lucky enough to get out there **I hope you get a yearning to climb**, it's a natural feeling for some people and I'd fucking LAUGH if it happened to you and the fucking thing was closed. lol. I've climbed twice, I've got no kids, I care that it's closing but it no longer affects me directly. It's also mega expensive to get out there and to stay there. It's privilege for the elite, really, I believe that's how they are able to get so much support for the closure. Poor people will never experience the rock so they have nothing to lose with the added bonus of a feeling of superiority. (does it feel good OP?) ya dickhead. No one shits up there, those claims are outright lies. Show me some photographic evidence of it and I'll apologise.",2.9
Reddit/UFOs,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Alice Springs… The Aboriginal tribes saw the v-shaped UAPs millennia ago, flying thru the skies in their area and also returning. They even created boomerangs as representations of what they saw and created their own “technology” with it (the boomerang for hunting). Soundwave tech witnessed by them was eventually culturally absorbed as didgeridoos. Their paintings show the beings and orbs and saucers, and they absorbed that culturally as well. One crashed long ago or simply landed and later malfunctioned in some way, stranding it in place. The shifting winds and lands covered most of it very well over time, and when later discovered by the whitees, they figured they should bury their treasure until they could come back for it and exploit it in full. Much later, they put a building over it to fully secure it… then a BASE to secure it even further and practically guarantee its safety and future utility.",3.9

Once you get there, there is a gorgeous green, watered camp site with toilet facilities. The pool at the base of the falls is gorgeous with a beach area which is wheelchair accessible and great for kids and those with limited mobility. If your more energetic, the climb to the top of the falls is worth the effort. This is where the Infinity pools are situated. It is lovely, but go early, because it gets busy, and the pools are not big.

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"There is a 30+km gravel access road to Gunlom, which is quite corrugated at times, and very very dusty, so go slow when passing vehicles travelling in the other direction.

The camp ground is very good, plenty of camps available (generator and non-generator areas) with good toilets and showers. The climb up to the top of Gunlom waterfall is quite steep and hot at times, so take some drinking water with you. It's worth the climb to experience Gunlom. At the very top, enter the pool, and swim over some shallow rocks to get to the ""back"" where there is a small waterfall. It is just gorgeous.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"For sure, this desert park is more than ""a park in the desert"" with big enclosures for birds (some can be gone in & some just to look through the glass), a building for nocturnal animals (with big display cases inside), feeding shows (in the areas of the kangaroos & dingoes) & a bird show (at an amphitheater area); but if there were one word to describe this place, it would be the word ""scanty"" - not many birds at all inside the enclosures, nocturnal display cases where you can ""hardly"" see any creature and where in fact the whole interior of the building is ""too dark"" to see much at all (not sure if that's just the way it's supposed to be being a place for nocturnal animals, and yes the display cases themselves are ""pretty creative""), and my ""biggest disappointment"" being the bird show at the amphitheater area where the show consisted of ""exactly one"" bird which was a small one about the size of a parrot; the feeding shows though are something I can't comment on since I missed them all arriving at about 1 30 pm (I believe all their feeding shows take place ""fairly early"" in the morning), but I kind of doubt there are that many animals to feed here for those feeding shows to be worthwhile (I went over to the kangaroo area and saw just three kangaroos which is nothing comparable to the ""impressive number"" I saw later at Lone Pine Sanctuary in Brisbane although yes the three I saw here are like ""twice the size"" of those at Lone Pine). But yes, apart from being pretty average at its live displays (as mentioned above), this place I would say is pretty great at ""educational"" displays (there's a lot you can learn about the Australian Outback & how the aboriginal people lived in the desert for centuries from the big info displays all over the park grounds), and also there are info sessions (for desert herbs & such) & a documentary show at the cinema room inside the main building. Coming by public transportation, there's a bus you can take from the stop across the street from the Post Office in the CBD, but the driver put up the 'Out Of Service' sign at 12 noon (not sure if that's usually the case in this city which is actually just a small town), so I ended up walking for about an hour & a half along Larapinta Drive (heading west from the CBD), but the walk was actually ""not bad"" going past the ""neat & pleasant"" suburbs on the outskirt of town (even if you take the bus, you'll still have to walk about 15 minutes from where you get off which is the stop on Larapinta at Albrecht Drive). In any case, considering the cost of 30-something dollars for this place, it is actually ""more worthwhile"" in my opinion to visit Olive Pink Botanic Garden (all the way to the east from here on the opposite side of town) where you can also have a ""nice feel"" of the desert similar to here (just minus animals & info displays) and for ""absolutely no cost"".",3.4

The staff appeared not to really know what they were doing and had no idea how to make coffee. I know we weren't there for the food, but we needed to eat and it was in the middle of our visit.

Yes, it takes forever to get there, but part of what made Uluru so magical to me was its appearance in the middle of nowhere after a six-hour bus ride from Alice Springs. Photos can't do justice to its immensity and the stark contrast it provides to the landscape around it. But it only got better as we approached Uluru, and explored its crooks and crannies as we walked around it. My only regret is that we did not have enough time to hike the entire way around it. It was amazing to see it for myself. We also saw it at sunset and got up early the next morning to catch it at sunrise. The colors and the shadows changed constantly as the sun descended in the evening and rose in the morning.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There are so many things to do near and around Uluru, something to suit every level of interest and fitness. We were amazed constantly how big it was, from any angle that we saw it, and how it sits there upon the landscape drawing all eyes to it. I could have looked at it all day. To get into the National Park you need to buy a parks pass, which lasts 3 days (you can buy at the entrance to the park as you drive in, or pre-purchase). We paid $65 for a family. We went in early one morning to watch the sunrise over Uluru - it was magnificent. There were a lot of people there and it would pay to arrive early to get an unobstructed view - we came just before sunrise so walked around to find a good spot and had a few trees in the way but it was still amazing. We returned later in the day to do the base walk. This is a long walk (about 10km) and would be extremely hot on a sunny day, we were lucky and had overcast weather, it would be best to start early in the morning to beat most of the heat. There are a few water fountains around the track so you can top up water bottles. The rock is so varied and interesting all the way around, so many different aspects of it to see, and the foliage around the base varies greatly as well. There are areas which are sacred and the local people request that no photos be taken there - there are plenty of places where photographs are allowed so it's easy to respect their wishes and still record the trip. There is a guided walk each morning to part of the rock, which explains a lot of the significance of the area. We didn't do this but friends who did said it gave them a greater insight to the area. The visitors centre has a cultural discovery centre which gives some of the history of the area and is fascinating. The gift shop has lots of local art and products for sale, and at times the artists are there working on their paintings which was great to watch. It is also possible to ride bikes around the base, my husband and daughter returned the next day and did the ride and found it so much quicker and a very fun way to explore Uluru. We also came back to watch the sunset, there are dedicated carparks to get the best view. it was still cloudy so the colours were not as brilliant as sometimes seen, although the sun popped out for about 30 seconds to bathe Uluru in an amazing orange light, it was incredible. The park closes at a specific time each night (depending on when sunset is) - there are no overnight stays allowed in the park, so make sure you are out before the gates shut.",4.4

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I somewhat agree, however her political competence has been vastly exaggerated due to media sensationalism. For example, arguably at the height of her recent political career, her performance in the 2017 Western Australian and Queensland Election was abysmal. In WA, she got less than 5% of the vote with merely two upper house seats won while in Queensland she got 13% with only 1 seat yielded (this is despite Queensland being the home of her loony party). In both elections there were massive predictions for her party but they all fell short. Additionally, this can partially be explained by her campaigning. I can't recall the exact details, but I remember she made some embarrassing mistakes in WA when she visited the state that ruined her chances there. Not only that, but in the last federal election she gave a piss-poor terrible sobbing interview with Tracey Grimshaw where she humiliated herself on national television but bursting into tears about how victimised she feels among other such pithy remarks. Now One Nation has 2 senators from its record of 4 and barely any elected members scattered throughout the country. And we've had her latest embarrassing political stunt, in which a right-wing strong-man (Pauline) is shown shrieking on the side of Uluru complaining that she's scared of slipping off. Instead of enticing voters, I think many of them will just be pissing their pants laughing that such an embarrassing person ever got elected into politics. While many other right-wingers easily recover from such stunts (think of Boris' flying-fox stunt in London), Pauline really can't think up anything on the spot, or indeed at all.",2.3

In the 2nd gorge we saw 2 ""freshies"" about 1m long as you can paddle so close to the shore. It is a bit tricky portaging the canoe but worth it. The rocks are so interesting and varied. You have tons of time to explore the 3 gorges on this day. If you do half day you only can do the first gorge which would be a bit disappointing. We also did the Butterfly Gorge and Lily Ponds walk.

Swimming safe top pools and bottom plunge pool. Nice shady picnic spots top and bottom. Toilet block at car park, for day trippers too.",4.0

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I arrived at this park early in the morning expecting to spend at most a couple of hours looking at some animals, then leaving as quickly as possible before the sun gets too hot. Instead, I ended up spending about 6 hours here. The reason is that there's lectures/talks throughout the day given by the park rangers. I have to confess that I had a lot of misconceptions about ""lifeless"" deserts. The talks are informative and showed just how much life and diversity there is in central Australia. The rangers are just amazing and really care about the environment we live in. Especially Doug and Matt who gave great talks about Indigenous life in the deserts, plans and kangaroos. Don't miss the nocturnal animals display, amazing watching the night animals scurrying about and their enclosures are a good size, so ""cages"" feels more humane.",4.0

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I totally get what you're saying, but scale maps sometimes do mix 'large and small' and different category objects in order to make a point. I feel like natural formations are hard enough to visualise in a way that does it justice, whereas buildings and monuments are things people spend a lot of time around, both up close and at distances where they can be seen standing against other structures small, medium, and large. The reason I was so wrong about my preconception of Uluru personally, is because photos taken of it have to be done wayyyy further in the distance than you expect or can even really tell given the perspective of the terrain. What makes the place special is not really that it's so huge in comparison to world natural formations, but just that it's so huge and imposing in the particular place and way that it is. Kinda like how the Giant's Causeway is not impressive just because it's a bunch of big rocks, but the specific conditions and natural beauty in the context of where the formations took shape, if you get my meaning.",3.1

When we arrived in Uluru after the drive we decided to climb the rock as it was going to be windy the next day.

You must be pretty fit to climb the rock, so much harder than it looks when the chain ends there is still a further way to go. We stayed at the Outback Pioneer Lodge, very basic and unclean.

We had a small window in the afternoon of a very hot day but saw enough to know we will be back on our next visit. Even though we missed the talks and activities the park offers we still had a wonderful time the Nocturnal House being the highlight.

We did the tour with an unofficial tour guide, Darrell, because it was much cheaper and were amazed to hear that the aboriginals built this over a 75 year period just like the pyramids. He said they painted it red so that they could see it better from a distance which make sense. Genius! There are still a handful of aborigines left in Australia and another thing that Darrell taught us is that they ride kangaroos. We learned so much!

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,In 2003 my year level went on a Central Australia trip and we finished it off at Uluru. Before hand we had a tour of the museum part and then the guide sat us all down and tried to discourage us from climbing it. She told us the significance of it to the Aborigine people and how it wasn’t fun having to go up there and collect the bodies of people who had been stupid and fallen and died (the climb itself is extremely narrow with steep cliffs either side and a single knee height chain fence that divides up from down.. no idea if this has been changed). About 5 people in the group didn’t climb and just walked around the base. The rest of us believed we had sat on a bus for the past week to get here and we were climbing the damn thing.

All around the outside of Uluru, you can find things like caves with carved maps and symbolism and meeting places, as well as important parts of Uluru representing the events of mythological stories. They also show you the local flora and fauna and how they were used by the Indigenous population. It is amazing how much cultural and historical information there is in this one big rock. I absolutely support preserving it. Plus, there are places to hike besides Uluru - Kata Tjuta is absolutely stunning, and that’s just the best one of many. I insist that we *have* a happy medium already; climbing Uluru is basically the only you *can’t* do and everything else you can do around the site and the region is great. Besides Uluru being equivalent to a church (I’m really oversimplifying for the sake of making my point), one of the other reasons the Indigenous don’t like people climbing on it is because people die on it.",4.6

The emus were moving around and here and there you could see them and take pictures. We arrived just in time for the kangaroos speech and that was really nice. The guide explained quite some details about these animals and there is actually no fence, so if you stay in the trail depends quite a lot were they are, but these animals move quite a lot when active, so we had plenty of opportunities. The space they have is quite big and it does not look like a zoo, this is really a park where the animals are at open air and they can move more or less freely.

Reddit/NatureIsFuckingLit,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Would it be disrespectfully to visit Uluru if you can get a permit or is it more or less welcomed to support the local economy? Edit: all these responses are making me really want to go! Thanks everyone!,2.9
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I honestly don't think being able to climb it would add that much. (And this is coming from a climber who loves to climb to the top of everything). When you are up there you can't really see the beauty of the rock itself and can only look into the flat surrounding of uluru. For me the most special was the drive into the national park approaching the rock. You are on this winding road and after every corner you see Uluru getting closer and closer. This huge perfect rock that seems completely out of place in this otherwise flat landscape. It was really cool imo. I understand the cost thing. Though if you have the time for a road trip and are willing to give up a bit of comfort and luxury it doesn't have to be all that expensive. There are still free camping options available nearby (look on wikicamps australia app). So you could do a roadtrip there and maybe combine with kata tjuta, king's canyon and macdonnel ranges and whatever interesting there is in between there and where you live while only paying for fuel and cheap food.",3.4
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Our flight was delayed by three hours, giving us time to study the land we hoped to visit and learn more about the Aboriginal culture, life, myths, and magic embodied in an ancient place called Uluru. The rock is considered the oldest, dating over 500 million years. As we made our first trip to view the sunset, we could see this monolithic masterpiece in the distance, undeniably the crowning masterpiece in our great land. The closer the view, (approximately 15-20 kilometres from the sunset viewing platform), the colour kept on changing rapidly. The height of the rock is 350 metres, the length is 2.8 kilometres with a perimeter of 10.5 kilometres, As we had our eyes glued on the massive structure, all I could say was, this is breathtakingly beautiful! A few aboriginal words of welcome! Palya! Welcome to the Anangu land-Pukulpa pitjam Ananguku ngurakutu!! Watching the sunset at Uluru is one of the most memorable events one will experience in a lifetime, as it takes it to a whole new level. The vastness of the desolate desert and the ever-changing rock texture offers an experience second to none. One will observe the rock changing from a dark brown, to a vibrant orange, and then a flaming red colour. Never has the morning been so rewarding! The temperature dipped to 3 degrees. We were awake before dawn and travelled to the cultural centre for information and a light breakfast. The The Uluru base walk commenced in basking sunshine whilst being attacked from all sides by flies. They are relentless in their approach, and the fly nets are the only defence. We decided on the Uluru base walk since it is the best way to fully appreciate the natural and cultural beauty of Uluru (10.8 kilometres) at 2:00 pm, and a brisk walk would return us to the start by 5:30 pm to view the Kata Tjuta sunset.",4.0

We did the Ghost Gum Loop which is a 1 hour loop. You climb to a lookout platform with a large Ghost Gum. The platform allows a view down onto the last part of the Gorge. From here you can go back the same way or follow the track as it meanders down the other side and comes out at the creek bed and back to the starting point along the creek bed. As they had recently had rain we did get our feet wet (deepest part was about 30 mm deep). There was a sign at the start that did warn about needing to wade cold water. There is also a 3 to 4 hour Pound Walk and those would definitely have gotten wet. We did not do this longer walk. There is a caf/shop at the start along with toilets, picnic area, etc Overall Great walk for medium fitness walkers but you may get wet feet depending on the recent rainfall.

Melbourne-Eyre Penninsula- Nullarbor- Kalgoorlie- Esperance - Margaret River - Bunbury - Perth - Pinnacles a Kalbarri - Denmark/Monkey Mia - Coral Bay - Ningaloo - Exmouth - Karajini NP - 80 mile - Broome - Cape Leveque - Derby - Horizontal Falls - Gibb River Road - Kununurra- Lake Argyle - Katherine - Litchfield NP - Darwin - Three Ways - Mt Isa - Winton - Longreach - Rockhampton- QLD central coast - Coffs Harbour - Sydney - Melbourne. This is just a high level list of locations we went to. Three months isn’t long enough in my opinion. You will undoubtedly spend more time in your car then actually enjoying the trip. That’s not to say the drive isn’t fun, it’s just you won’t actually spend time with the people, taking the time to see things and experience a location for what it is rather than what people tell you it is. Antique shops and golf courses weren’t even on our radar and we still didn’t see everything we wanted to. Also, doing it alone will be dangerous considering the distances you will travel. My wife and I shared the driving and did just on 30,000km in 6 months. Some 10 hour days. Perhaps consider half a lap. Adelaide - Flinders Ranges - Coober Pedy - Red Centre- Three Ways - Litchfield NP - Darwin and then choose which way - left in WA or right into QLD. I have friends currently doing exactly this. They’ve chosen WA as it is bloody mammoth and magnificent. And coming back through the middle. You might want to check out Facebook groups like Planning a Lap of Australia or The Gibb River Road, Kimberley and Pilbara region. As someone mentioned download WikiCamps. If you plan on camping in national parks get a parks pass for WA. You need to book 180 days out to get into some camp grounds in WA. There is literally nothing like the Ningaloo coast anywhere else in the world. You need to take your time here. Bring a snorkel. This country is massive mate. I’ve done some big drives in the USA. Nevada and Utah in a big loop including the north rim and through four ways and all the amazing national parks. Also Seattle down to San Fran. It’s nothing like that.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I had two weeks travelling in Australia - I had to start in Brisbane and finish in Sydney, and with my extra four days, I booked a flight from Sydney to Ayers Rock airport (AUD450 return with Jetstar if you book early enough). Is it worth flying to a desert the middle of nowhere to see a bunch of rocks? Yes - the scenery is otherworldly and there's a surprising amount to do. And although it's hard to do Uluru cheap, it is possible to do it cheaper. The Ayers Rock resort is small with about four hotels, one supermarket, a few eateries, and a free bus that cycles the resort every 15 minutes. I stayed at the Outback Pioneer Lodge and cooked for myself when possible. Buses to and from the resort are synchronised with the few flights. Buy a face net from the supermarket to protect from bush flies (they don't bite, they're just very annoying). And bring warm clothes for morning activities - it's colder than you might think! Activities can be booked through multiple agencies but all run by the same operators. Plan carefully and nap if you can - you'll be waking up very early a lot! Here are reviews of the activities I did:- AAT Kings - Sunrise tour and Kata Tjuta Walpa Gorge - Sunrise was good but if you are pressed for time, prioritise the sunset tour over it (or go with Uluru Express as mentioned later). Walpa Gorge was very pretty but knowing what I know now I would have probably have done Valley of the Winds. AAT Kings - Sunset tour, base highlights and cultural centre - You're given a guided tour of some of the highlights of Uluru's base, including a cave with Aboriginal paintings, a water hole and several sites of cultural importance. The cultural centre was rather short but I bought a painted boomerang! And sunset was great - a snack buffet, a chance to meet the Anangu people and yes, the rock does seem to glow red! AAT Kings - King's Canyon tour - A long journey but worth it (and probably the better way to do it - the King's Canyon resort centre is even more remote and tiny than the Ayers rock resort). The canyon gives a lot of dramatic views, varied scenery and amazing photo opportunities. We also stopped at a cafe/farm for breakfast and a bar on the way home. Uluru Express - sunrise and base walk/climb - Not a tour, just transportation. But if you're set on doing the sunrise tour, then this may be a better way to do it. The main reason I did this was because I wanted to get to Uluru early to do either the self-guided base walk or climb before flying out. I didn't do the base walk, but it was a backup plan if the climb was not open. It takes about 3-4 hours to walk the base of Uluru. The climb is a controversial option. It is only open if the weather is good (and it was closed for at least two of my days there). The initial climb is short but VERY steep (there is a chain in the rock) and people have died here from heart attacks. Also, the Anangu consider Uluru to be sacred and ask that tourists do not climb it - there have been plans to close it for many years. I was torn as to whether to do it, but I decided not to miss the opportunity and climbed - the views from the top are utterly incredible - I may never see so much blue sky again in my life. But decide for yourself whether you think it's right to do so. Overall I'm very glad I went to Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. It's heavy on the wallet but equally so on the experiences and memories.",3.6

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"If you are heading to Kakadu, Gunlom Falls is a must do. We also recommend 100% taking a 4x4. There are 2wd tracks aswell but it really limits what you can see especially when paying to enter the park you want to maximise your stay. A guide told us we couls take our van to Gunlom Falls as its 2wd accessible but it was the most awful horrible drive and causes suspension damage so definitely go 4x4. However once we made it to the falls it was so magical. It's a very steep hike up so be prepared. Take water and sturdy shoes and a hat. The reward is an infinity pool overlooking the Kakadu national park and it's very beautiful.",3.6

Reddit/civ,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ok, so... I'm torn on this, in the same way I'm torn about any sort of eco-tourism. On the one hand, I have a great respect for indigenous cultures, and think the shit-show they get from colonizers really does suck, even to this day. And there does need to be some form of natural conservation to ensure ecosystems can continue to function. But I don't think either of those should extend to blocking people off from experiencing the majesty and beauty of places like Uluru or Bear's Lodge/Devil's Tower, or any other natural wonder. In this case, I think the Anangu are in the wrong about Uluru. People *should* be allowed to climb, and the Anangu should instead welcome people to make the climb and even consider instructing tourists on their cultural practices within Uluru. Denying access to anyone is wrong, regardless of the reason. There *has* to be a happy medium.",2.5
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Visited Ayers Rock 40 years ago but it was still an awe-inspiring sight when you first see it again. We were lucky enough to be sitting on the left side of the plane as we flew into Ayers Rock airport and see Ayers Rock and the Olgas from the air. Then driving towards the Rock just blows you away with its hugeness. There is a $25 per person pass for 3 days of unlimited entry into the park, payable when you first drive in. There are plenty of signs and information around Ayers Rock to give you some background to the area. The sunrises and sunsets are a definite must as well - it must be one of the country's most photographed natural features !! We did the base walk which is a fantastic 3-4 hour level walk and gives a great perspective to the size and majesty of the iconic rock. February is the peak of summer heat here but starting the walk at 7am gave us ample time to stroll around the base and return before the heat of the day took over. The rock climb is closed from 8am throughout summer and it was also closed earlier than that time the day we were there due to high winds. We actually enjoyed being here in summer as the tourist crowds were presumably less than in peak season, and the weather was very manageable (we were camping). Flies didn't bother us too much either, but we did notice that most foreign tourists were wearing fly nets. Ayers Rock is a must see at least once in your lifetime. Shame that so many Aussies travel all around the world but neglect to see their own country and the amazing sights it has on offer.",4.3

They're not even issuing a full ban of tourists to Uluru, they're literally just saying you can't climb on it anymore. There's been a history of incidents and stupidity that have influenced them to make the decision. >Why do you believe the religion of the Anangu is somehow more deserving of respect over Christianity? Or Islam? Or Buddhism? It's not a organized religion we're talking about here, it's a spiritual aspect of their cultural traditions. There is a massive distinction between religion and spirituality. >Or is the cultural religious practice of marriage not as worthy as the worship of a big rock because it doesn't affect you as much?

You’re correct that it’s an enormous rock, but I wouldn’t say it’s wrong to call it a small mountain either. Fun fact to anyone that cares: Uluru is “the tip of the iceberg” - it continues down into the Earth for up to 6km (Uluru is about 343m above the ground).",3.6

The campground is small but well maintained with hot showers and gas bbqs. There's also a small kiosk open during the day, and they have pizza nights on Wednesdays and Saturdays (I think).

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We visited twice in the same day, early in the morning before it got too hot (recommended) and for the nocturnal tour. The day tour is on well laid out paths, unescorted, and can be done at your own pace. Beautifully presented and the information on signs is helpful and entirely adequate. Will take about 1 1/2 - 2 hours to take it all in. The evening tour was very special. Two guides and red filters on their powerful lights ensure the animals are not disturbed and will go on doing whatever (eating probably) despite the presence of visitors. Our group was very small - only six people, including the two guides. It gives an entirely different feel vs. the day visit. Many different animals were seen, mostly small marsupials and, most notably, the echidnas. Not shy, waddled right up to us, inspected the shoes of the ladies - decided they were not interesting and moved back into the scrub. If you are interested in the Outback and its animal life, this is a must do. And a really excellent gift shop to boot. Highly recommended.",4.6

Did the base walk of 10km, as experienced hikers enjoyed the easy walk but did not like the segways, bike groups and camel rides. These with the constant helicopters confirm that besides the climb the whole experience is just commercial. Add prices at the nearby resort town and money is everything. Not sure what impact closing the climb will have commercially because money is the current priority regardless of what is said.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I love this place. When people come to Alice, this is always the place I recommend as a 'must do' - particularly at the start of an Alice adventure. I am a new local and it was my first port of call when I moved here. Best introduction to the landscape ever. Make sure you have a good few hours to explore - either by yourself or preferentially f with one of rangers. The rangers are a wealth of knowldge and are more than happy to share a few local secrets with you. You can get up close an personal with dingos and, of course everyone's favourite, kangaroos. The nocturnal house is world class. The bird show is highly recommended - and look out for the surprise ending in the movie, it's sure to blow your mind! It's a great place for the young and young at heart alike! Seriously, if you are in Alice you gotta check this place out!",4.8
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Drive in was a 37km gravel road with some corrugation that improved after the first few km’s. We arrived at 9am before the crowds but met a lot of traffic when we left at midday. The walk up to the upper pools was an easy 650 metres but with a lot of steps. Well formed path with railings. The swim and the view was absolutely worth the drive. There is a campground and ammenities at Gunlom.,4.0
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,2 - 3 nights is all u [need.As](http://need.As) others say fly direct to Uluru and stay at the resort. There are a number of price options. Uluru is great but Kata Tjuta is probably my favourite of the two... esp for walking. We rented a car at Uluru airport - but you must book ahead. Really popular and even with a rental booking there can be long queues,4.1
TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Yes the drive on the dirt road on the way was bumpy but there were cars doing it no problems. Once you are there it is amazing. The pool at the bottom was beautiful but the rockpools at the top were heaven. The walk up was steep but you are rewarded when you get to the top. The pools are crystal clear, not too deep or cold.

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Like so much of the NT, Gunlom falls is not easy to get to without a 4WD. But the effort it takes to get there makes it all the better. There is a large pool at the bottom of the waterfall, although we were warned by a local guide that there is a freshwater croc that has made that pool it's home. Freshies are (supposedly) harmless, but I wouldn't like to see one when I'm swimming. We were also warned that every year they set traps for salties and usually have to relocate 1 or 2 every year from close to the waterfall. That said, there were plenty people (myself included) that took a dip in the bottom pool to cool off. The climb to the top of the waterfall is HARD. It is very steep, with no clearly marked path at times. You'll need a decent level of fitness and good shoes to do this climb. Once you get to the top there are a series of connected pools that lead to the top of the waterfall. Absolutely spectacular. Swimming in the pools at the top made the climb totally worth it. Highly recommended.",4.2

The Gorge tours are owned and operated by the local Jaywon people, the guides are experienced and passionate. The two gorge cruise tour is a MUST see as a minimum. You will see much natural beauty, hear stories of the dreamtime, the traditional beliefs of how yhe 13 gorges were formed etc. there are also many walking tracks and lookouts. It is free to enter the park itself however if overnughting or taking tours there is a fee... Quite reasonably priced. There are also helicopter flights on offer, they range in cost from $100 for 10 mins or much more for personal charters. Definately well worth a visit.

It was free entry to all but even at the normal price this is a great value, great fun day out. The staff are always friendly. The large enclosures for the range animals including dingos, emus and kangaroos allow easy, close up viewing. The animals are relaxed and clearly happy. The high points are the bird enclosures where us humans can enter, here the longer one spends the more one sees. The nocturnal house offers a chance to see the desert animals that it is near impossible to see in the wild: billies, bandicoots, hopping mice, malars and many more. Because it is Alice Springs there is never a crowd, even on the open day, kids can go right up to the glass and run along with the animals just inside. A super venue and a super day.",4.6
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Uluru really is a place most Australians would love to visit and it is worth going. The rock really is amazing, changing with every movement of the sun and the clouds. It is a pity the road is not open at night for astrophotography. On sunrise, the sunrise platform is somewhat annoying and doesn't really give you the best possible sunrise view of Uluru, though Kata-Tjuta glows red in the background. We did a base walk around the rock and would recommend doing this in the morning when there is more shadow around the base. It was a great walk - just a little uncomfortable in full noon sun and I would only do it in the early morning if the temperature was high.",3.7

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We didn't book on a guided tour just booked the bus pick up and drop off from our hotel Sails In The Desert which went smoothly. It took as two and a half hours to walk around the very scenic walk around the base of the rock. Hot, thirsty work but well worth it for great photos. Take enough water! There are some notices around a few points of the walk requesting that you refrain from taking photos and you should respect that request as there are plenty of photo opportunities to be had. At the main car park there is a chain up the steep face of the rock where we did see people climbing. However, it looks to be very hazardous and I understand that several people have died after falling on this steep climb. There are some plaques on the rock indicating as much. People can make their own decisions on what they do but make sure it is an informed one!!!",3.9
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Ok...I finally got to see the Big Rock bka Ayers Rock AKA ULURU! Its ginormous and red and did I say ginormous?! The Aboriginal history and stories given by our guide was interesting but I sometimes wonder if a full day is necessary here? Is there a big hype for $ or is it really worth the hype? For me...it is definitely a place to visit, take in a little history and maybe even meditate. There is an energy about this place that silently whispers....history, peace, sacred grounds. I took a hundred pictures and you know what...they all look the same! And this was from different angles. So I quietly wondered if my visit was even worth it. Yes, but now that I've gone I personally don't ever have to go back. It's a huge rock in the middle of the Outback for goodness sakes! It's a Unesco World Heritage Site people!!! You MUST go see it if you happen to be in the Outback!! Also if you go...use SEIT Tours and ask for Emilee or Lachland! They are THE BEST GUIDES EVER!",2.9
Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"You must visit Uluru. Seriously the more you study it the more amazing the place is. Uluṟu , Mt Conner & The Olga’s all line up within 1 degree of each other. All roughly the same mass ( The Olga’s) are split into 27 individual rocks. The popular opinion is that they were volcanic & raised from below however extended periods of study & a little common sense will tell you they came from above . Mt Conner viewed from around 50 klm above, will display this the easiest to understand. Also the popular opinion from “The Experts” is that the caves at the base of Uluṟu was caused from millions of years of water erosion as there was a inland sea at some stage backed up by fish fossils being found. However, if you follow the thought bubble of water erosion, you also have to believe that the water erosion was very disciplined as the Caves are so evenly spaced apart & of pretty much the same size. Also inside the caves, on the ceiling there are formations which the Experts say was caused by millions of years of water dripping down & calcification. However when I first saw them I immediately recognised them as a backbone. I guess 50 years ago some Expert came up with the water calcification thing and it stuck. Anyway I was out there for months Studying it up close & that was my take away. It is worth a visit, have a look & form your own thoughts. It’s around a 3-4 hour drive from Alice Springs but we’ll worth the Visit. Do it wary on in your time in Alice otherwise it will be one of those things you never do. My only advise is just don’t overthink things out there otherwise it’ll do your head in.",4.1

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"There is something special about Uluru, the huge piece of monolithic rock in the middle of Australia’s red centre. It’s easily recognised through the thousands of post cards and calendars that flood the souvenir shops and from a distance that’s what it looked like – a post card photograph. Close up however it’s a different story. It is towering, brilliant and iron red and somehow peaceful and menacing at the same time. The first thing you realise about Uluru is the fact that the rock is miles from anywhere – a six hour bus ride from Alice Springs or a very expensive plane flight. There were day trips to the rock and back, but the thought a 12 hour return journey was too much. We opted for a two day trip with an overnight at Uluru. That way we would get to see a sunset and a sunrise. But we hit a snag just before we left. Most of the trips leave the Alice on Monday and Wednesday at 6.30 in the morning. We had booked our onward flight to Darwin on Virgin and the once a week flight left Thursday morning. We booked that rather than the trip on Qantas which cost twice as much on the other days. We arrived in Alice Springs on Monday at lunchtime, so that was too late and the Wednesday trip arrived back after our flight left. It took a lot of chasing but finally we found a Tuesday trip by AAT Kings through Metro Travel: Australis Inbound Tours & Travel. The snag here was they had no accommodation left. Rooms in Yulara village at Uluru are scarce and very expensive. We did manage to find a place – a sparse bunk bed room with shower at the Outback Pioneer Lodge for $265 for the night. It was the last room in town! So at 6.25 am, bleary-eyed, we left the Chifley Hotel and climbed on board the coach. It was a comfortable coach, with plenty of room for legs and hand-luggage and onboard toilet. Thanks to an informative and amusing driver and a couple of stops along the way those six hours passed pretty quickly. Breakfast was at the Camel Farm. There was not a lot to see, but the short camel rides were popular – my wife took one, but I resisted the temptation. The next stop for a morning tea break was more interesting. It was at the Mount Ebenezer Roadhouse and Art Gallery, an historic staging post with plenty to look at around the walls. The art gallery too was great with many fine aboriginal paintings and artefacts at very reasonable prices. In fact if you intend to buy paintings or souvenirs on a similar trip, I would recommend buying them at Mt Ebenezer as similar items are much more expensive at Uluru. We arrived around 1 pm at The Outback Pioneer complex, grabbed a spot of lunch in the fascinating Yulara Square before being picked up by the coach for the drive to Uluru itself. This was an amazing trip. The red centre was green. Recent downpours had transformed the arid landscape into a garden of plants and shrubs that were vivid with masses of bright flowers. It was a rare and stunning landscape. We soon saw Uluru, the picture postcard distance shot. Close up it was magnificent; the colour nothing you could imagine and the weather-hewn contours so smooth and unearthly. It’s no wonder it is a sacred site for Aborigines. The coach took us all the way round the base of the rock and, after a short and easy walk to the beautiful Mutitjulu Waterhole it was on to view Aboriginal rock paintings. The driver was on hand to talk about Aboriginal and European history of Uluru and learn about native flora. It was a tour that taught me a lot about the first Australians and a not so primitive culture. They knew about the dangers of radiation from uranium long before we did. There was more info and art at the Kata Tjuta Cultural Centre. Then we set off in the twilight for the Uluru sunset viewing area. Now this was terrific as we stood drinking champagne and nibbling on canapés watching the sunset rays settled on the rock and we saw the legendary colour changes as darkness slowly settled in. It was an experience not to be missed. There was a bush barbecue as an added extra, but we passed it up and ate at the hotel so we could have an early night and get ready for the sunrise the next morning with a 5 am start. It was cold and we shivered as the saw the first rays of the sun hit the rock. But it was nowhere near as impressive as the sunset and I was glad to back onto the bus for the journey to mystical domes of Kata Tjuta. Again these amazing formations were a joy to see and then we stopped at the base of Walpa Gorge. The trail follows the natural creek between two of the tallest domes of Kata Tjuta. I found it hard going over broken pebbles and a steep incline. But it was an impressive sight. By around 10.45 we were back at the Pioneer Lodge and within minutes the room cleaners were there to tell us checkout was 10 am and roust us out of the room! With threats of being charged an extra night we hustled around and checked out. Then, with our coach for Alice Springs due at 1 pm we found we couldn’t even get a beer because we were no longer hotels guests. Talk about catch 22. But e coach arrived on time and we were on our way back to Alice Springs, tired but filled with memories of a fascinating and informative trip. The cost was $650 per person, which I thought was excellent value. 1300 664 883 is the number for Metro Travel: Australis Inbound Tours & Travel. .",3.5

Reddit/todayilearned,Alice Springs Desert Park,"> I can’t imagine doing that trip to get to or from Alice Springs and not being able to stop to get supplies. There are strategically placed road houses for fuel and supplies along the major highways, which are all paved, and the roads are usually pretty busy so you can flag down help if you need it. You'll want to make sure you have a least a few hours of fuel at all times though. On the not so travelled highways you can certainly get into trouble. > It’s hard for me to imagine being in a civilized country but that far from civilization. I think most foreign persons mistake the size and remoteness of most of Australia. Head a hour out of a major city and you might not even have any mobile coverage. And vice-versa for us. I was playing some Microsoft Flight Sim in a busy area in the US, and all I could see horizon to horizon was cities merging into other cities. There is *nothing* comparable to that in Australia.

I cant comment on Venezuela at all but in my experience assault and rape rates between Joburg and Alice are pretty similar (I know a lot of people who have worked in both places and I’ve worked in Alice). If you haven’t been to Alice Springs/Tennant Creek/etc, its NOTHING like anywhere else in Australia, it might as well be another planet (particularly at night, the day is often fine unless a particular event has set off rioting).

He talked about the vegetation, wild life, bush food, where to find water and the local Arrente people. We went into the nocturnal house, a beautifully set up museum of wild life, and then we watched a presentation of live birds! Well worth a visit when you get to Alice Springs.",4.6
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,We were travelling as part of a Distant Journeys Tour of Australia and stayed 1 night. The standard of the room wast excellent and the breakfast choice was the best of the tour by far; taking into consideration the remote location this was a great achievement.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"If you like birds you will love this place, heaps of avaries everywhere. Not many other large animals, couple of kangaroos sitting around and a couple of dingoes and emus. The nocturnal house is great, probably about the best thing in the park, heaps of snakes and lizards and small nocturnal animals in different glass enclosures. You can see these same animals at the reptile centre in town. You could spend a few hours here walking around, or longer if you go to the talks, which are on every hour or so in different parts of the park. The bird show is quite good, especially the eagle and the owls. There's a short film at the entrance that is interesting if you have the time and a gift shop when you come out. The park is a fair way out of town, which is logical, but if you're not driving it will cost you a lot to get there. Too far to walk, bus doesn't go out that far and taxi is very expensive. We booked a tour bus through Alice Wanderer which picks people up from their apartments and drops you off at the park then picks you back up again later. This was quite expensive and only have certain pick up and drop off times. That said there was only 1 other couple on the bus with us so didn't have to drive around picking people up all morning and on return we were the only ones on the bus so got dropped off where we wanted to go. They also organised entry fees. I think it costs $25 per person to get in which is a bit steep. Probably wouldn't go back here, once was enough to see everything.",3.2

TripAdvisor,Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge / Nitmiluk National Park),"Enjoyed an overnight visit to the Nitmiluk National Park. The facilities/accommodation are great; the willingness/capacity of staff to help very limited. Example 1: Checking into accommodation, the chalets at the park - this was first time in my life have I been told that I couldn't check in (20 minutes after 2pm check in time) for another 10 minutes 'because the paperwork was not ready'. Service definitely got off to a mediocre start. Example 2: When enquiring about hikes, we were there were no maps available as all walks were 'well signposted'. On pressing the staff member, we were finally given a map which covered only the first/shortest loop - to Baruwei Lookout + Loop walk. A dotted line on our printed map denoted as 'start Southern Walks'. Based on a signpost that denoted distance, we decided to extend our loop walk to go to Pat's lookout. Although light was fading, we reasoned we had enough time as we knew the distance. Upon arrival at Pat's Lookout, whilst we considered walking to Jedda's rock, we decided against it as the distance was NOT signposted. As it seems, all walks were not well signposted - we would have thought having a park map available of all the walks for visitors a basic safety requirement. Example 3: We had planned on canoeing the gorge for a full day, but when booking on arrival (for the following day) we were told we could only do a half day as full day hires were 'full' - this meant we were limited to canoe the first gorge only. We were told that full day numbers were limited to 10 groups (as opposed to 35 groups for half day), with no explanation as to why. It became evident whilst canoeing the following day - that canoes were 'parked' in the second gorge for those were privileged to be in the 10 who got in first 'full day' canoe hire. Some explanation would have been helpful. Staff were pleasant, but appeared ill-equipped with knowledge of the park, and some with a 'take it or leave it' attitude. A shame really, as this is a truly spectacular part of the world.",3.3

Reddit/megalophobia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"We don’t disagree. It is inherently racist for colonizers to decide who is and isn’t indigenous. We know who is and isn’t indigenous because they were there before we showed up. The forced breeding of indigenous populations by colonizers through rape makes “muddies the waters”, but the bottom line is that you know you aren’t indigenous. So don’t try to climb Uluru. What you’re describing is common in the US. It’s called the blood quantum. It amounts to textual genocide, because in a world where indigenous people are being actively pushed into extinction through loss of territory and forced interbreeding and kids doing everything they can to leave the rez because it’s a fucking nightmare eventually nobody will have that magical 1/8 blood quantum and there will no longer legally be indigenous people. It’s hard to tell if your comment was in good faith or not, but self identification is an eminently valid means of determining who has access to the monolith that was forcibly taken from the local indigenous population. If you’re not indigenous and claim to be, there’s no trial. You’re a shitty human being. Maybe someone picks up on that and beats the shit out of you. You’re a thief, and you come from thieves, and so goes the entire history of colonization. It wouldn’t be unique. It’s unfortunate and we would hope people try not to be monsters. Your comment seemed to miss the point of the piece. That indigenous people ARE catalogued according to western conceptions of indigenousness which are wholly ignorant of tribal lines and cultural existence is bad.

This includes stopping walks from 8am on mornings where it it is predicted to be over 36 degrees.

Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Firstly, Australian Aborigines were not a single homogeneous culture. And its not true that they were stagnant for 50,000 years (nor that the only thing they invented was the ~~stick~~ boomerang). Nevertheless, I believe your conclusion is broadly correct. On the one hand we have an egalitarian point of view that says that Uluru is a symbol for **all** Australians, regardless of race, colour, sex, religion or creed, that we all have equal claim on the spirituality of the red centre and an equal right to climb the monolith and commune with the land; that even non-Australians are welcome to come and partake of this. And on the other hand we have a deeply racist and sexist point of view that says, no, it is only sacred for one tiny minority (the Anangu) out of a tiny minority of Australians; that people's access to Uluru depends on their race and sex (there are parts which are traditionally forbidden to men, and parts traditionally forbidden to women: the national park asks people not to take photos of those sections lest they are seen by the wrong sex); that only the Anangu can have a spiritual connection to the land there. We shouldn't dismiss a culture because it is old. We should dismiss it because it is elitist, racist and sexist. Yes, yes, I know that's the pot calling the kettle black. But at least we're *trying* to be less sexist and racist, not putting discrimination up on a pedestal and saying ""we've always done it this way"".

Most of the additional time is spent swimming. As it was 39oC the swim was great and refreshing, in such an amazing location. However if you don’t want to swim I wouldn’t recommend this tour. Some of our tour group didn’t want to swim, or didn’t know a swim was included so didn’t have their bathers! They said it was a bit boring sitting watching others swim for over an hour.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"So much is written about Uluru, and so many photos taken.... so instead I thought to focus on the big discussion point with my family of teenage kids - whether or not to climb Uluru. The argument will be moot after October 2019 when the rock is closed off. But that, combined with a reluctance by the current custodians and National Parks to open up the climb (it was open for only 3 hours in the 3 days we were there), means there is a huge pent up demand to climb. When it does open, it's chaos. I was more dubious about the arguments against climbing Uluru until I visited the Cultural Centre and also walked around the rock. I came to appreciate the significance of Uluru to the local indigenous people, including the role Uluru has had in preserving and protecting their people. Dreamtime stories, used to covey key values and beliefs, are told using the features of Uluru. I came to the conclusion that climbing Uluru was equivalent to abseiling down St Paul Cathedral in Melbourne, so decided it was not for me. Hearing of a poor +70 year old tourist dieing from a heart attack climbing Uluru earlier in the week also helped focus my thinking. In the end, all 4 of my teenage kids climbed Uluru, while my wife and I waiting nervously at the bottom (not all 37 climbing deaths are heart attacks, many are also falls, including at least one child). Our kids described the ascent as ""hard work"", view at the top as ""spectacular"", and the descent as ""terrifying"". They also described the chaos around the guide chains, the log jams at the steepest inclines, and the spectacle of parents literally dragging young children up the rock, tethered and screaming.

In this context, a lot of Indigenous youth, especially in places like Alice Springs, have been impacted by suicide of family members or friends. Imagine the impact that has on a developing mind. The Uluru Statement from the Heart goes into great detail about the pervasive issues impacting First Nations communities and made strong recommendations supported by hundreds of Indigenous Elders from across Australia.

Reddit/OldPhotosInRealLife,Alice Springs Desert Park,"c Jan 1941. An Australian soldier looks over Alice Springs, Central Australia The Japanese were identified as a threat to Australia in 1920 but it wasn’t until 1940 that this translated to men on the ground here. From Alice Springs and up ‘the track’ to Darwin they worked to improve the roads and infrastructure for defense. By Feb 1942 the bombs started raining down on Darwin, and Alice became a staging post for men and equipment heading North. The railway from the South and East coast stopped in the Centre of Australia and hundreds of trucks dragged freight and men the other thousand miles to the North coast. At the peak of the war 5 trains per day were unloaded. The initial 700 men and 150 trucks in the Transport mob (Darwin Overland Maintenance Force) were soon doubled and re-organised as the ‘Central Australian Motor Transport Column’ With Mount Gillen in the distance, I did not have to scramble around the hills too long to find the location for this picture, all you need is a boulder with a vertical face, looking to the Southwest. However, to frame the shot accurately I had to come back a few times. photo from the War memorial https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C26962 There were up to about a dozen camps for enlisted men and those employed by the government’s Allied Works Council. Alice population was about 600 before the war and suddenly they needed power water and food for 5000 men. At the bottom of this hill to the left, just out of sight was the Royal Engineers’ camp. There was a machine gun post in the rocks on this hill 60 metres behind the camera. A shitty old 1914-1918 Lewis machine gun as anti-aircraft defense was a rather bitter reminder that Australia was far behind in the race to fit out and equip her fighting men.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Having just returned from a bush camping trip we had seen lots of desert places so I wasn't sure that a desert park would offer much more. Once there, any doubts were gone, as this place has a fantastic range of wildlife. The park is nice and large with easy walking access everywhere. you get an audio guide and a reference map so you know what you are looking at as you go around the paths. There is a good gift shop too. The nocturnal house is great - we saw bilby, marla, quokka, hopping mice and more. The bird display is really great, especially the raptors that will fly right over you (handy tip: don't sit under the frogmouth owl). There are also several aviaries where you can see lots of the impressive Australian birds. Also the park has free ranging birds so expect to see some lovely ones (the splendid fairy wren was my favourite). We sat down for a break and watched a lace monitor digging for bugs and then taking a bath. We had no car so went for the pick up and return from the hotel. We arrived just after 9am and were just getting our bearings when a worker put up a notice saying ""The cafe is closed today, sorry for any inconvenience"". This left us with a choice of cutting our visit short to return for lunch in town (which at $48 a ticket would have made the park quite expensive) or tough it out and spend the whole day there anyway. We decided to stay and got the 4:15 bus back, and this let us see everything. You need a whole day to see it properly as animals don't always appear 'on cue'. This is why I have rated the park down from excellent. It really isn't acceptable to have tourists miles from anywhere with no transport and inform them that the cafe is closed once they arrive. When I mentioned it to the bus driver on the way back she said 'yeah, they have been having a few problems with the cafe', so it wasn't something that just popped up that day. The staff just seemed to have an 'oh well' attitude about the problem. I reckon they should have taken our lunch orders and sent someone into town to get some sandwiches. I hate to harp on about this, as overall this park is excellent so the cafe problem was quite unexpected.",4.1

Have lunch here, but note they do stop serving at 2.30pm. After that preprepared sandwiches are available. Second, there are excellent free Mala Walks with park rangers at 10am in Winter or 8am in Summer. The walk is not too strenuous and pretty flat, and you will get a decent basic understanding of the significance of Uluru. Our ranger was excellent.

Plus there is so much to do and see in central Aus beyond Uluru. When people visit, it’s typically either fly in and fly out of Uluru airport, or it’s a massive road trip to and from Central Aus. As far back as at least 2003 its been strongly discouraged. There was signage everywhere saying it’s disrespectful, so we didn’t climb it. Only going off what I saw and read and experienced when I visited. Also for most of the Covid period, residents from NT, WA, SA, TAS and QLD have still be able to visit. It’s mostly just NSW and VIC (and possibly ACT?) who haven’t, yes they make up a large chunk of the population but the people in the remaining states can’t travel internationally so my hope is they still had at least some domestic tourists. It is bloody expensive to travel domestically though… I’d say that’s a bigger deterrent for local visitors than not being able to climb it.",2.5

It also has beautiful views, with the ranges in the back, and you forget that you are not really in the outdoors, but I'm a park. The implementation of the walks is very good, it has shade stations to rest in every track, with drinking water, guided tours, or if you prefer to go by your own, a recording for interpretation of the path. The guides are well informed and nice, and they do amazing activities: from aboriginal culture related, to animal related. NOT TO MISS: the bird show!! Really amazing. When you leave the park you really leave with a better understanding of desert ecosystems, geology of Australia's deserts and Aboriginal significance of the land, besides having a good relaxing time in a gorgeous place.

There had also been some rain that created beautiful slender waterfalls, and I took some great photos that I have framed now. Getting to the Red Center is a bit of a trek, and I met plenty of Aussies during my backpacking around Australia that said they never had seen the rock. In my opinion, it was one of the highlights of my trip to Australia, and worth the extra effort and expense to make it there. The purported color changes were subtle from my perspective, but I feel like I got to see something that I had only ever read about in passing.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A small group of us (3 women) visited for 3 days/2 nights on a self guided tour. Uluru has been high on my list to visit and it didn't disappoint. We rented a car, stayed at the Sails in the Desert and enjoyed the free activities. It's in a self contained resort with restaurants, cafes, grocery store, souvenir shop, post office and visitor center. The trip's highlights was sunrise and sunsets at Ayers Rock and Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) formation. A national park pass is $25/adult and good for 3 days. Ayers Rock has bigger crowds. Kata Tjuta is a longer drive from the resort but equally beautiful. Start early to stake a good spot at the viewing car parks, especially for sunsets. The visitor center in the park provides a good history of the indigenous culture and Anangu people. We also spent one night on the Field of Lights with high expectations. It was somewhat disappointing as many of the lights were broken and there were some loud (drunk?) people wandering around. If you don't like flies, get a head net from the IGA market.

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"I was most looking forward to visiting Gunlom falls and the plunge pool probably mores than anything else while we were going to be in Kakadu. We set out early from our hotel at Cooinda Lodge (around 8:45am) and arrived at the parking area of the falls by 10:15am. You do NOT need a 4WD - AWD vehicle is fine. More on that later. This turned out to be perfect, because as we were driving in on the dirt road there was a mass exodus of camper vans. They had had their sunrise and morning swim and everyone was vacating when we arrived at 10:15. Most people go straight to the base of the falls, but we made it straight for the top. It took maybe 20 minutes to get to the top. It was actually quite easy. They have built stairs and amazing paths so in a few months those will be finished and it even easier to get to the top of the falls. Only a little bit of rock scrambling when we were there. We had the plunge pool to ourselves because a family thought it was too cool to swim and they went to the upper pools. We easily swam for about 50 minutes with hardly anyone else there. Then it started getting busy (a lot of people came without swimmers) but they just looked at the place from the side of the water. We went to the upper pools at this time and surprise - no one there! We plopped down for a nice swim and then had lunch. It was so wonderful. Now, let's talk about the drive in. We were there on June 1, and the road had been recently grated and we thought it was very manageable for our all wheel drive subaru. The road was wide at some points, skinny at others, and whenever there was a rock or big divit in the road they had a sign warning you. There was some bumpy washboard effect on the road - but I get that all the time in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia, USA. the roads here were better. What really damages the road are the locals who speed like crazy down the road. You get the sense they had these ridiculous trucks with snorkels and they were just showing off trying to use their off road vehicles for a change. Please do yourself a favor, and others, and slow down when someone passes in the opposite direction. It's very unsafe when the locals would fly by, kick up dust, and then you could not see at all for a few seconds. Just go slow, and you'll do fine on this road. I did notice that they removed the signs on the road which said 4WD recommended, as an all wheel drive vehicle (all wheel drive means all 4 wheels are engaged) can navigate it just fine. We even saw some 2WD cars make the journey - though I'm not sure I would have felt comfortable due to the crazy locals who speed and tear up the road.",3.3

We had the top of the falls and the inifinity pool to ourselves for sunset overlooking the breathtaking birds eye view of Kakadu National Park. We just made it back down as it got dark, so take a torch if you go at sunset! Next morning we three went back to the top - mum had a bad knee so we took the climb slowly (it is a rocky and steep trail) and after about an hour we were at the top. Busier this time of day (about 11am) with tourists, but still amazing and great to see the view again by day. Lots of little parts of the creek to swim in and falls to dip your head under. Worth a couple of hours at the top so take water and snacks. Around lunchtime as we left it was getting quite crowded so I'd suggest the sunset and morning treks up the top are the way to go!

We were transported with the range of beautiful birds that we saw, and they all exist in close proximity to Alice Springs, i.e. no ring-ins! Give yourself plenty of time, it's well worth it.",3.2

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The park has many wonderful different features from experiencing feeding of wild birds of prey to observing nocturnal small animals in their natural habitat in the special enclosure. The park is well signposted and documented and they have mororized 'gophurs' available for hire for those who are unable to walk easily, motorised carts for the disabled and wheelchairs available. The paths are well laid out and easy to walk with many of the unique Australian animals such as wallabies, kangaroos and emus in enclosures and very visible. The wildflowers are a treat to see as are the native parrots, cockatoos and other birds like lovely little zebra finches. Rangers who are extremely knowledgable about the flora, fauna and their habitat, ecology etc are available and a film show which is amazing is shown in the theatre and is not to be missed. A cafeteria is on site for food and drink purchase. The best time to visit is probably during the spring, winter and autumn as it gets very hot in Alice Springs and in mid summer temperatures can reach 40 deg plus celcius. Commonly in summer the temperatures will reach between 30 and 36 deg celcius so if you visit during the summer months (Dec through Feb) remember to carry and drink lots of water (you will dehydrate very quickly in these temperatures) wear a hat and sunglasses and don't forget to slap on the sunscreen. The colours of the ranges that rise alongside the park are supurb in early morning and evening and the blue of the sky has to be seen to be believed.",4.6

The park is lovely with nice walking paths through different desert environments. There are also enclosed Aviaries along the way with different native birds in natural settings, but the best parts of the visit were the Ranger programs included in the price of admission. (Don't let reviews tell you that it is too expensive, you get what you pay for.) Don't miss the Bird Show, it was spectacular. Various raptors circle over your head or pop out from behind logs as if on cue. Some wild native Kites even got into the act! We are pretty knowledgable birders, but we learned a lot about native birds from the presentation. Another highlight was the Aboriginal genealogy presentation. Doug gave a great explanation of Aboriginal laws that govern marriage and family relationships. We learned about the historical importance of 'skin names' in protecting these isolated communities from inter-breeding. The small animal enclosures were OK, like a small local zoo that you might find just about anywhere. We did not do the nocturnal tour, but that might be fun if you have the time.

As the water levels were so low, we had to change boats and have a short walk along a well-formed rocky path, with the opportunity to see some traditional rock art as well. The tour was absolutely worth it. If you have the time and energy, the canoe hire would also be a great option. The only negative experience we had was booking our powered campervan site and the boat tour. The reception staff were brusque to the point of being rude, and later, when I wanted information, the receptionist looked extremely annoyed that I had distracted her from her online fashion e-shopping. also the powered campervan sites were probably the worst we'd encountered in the NT.

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Located way down at the southern end of Kakadu. Its probably best accessed from Katherine or Pine Creek than Darwin. There is a 37km rough dirt road at the end of the blacktop. 4wd is the best option, but once there you will never regret it.

A quick 15 minute climb up the near vertical escarpment will have you at the main attraction. (15mins for the fit and adventurous) Here a spectacular infinity pool sits on the top of the escarpment before plunging hundreds of feet below. The views to the horizon and the paperbark forest surrounding the plunge pool below are sensational. Upstream there are many more secluded swimming holes and a few more flowing waterfalls. Sunset and sunrise are the best times to visit. If the water feature are not enough then this location is topped off with lovely green lawns, bbq's and full hot and cold showers in the camp ground.

It is quite spectacular visually and geologically, but also a great place for kids to clamber around and work off some energy. Be aware though, that if your kids do this, you may be accused of disrespecting a religious site: some snotty elderly (white) Australians said this to us, and then proceeded to climb all over it themselves, just not right to the top.

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was on a 'round Australia tour in the early 90s and that included Alice Springs. From memory we arrived in the morning, saw some sights, left in the afternoon to head to THE Alice Springs (ie, the waterhole that the town is named after, I had a drink, was good) and then we kept going until dusk and camped well away from the place. I don't recall the vibe, this being 30+ years ago, but I do recall the fortifications on some of the shops. I don't know what the answer is, but I can bet it won't be cheap, easy or fast.

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Even if you have had an extensive trip about the region, this is very much worth the visit as it shows so much more wildlife, especially birds. The park contains habitats, plants and animals found in the central Australian desert within about a 600km radius of Alice Springs. The nocturnal house is very good as it not only allows viewing of the marla and bilby but also allows viewing of other animals (Thorny Devil for one) that are difficult to find in the desert. It also has a few snakes that are best viewed here rather than in the wild! There is also a resident perentie worth seeking out and the free-flying bird show in the amphitheatre is a way to get up close to a few local birds. There are numerous aviaries scattered about the park and each contain a number of species of birds native to the area so this is an easy way to see these birds without having to tramp around the desert. As it was close to spring we luckily saw patches of wildflowers starting to bloom and add colour to the area.

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"(Written by my 12 year old son Joe) It was lovely and calm with the desolate landscape. The sunset was beautiful showing off the different colours of Ayers Rock, from a pale red to orange to a darker red and the glowing sun disappearing behind Uluru just made the night perfect. The stargazing trip showed me the real beauty of the night sky with all the patterns of stars and it was very special when we got to look through telescopes and see Mars. Next morning watching the sunrise with my hot chocolate and biscuits in hand was amazing. The desert glowed a stunning orange letting out its magnificence when the sun rose. Walking through the caves and seeing the aboriginal art was magical. As you look closer at the art you can see how each painting means something different by telling a story or showing a moral. Learning about how simple their life style was and how they could only count to four truly shocked me. There are tour guides you can hire to show you around or you can simply wander at your own pace. You can hire a car or take a bus and drive around Ayers Rock to see the different formations and angles of the rock face. It really is important to do this as all the angles of the rock are different. You can hire a car or a bus from the market square in Uluru.The market square was loads of fun as there were a variety of small shops selling little ornaments and my 2 brothers and I played the didgeridoo and had a laugh as all of us failed.",4.5

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"It depends on your definition of ""safe."" Property crime is definitely a major concern, but cross-racial violence is pretty low, and murder/maiming is extremely rare. Most of the violence is domestic, and not against strangers/tourists. The biggest concern for tourists is having your vehicle broken into, windows smashed, etc. The cause of this crime is pretty basic. This a remote town, without any major industry. Tourism is dying thanks to Uluru having its own airport, a bad reputation dissuading inter-state travelers, and a growing lack of interest in local activities. Whenever you have poverty, lack of opportunities, and subpar social programs, crime will always be high. There are also fundamental differences in indigenous culture and ""Westernized"" culture, which contributes to the social unrest. The primary reason Alice Springs makes the news is because of its unique social/racial dynamics which often become the basis for political rhetoric. Liberals blame Labor for being too soft on indigenous offenders, Labor blames the Liberals for lack of support for social programs etc. It is also an internationally recognized location, so it is a convenient topic if you want to garner some quick attention. I have lived here for four years without major issues and rarely feel unsafe, but I also come from a city with prevalent gun violence and a much higher murder rate. My perspective is most definitely skewed compared to those from safer countries.",2.3

After an illness we decided to do this trip now and I wonder now why we left it so long. First the Rock itself is awe inspiring and to touch it leaves tingles. We did not climb it as that would be disrespectful. We chose to take a number of tours with AAT Kings and they also booked our accommodation. We chose the cheapest accommodation options as all we needed was a bed and somewhere to eat - and of course a shower and toilet in our room. We were very happy with our accommodation. The AAT tours often started very very early which does not make for a relaxing holiday, but there were good reasons for this and we were not looking for a relaxing holiday - we wanted to see stuff. All of our AAT tours turned up on time and the drivers/guides were very knowledgeable and very respectful of the original inhabitants.

Reddit/4x4Australia,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"You'll make Kakadu....it is mostly bitumen. As for cape york, stick to the main roads and avoid the offroad tracks. I had a mate who took a prius up to cape york. He put a higher profile offroad tyre on, had a 1 inch lift and dropped his tyre pressures and made it up to the tip. Just slow down on the corrugated roads. Good luck and enjoy it.",3.6

Reddit/AustraliaTravel,Kakadu Gunlom Falls,"Nitmiluk NP is very scenic, but sort of a one-trick pony - with a series of red-rock gorges. Kakadu has a lot more variety, and a lot more crocodiles! The Yellow Waters cruise at Cooinda is wonderful. There's not a lot of difference in the travel times between the two.",3.9
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"A little publicized but excellent way to see Uluru is by riding rented bicycles around the base at your own pace. A walk can very very long, perhaps interesting with a guide, but biking was much cooler, took less time while enabling us to read interesting placards, and a bit of exercise after lots of eating and drinking. Outback Cycles is not pushed as aggressively as many package tours are, and if you are interested in sunrise or sunset tours others may be a better option. However, the HopOn HopOff buses get you into the park and bike rental is at the entrance to the cultural center and could not be easier. Fly nets, for purchase at the IGA, hotels and the cultural center are a MUST, as is drinking water.",4.1

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I lived in Rocky for 8 years, it’s relatively safe and a lovely rural town. Drive a couple hrs and you’re in another lovely little town. I also grew up in the NT. Alice Springs is very isolated and extremely dangerous. It’s not a hard decision.",3.9

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,The sunset at Uluru is awesome. The changing colors are fascinating. This monolith is special and not only at sunset. We joined an interpretive walk and heard more about the Aboriginal culture. It was very interesting. We also walked to cultural sites where we could see the ancient artwork. Uluru should not be missed when travelling in the center.,4.8

Reddit/AskAnAustralian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"I was born in Australia and have travelled extensively around the country, and Alice Springs is the only place I haven’t felt safe in, even during the day time. I’ve been to shitty areas in major cities which were fine during the day. That said, the danger could probably be managed by staying at a nice hotel and avoiding spending time outside at night. I wouldn’t bother spending 5 days there though. So many other nicer places to go in Australia. If you want to see the desert etc. a couple of nights would be enough.",3.2
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,Took [this photo](http://imgur.com/a/u5zPAOo) earlier this year when some dickhead decided to climb even though it was shut down for the day. The Park Ranger gave him a serving and reported him to the police right in front of us. Then he took us on a free tour around Uluru. Was a pretty sweet day all round.,3.8
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"When you're at the end of an easy climb onto a staircase, all of a sudden; a majestic view into history. Descending down into the gorge you will see at the bottom a beautifull and impressive Dali landscape and making your way through to the end you are rewarded with paradise. Jump in and swim/enjoy this garden of Eden. Amazing",4.9
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"The place is special. I didn't expect to be this amazing experience. We were there during Easter holiday, the accommodation around the rock was fully booked. The kids enjoyed the sight seeing very much. We paid respect by followed the sign and statement at the car park by not climbing the rock. Best spot to take the picture would be from designated car or bus bay. We bought a 3 day pass as we really need to get in and out to see the rock at morning, noon, early afternoon and sun set. Worth it! It cost us $65 per car. The drive from park entry is around 10 km. The view while driving closer is stunning. Prepare water, hat with fly net if preferred and sun screen. The walk can be chosen from 2.4 km to the full walk.",4.5
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,This Park is well worth a visit and I recommend that you catch all the displays that run throughout the day they were very informitive. You can spend a lot of time here so allow the whole day. The audio makes it very easy to navigate around the park.,4.5
Reddit/australia,Alice Springs Desert Park,"The trouble is in Alice Springs and the territory there are heaps of different organisations trying to get money to do this and most nights (until all the media attention) you wouldnt even see them out collecting kids to take to the youth centers or anything but, now there is all this attention the town has become safer at night and they are actually doing the jobs they are funded to do the mayor has recently started to campaign for those orgabisations to be held accountable and to share numbers and statistics about what they actually do and where the millions of dollars go cause unless Alice gets a VIP they dont appear to do much.",3.3
TripAdvisor,West MacDonnell – Ormiston Gorge,"Had the pleasure of staying at the wonderful campgrounds at Ormiston Gorge. Despite having a big rig we managed to find a suitable site and throughly enjoyed some of the cleanest facilities ever. The pound walk is wonderful, but the highlight was the pizza night in the kiosk followed by the ranger talk on Wednesday nights. Nick and Beck were very friendly hosts. The kiosk is well stocked with bread, milk, meat packs etc. I was craving a good coffee as hadn't had 1 in a while, surprisingly was the best coffee since we left home. Great place to stay that we could not recommend more highly.",3.9
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We are on a group tour and visited the park. It was a very informative visit, the park is very well maintained and local guide did an excellent presentation of the basic tools which the aboriginal people manufactured and used for their daily life, digging holes, making a fire, hunting etc. The glass boxes were snakes and other nocturnal animals are kept, was also very impressive.",4.7
TripAdvisor,Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu),"If your travelling through the Norther Territory, its worth stopping at the Devils Marbles. You can camp overnight (but can be crowded during peak times of the year) or you can stop and spend a couple of hours looking around. If you want to get some great photos, make sure to go early in the morning or late in the afternoon, as the rising or setting sun brings out the orange and red in the rocks. You could easily spend a couple of hours looking around the area, the rock formations are spread out.",3.2
Reddit/australia,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I can see the situation from which you're probably coming: if you decided to swing by on your way through in like a caravan on a day trip, then yeah, you wouldn't have seen anything until you got inside the park. But if you do basically any research beforehand (there's literally a link entitled 'can I climb uluru' on the Ayers Rock resort webpage with info on the park entrance fee), especially if you've visited the visitors centre at Yulara or Mutitjulu, there's definitely literature asking you not to climb. Even if you do pay the 25 to get in, you can still use that to walk around parts of Uluru, and Kata Tjuta. Also, it's a park. It's not like a museum with no paintings or a doctors surgery with no doctors-- you're paying for entry into a park, you get entry into a park.",3.3

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,Gunlom features a pool at the bottom of the waterfall that is accessible for almost anybody. This is a large pool that is deep only a short distance from the edge. Be careful if you or your children cannot swim competently. But it is a great place. The plunge pools are located ABOVE the waterfall. Getting there involves a solid walk/climb up a very steep track and takes 40 minutes or so. The reward is a really refreshing dip in either/both of two pools and a spectacular view out over the wetlands below. (Also crocodiles can't climb up the waterfall so the plunge pools are guaranteed safe 12 months of the year. The lower pool needs to be checked after the end of the wet season each year). You will appreciate another swim in the lower pool by the time you get back to the bottom again. Be aware of the distances involved in visiting Kakadu. Gunlom is some 140 km/80 miles from Jabiru and the side road to access it off the Kakadu Highway is a rough dirt road. It is about an hour from the turnoff to Gunlom - this is not a road where you will be travelling fast.,4.1
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,Spent a pleasant 3 hours here. The photo opp with the birds is very well priced. The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable,4.6
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Well, why wouldn't you. You must And yes sunrise and sunset are best as the colour does change significantly over 15 min or so. Would recommend a guided tour, if not the whole of the way around then at least the shorter free tour given by the rangers at 8am",3.3
Reddit/australian,Alice Springs Desert Park,"Look you both are right to some extent. Sure the lost generation was not even that long ago and that it was horrendous. For that you are correct. However he is also correct in saying aboriginals need to look inward to adapt to the new world. The world is not the same as it was even 20 years ago. Everyone needs to adapt, it should not be white vs aboriginal. White people wouldn't have been successful in mapping some of the territory without them and the aboriginals wouldn't have western medicine or western amenities like cars, horses etc. Alice Springs in the top 20 dangerous cities in the world (might be top 40) but that is not acceptable especially when a lot of funding is put towards the community and the elders need to be held accountable.",2.9
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This tour was so worth while - so many endangered creatures all in one place without fences between you and them. We saw Mala, Bilbies, Bettongs just to name a few. The staff were friendly and very knowledgeable. There were refreshments as well. All in all I would highly recommend this tour.",4.8
GoogleMaps,Alice Springs Desert Park,The nocturnal experience is fantastic.,4.7
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"We got the most out of the nocturnal viewing (outside at night) and the two great shows we went to (Aboriginal talk and bird show). In the indoor nocturnal exhibit it was difficult to catch sight of all the animals and we missed seeing the golden bandicoot and bilby. A highlight was the thorny devil. The bird show was amazing to see up close galahs, southern boobook, bush stone curlew, brown falcon, whistling kite and black kite. Spinifex pigeons also flew past.",4.2
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a big park, perfectly maintained and easy to get around. The video at the start is amazing so don't miss it. The surprise ending brought tears to my eyes to see such beauty. The nocturnal house is wonderful. I never expected to be able to see these rare and endangered animals in such a wonderful setting. The Park's guide, who explained to us the traditional practice of firing the land and how this actually helps preserve the animals, was super informative. To see all the birds up close was a real thrill. Also the shop has excellent souvenirs, lots of choice and reasonable prices. A great day out.",4.8
TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Great place, the rock is amazing and must be seen. The red sands of the national park is beautiful. Not much wild. Life to be Seen other than in the parks due to the heat this time of year. Prepare to be bombarded by more flies than you have ever imagined. The flies are a pain in the butt, but they add to the experience. Local people are all so friendly and nice. Food and things are very expensive but there is an IGA that has reasonable prices. Indiginous art and artifacts prices are off the scale for. Pricing. Pack your wallet for this adventure.",4.4

Reddit/AustralianPolitics,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Let's all face it. Not a single person in this comment section actually believes that the Uluru statement is only one page, there is simply too much evidence to the contrary. The final council report refers to parts of the remaining 25 pages (our story + roadmap) as the Uluru statement, and both Megan Davis and Pat Anderson have been on record saying as much. This is a blatant *Ministry of Truth* style retelling of history. It is a complete and utter lie, and anyone involved closely in the debate knows it, and the fact that the only active supporters of the voice left are the ones that are willing to toe the line to the point of point-blank lying should be enough to spell death for this referendum. The yes camp has shown nothing but contempt for the average Australian, the broader public is not that stupid, no amount of ""fact checks"" or propaganda in our national broadcaster can hope to convince people over the cold-hard fact that there is ample video footage of the Uluru statement's architects saying that it is in fact, more than one page.",1.3

TripAdvisor,Kakadu National Park – Gunlom Falls,"Driving from Cooinda, Kakadu, down to Katherine we wanted to see the much raved about Gunlom falls and the Infinity pools and it didn't disappoint. Firstly the drive in is a good 20 to 40 minutes over corrugated roads, it pays to let a bit of air out of the tires (10psi is just enough if you don't have your own compressor) to make it more bearable though you won't be able to air back up until Pine Creek some 40mins down the highway or Cooinda lodge some 1hr 20 toward the north. We decided to trek to the top first which would be quite challenging for some but taking your time most people could do it. You do have to climb over rocks on the walk so be aware of that and even though i didn't id recommend most people wear shoes to make it easier. Being late in the season the water wasn't flowing so much and the water was a bit green from algae but it was amazing to lay in and take in the views. Saying this we did walk back down and swim in the water hole at the bottom which is right near the carpark and was absolutely stunning with a nice sandy bottom ...and the water was cleaner too. I would recommend anyone with health issues or troubles walking just to enjoy the water hole down the bottom..its just as pretty.",3.8

TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,"This is a very good desert nature park with a large number of animals reptiles and birds, many of which you would not likely see on your own outside the park. There are the standard dingos, kangaroos, and emus that everyone is familiar with but also numerous lizards and snakes and birds, and a great nocturnal house for the things that only show themselves at night. There are several talks and demonstrations during the day in different areas of the park, including a very interesting free flight bird show held twice a day. The only drawback is the size of the park. It is spread out quite a bit and requires a lot of walking, which would not be a problem except for the extreme desert heat. Don't forget your hat and sunscreen.",4.0

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"I'm not sure how I could possibly put into words how special Uluru is or how to do it better than the hundreds of writers here on this site who've gone before me. Suffice to say it is a deeply spiritual place, very moving, utterly beautiful and compelling and deeply relaxing. The Aboriginals had the right idea about being in tune with nature here, at one with their ancestry amid a deep sense of time and history. The rock is sacred to them and I can see why. Or rather I could feel why. It is stunning to behold at any time but especially when lit by the dawn and it almost glows red. Sunset is similar. It remains one of my strongest memories of my first visit to Australia almost 20 years ago, camping near Uluru watching the sun set. This time I knew what to expect but that didn't diminish it's majesty in any way. A good guide to take you around the base is essential so as not to miss some of the ancient art on the rock and in the caves. An absolute delight and well worth the inevitable long journey to reach it as it is so mercifully far from the madding crowds!",4.4
TripAdvisor,Alice Springs Desert Park,The desert park is perhaps something you wouldn’t ordinarily want to go to. However once you are in the park you are able to learn about the life plants and inhabitants in the desert and how they survive. We heard the aboriginal talk and the guided night time desert life talk and both were fascinating and informative. The park is nicely laid out and a beautiful area for sharing the lives of the desert land aboriginal worlds and the beauty of the desert in all its glory,4.2

TripAdvisor,Uluru-Kata Tjuta,"Sunrise at Uluru was lovely especially with The Olgas in the background. The Resorts are pricey but I guess being in the middle of no-where this is to be expected, although were surprised at the reasonable prices at the IGA in Town Centre. The whole place is spotless and the rooms and facilities at Outback Pioneer were good value compared with some of the other places. Do book with the breakfast option though as prices at Bough House were ridiculous ($30 for CONTINENTAL and $36 for FULL but could be pre-purchased at Reception for $27). The rock itself is fascinating - we did the bike ride around the base and I have written a separate review for this. Everything runs like clock-work so a credit to Voyages. Only slight downside is 1 day passes aren't available for National Park and having to pay $25pp for a 3 day National Park Pass when only needed for the 1 day. Obviously this is not the fault of the Resort though. Excellent choice of Cafe's in Town Centre for meals if don't want to pay the ridiculous prices at the resort restaurants.",3.7
