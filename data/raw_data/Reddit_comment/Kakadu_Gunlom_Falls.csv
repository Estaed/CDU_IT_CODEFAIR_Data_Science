4sg112,d591eg0,travel,Luwife,1468319835.0,I just went to Kakadu last week. I went just in a day tour though with AAT Kings. It was quite expensive and was a lot of driving from Darwin for one day. I'd suggest renting a car or maybe just finding a bus or something that can do one way. There are campsites and resorts etc in Kakadu as I'm sure you are aware. I'm not sure about exploring solo as I have never done it nor really have I thought about it. It's truly beautiful there and there are people around all the time at the popular spots in the parks.
1bt1a0o,kxjh0mm,darwin,ammym,1711978207.0,"Day 2 - you could do jumping crocs on your way out to jabiru.  Go to cahills crossing first and then do ubirr for sunset!   I would squish your day 3 & 4 activities in together.  Get up super early and drive to cooinda and do the sunrise yellow water cruise, then do the rock art sites on your way back. Or do the opposite and drive to cooinda and do the sunset tour, if you want to stay there.   Then day 4 do a waterfall tour - think I did a tour with Kakadu tourism, Kakadu adventure tour.   Fogg dam is nice for wildlife watching but think you probably need a good hour or so.   Why lake Bennett? Are you going to stay there and use as base for Litchfield? I would stay at Litchfield overnight and have a bit more chill time there. And do Florence & buley on day 6 and then Wangi and other waterfalls on day 7 - You can also do the cascades if you’re both willing to walk a bit. "
1bt1a0o,kxjfg30,darwin,illogicallyalex,1711977544.0,"I would slot Fogg dam into your Day 2 itinerary in the morning on the way through to Jabiru tbh since unless you plan to do the walks you’ll likely not spend more than an hour max at Fogg dam. Then you could go down the Kakadu Hway to Pine Creek from Jabiru on your way back, then come up to Lake Bennett. That’ll also bring you passed Adelaide River with the war memorial if you’re into that   For Day 3 you might be best giving yourself the afternoon off if it’s a particularly hot day, since the walk around Nourlangie can take it out of you a bit."
1bt1a0o,kxmobd2,darwin,daschund_dasha,1712018766.0,"1. The best time to be at Nawurlandja is sunset. 2. Do the Nanguluwurr walk at Nourlangie. Early morning if possible - it can be super spiritual being there alone. 3. Kubara pools walk, on a separate fork down the road to Nourlangie, is a nice walk. 4. If the Nourlangie Barrk walk is open in August, I would count it as a MUST do. Even the first little bit where you ascend to the top of the outlier, which takes about 30 minutes. 5. Ubirr can be super hot during the middle of the day, would highly recommend morning or afternoon to beat the crowds (it's one of the busiest attractions). Honestly when there's a lot of other people at these places in Kakadu it completely fucking ruins it. It is COMPLETELY different for example when I was there during COVID and I'd rock up to a place nine times out of ten and there was no one else there. 6. Scenic flight over Jim Jim/Twin in a helicopter is pretty speccy (from Jabiru) 7. Maguk is 2WD accessible. if you're adventurous you can also drive to the 4WD trailhead (the last ~5km of the track in) at Jim Jim and hitch a ride in with some other people."
1bt1a0o,kxjjw9g,darwin,PerthNandos,1711979374.0,My advice for getting the most out of Kakadu - try and do the wetlands and falls early in the day.   Sunrise over the wetlands is amazing - just you (if you are lucky) and the birds. You will see other wildlife at this time too.  Same with the falls. Being at Jim Jim alone is an intense experience.   You will see beautiful things either way but going early beats most tourists and the heat of the day.
1bt1a0o,kxmw37q,darwin,makeitlegalaussie,1712021727.0,That’s gunna be busy busy. Maguk does say 4x4 only but iv seen 2 wheel drive cars make it with ease. I live in Kakadu
1fmhzyv,lob511e,darwin,mycooltheeyo,1726974364.0,"If I had one whole day I’d go into Kakadu via Kakadu hway from pine creek and have a swim at barramundi gorge, then you can do a boat tour at yellow water, continue up to the border of arnham land to see the crocs at cahills crossing and head back to Darin via arnham hway stopping in at Ubir to see the rock art and this is a great spot to watch the sun go down.  There are lots more to do but you can’t fit it all in one day."

I was in Kakadu mid last week - beautiful and full of wildlife. The yellow water cruises were amazing. I did sunset and morning cruises. If I had to choose one, I’d go with the sunset cruise starting at 1630. Crocs galore, and the rest. Terrific guide (didn’t get her name unfortunately). Have fun!"
1fmhzyv,lob7286,darwin,mycooltheeyo,1726975297.0,"Ooh my apologies. I can’t help there, I’ve never taken a guided tour myself.  I can recommend taking a head net though.. the flies in Kakadu are next level.. and after dark the mozzies are the worst I’ve ever experienced. I spent a couple nights sleeping in a hammock getting out to pockocks beach at east alligator head and donated a couple quarts of blood to the mozzie population."

luwcy2,gp9zl9q,australia,None,1614583033.0,"As someone commented, the term originated in Canada, but I don't see why it can't be used in Australia. For one thing, it's First Nation**s** plural, since as you point out Aboriginal people are not one homogenous group. Looking up the definition of 'nation' gives me ""a body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory"". I don't see why that couldn't apply to each tribe. Different people will prefer different terms but some find 'First Nations' or 'First Peoples' more respectful than 'Aboriginal' or 'Indigenous'.  Obviously it's not a traditional Aboriginal title, but neither are the terms ""Aboriginal"" or ""Indigenous"".  It would certainly be nice if people used more specific tribe/nation names where possible though. I understand the traditional owners of Kakadu are Bininj and Mungguy."
luwcy2,gpa829l,australia,None,1614591050.0,"Just to elaborate on /u/YinaarGomeroi , it's First NATIONS. It is a good term to describe Aboriginal peoples because of the diversity of language and culture. Australia is HUGE and a place like Kakadu is VERY unique with its own seasons, animals, landscape and resultant way of life. A way of life completely different to how the people in say the Darling / Barwon river area or the people on the south east QLD coast would have lived. Also not to mention people in Kakadu would not intermingle with people on the east or west coast unless they happened to permanently migrate there. It's too far to walk just to have a corroboree."

Most of the sites will probably still be open, but you'll find it more difficult to get a tour to them and may need your own transport.

Beautiful beaches and decent wild life. There are wineries and a few things to do but honestly, if you want to visit somewhere that might blow your mind kakadu is the place to go. It will be hot and uncomfortable but you will see big crocs at cahills and the fishing will be firing up so get a fishing rod and catch some barra. Indigenous culture is very strong so you will meet interesting people and the yellow water cruise cannot be topped in australia in my opinion. On your way to kakadu you can stop at the humpty doo pub and visit the jumping crocs.   Feel free to ask questions if you have any."

If you really can stand the humidity it’s a kind of amazing experience and the sunsets tend to be even better cos of the humidity, but you honestly are so hot and the air feels oppressive and  electric waiting for a storm that usually won’t arrive til December or Jan, it’s a very intense time.

Davranış bozukluklarına en yatkın türler oluyor bu aşırı enerjik türler. Mutlu edilmezlerse, ki mutlu edebilmek gerçekten zor, kendilerine zarar vermeye başlıyorlar. Buna başladıklarında da tamamen iyileşebilme çok nadir.  OP, şunu da belirtmek lazım ki papağana verdiğin paranın yakınını bakımında kullanacağın eşyalara da vereceksin. Böyle kontrol edilmesi zor türler spesifik yaşam koşulları ve bir sürü ilgi, para istiyor. Kakadu alacaksan masraf olarak büyük türlerde 150k, küçük türlerde 60-70k, kayık alacaksan da 40-50k ödemeye hazır ol. Veteriner masrafları dahil de değil. Piyasada bulduğun büyük kafesler bile yeterli olmayacaktır bir kakaduya. Mesela profilimden kendi kafesimi görebilirsin, piyasadaki en büyük kafeslerden biri ve ona en fazla kayık, küçük tür konur, pakistan papağanı falan konur.

1gbejhu,ltmp1qk,australian,Xevram,1729828058.0,"Fair enough it's a fed govt agency so the fine is ultimately paid by tax payers. So us tax payers are really asking Parks Australia North, PAN to do better.  But there is a lot more nuance to the whole saga.   Markham senior was a friend and work colleague for many years, we talked this issue though quite a few times. In the first instance the  various sites had been well mapped and Anthropologicaly certified. PAN knew and had all that information. They did follow consulting process re location of the proposed walkway, impact(s) and cultural sensitivity. Then they went ahead and had it constructed in the wrong location contrary to what had been understood.  More to it but that is the gist of it.   M Markham and families were put under considerable pressure to keep Gunlom falls, campsite open, but with the track closed. But a very important point had to be made and a precedent underlined and set in stone. So no deal.  Topend and Katherine region tourism suffered, operators had to redesign itineraries etc etc. BUT first nations people and the custodians had full support from the vast majority of tourism interests.  As an aside, the only reason PAN is the 'governing' body in Kakadu is because of its world heritage status. Elsewhere in the NT it's parks and wildlife. An outstanding group of professionals with excellent trust and rapport with first nations people. So quite a few of the first nation's groups in and around Kakadu are not happy, comfortable or really trusting of PAN.  Note World heritage status was not something that first nations custodians asked for. Government of the day pushed it ahead. It's a good thing in many ways, but PAN well maybe not so much."

Probably the biggest selling point to buying the VX and Kakadu is that KDSS suspension. It’s absolutely brilliant for both off-road AND on-road use.

9p7xxg,ehb69s5,travel,mandragara,1551172662.0,Must be. Did you do nice things up there in October? How long did you spend in Kakadu? Any storms? The waterfalls can be a bit acidic after the first rains
9p7xxg,ehb6d2c,travel,Kiwitechgirl,1551172824.0,"We had an amazing time - we had three days in Kakadu and were there for the first storm of the wet season which was pretty amazing! We visited Ubirr, Nourlangie, Yellow Water, did an Arnhem Land day trip, scenic flight and the Warradjan Cultural Centre.  Such an incredible place."
9p7xxg,ehb816p,travel,mandragara,1551175896.0,"That's a pretty good mix of things!  I went up on the 8th of Feb. Did Litchfield, Kakadu (Barrk walk around Nourlangie, Yellow Water, Gubara, Yirmikmik, Ikoymarrwa etc), then Katherine (Butterfly gorge, Sweetwater etc).  Amazing area I agree, I'm going to be looking to do some 2 night off track walks next time I go up. This place has some good stuff but it's so expensive! https://www.bushwalkingholidays.com.au/kakadu-trips.shtml"

1ach0jg,kjwsnty,AustraliaTravel,downundarob,1706417717.0,"The drive from Alice to Yulara (Uluru) will take you around 5 hours, please do not drive this in the late afternoon or on dusk, as you will be driving into the sun and the Lasseter Highway is statistically one of the most dangerous roads in the NT.  You will not need a 4wd for any of this area, but I would recommend a Camry or larger (a full size car). As you approach Uluru you can probably have some fun with 'fooluru' (Mount Conner)  There is only Yulara at Uluru, regardless of where you choose to stay it is going to be not cheap, for family friendly look at Outback Lodge or the Campground. Remember the climb **is closed** so if you were planning on that, forget about it. If your budget extends far enough a helicopter flight over the rock is well advised.  If you line up Darwin for a Thursday you will be able to experience the world famous Mindil Beach Sunset Markets.  As for Kakadu, book yourself in at Cooinda for night one, do the yellow waters cruise for sunrise, then move yourself up to Jabiru for sunset at Ubirr and then take in Nourlangie the next day, make sure you have tough walking shoes for all of this, and carry water.   I would also suggest you invest in some UHF CB Radio handhelds (you may be able to rent these) as they help communicate car to car on the roads, Channel 40 for trucks and 18 for RVs, you may also want to consider renting a Personal Locator Beacon."
1ach0jg,kjxasod,AustraliaTravel,Yeahnahyeahprobs,1706428192.0,"4 days is too long for Uluru. Save one and include Litchfield (Wangi Falls, Florence Falls) on the Darwin leg.  In Kakadu, don't miss a Yellow Water billabong cruise at Cooinda.   The drives are long, take your time and enjoy the landscapes."
1ach0jg,kk35je6,AustraliaTravel,None,1706523979.0,Yep.  Litchfield is wonderful.  If you can do the cruise (if it is still offered) at Kakadu.  I loved it!  Get your kids to keep an eye out for the jacanas.  (lily walking little birds with huge toes.)
1ach0jg,kjxo2r2,AustraliaTravel,Dai_92,1706437757.0,"Kings cannoy is amazing, I liked it better than Uluru, the climb at the start is a bit challenging fitness wise, but once you do that its pretty flat the down hill the other side. Go first thing like before the sun and you get a great view of the sun bouncing off the cannyon.  Your plan is pretty good, simliar to what I did. I'd go 6 days total in Alice leg, 2 in alice, 2 in kings canyon and 2 in Uluru including driving as there is stuff on the way to do. Darwin has some great attractions, heaps of WW2 stuff, and the croc cage is awesome. If you got some more time Katherine and Katherine Gorge is pretty good to, it's only a few hours below Kakadu."
1ach0jg,kk2wsfo,AustraliaTravel,UncleSnogga,1706517277.0,"I can highly recommend part of a trip we did.  We went from Darwin to Litchfield, to Kakadu, into gove (have family there) the down to Alice.  From Alice we spent a day trip out to the east Macdonald ranges, then out to the west Mac's, staying at Redbank gorge, then we got bored there after 2days and went to palm valley, I loved palm valley and would say it is a must.  Then there is a little town near the road into palm valley, at the local shop/servo you can buy the permit to do the mereenie loop (sort of a short cut to Kings canyon.  Then from Kings down to Uluru and Kata juta.  I thought Bulli rock hole at Litchfield was awesome we stay at Florence falls campground, and you could go to Bulli after all the tourist bus's have left and just about have to place to yourself.  Mataranka is good for a night, the springs are better at bitter springs, but the caravan park at mataranka hot springs put on a show every night which is a nice change. Katherine gorge was good but I wouldn't go back. King canyon is a must, it's insane the scale of it, be prepared for a big walk, but it's worth it, I also thought Kata juta was better than Uluru but that's probably because it's less touristy, we did a sunset helicopter flight over both, and it was amazing.  I know this is a bit all over the shop, but I will say if you want to stay at any of the public camp spots like Redbank, Florence falls, or Palm valley, make sure you get there early as the spots get filled up very early.  And the private parks at Kings canyon and Yulara (Uluru) checking wait time was about an hour at both.  But the water pressure in the showers at Kings canyon was worth the wait."
