A walk up to the first try ascent is welcome but well worth it. There is a great cafe and food station. Stay away and do not mix with the villagers.

We had shame and embarrassment not to wear them however it did suit the time and place. There is a shop where the guests stay adjacent to the base where the rocks form the scenery. The car park is quite short and steep and very confusing as everyone claims they saw colde...",Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge) offers cooler temperatures and peaceful natural settings.
